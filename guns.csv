Canada has only “had 11 school shooting deaths … in history.”,"Recent Facebook posts advocating for gun restrictions argue that such policies have worked so well in Canada there have been less than a dozen school shooting deaths in the country’s history.  ""Canadian here, your neighbour with cold winters and sensible gun laws,"" reads a screenshot of a tweet in two different Facebook posts. ""Did you know we’ve had 11 school shooting deaths? Not this month or this year, but total, in history. And absolutely no deaths in elementary schools. Why? Because gun laws save lives.""  These posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram.) The original tweet was published in June 2022, less than two weeks after the deadly elementary school shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, left 21 people dead. That tweet included in its Twitter thread a caveat that’s missing in these Facebook posts: The original poster was focusing on shootings at primary and secondary schools in Canada, not colleges and universities.  In February 2022, The Toronto Star published ""a list of some past Canadian school shootings."" In 2016, after four people were killed in a shooting in the Saskatchewan community of La Loche, the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. published a list of other deadly school shootings in Canada.  Here’s what we found reviewing both lists and looking elsewhere for reports of deadly school shootings in Canada.  Daycare, primary and secondary school shootings  Depending on how you cut the numbers, we identified 11 people who died in day care, primary and secondary school shootings in Canada’s history. But that number rises to 15 with the inclusion of four other victims: two boys who were shot at their home before the perpetrator (a high school student) shot two employees at his school; a teacher who was killed by her estranged husband in a school parking lot; and a former student who was shot in front of his old school. The death toll would rise again to 18 with the inclusion of three suspects who killed themselves at the schools.  Here are the incidents when those deaths occurred. October 2022, one dead: An 18-year-old and former student of Woburn Collegiate Institute, a high school, was shot and killed in a shooting in front of the campus.  February 2022, one dead: A 14-year-old was charged with first-degree murder after an 18-year-old died after a shooting at a high school in Toronto.  January 2016, four dead: A La Loche Community School student shot and killed two teenage boys at their home and then two employees at the Saskatchewan high school.  April 2013, two dead: A 38-year-old employee was shot and killed at the day care facility of Les Racines de vie Montessori in Gatineau, Quebec. The perpetrator then killed himself. May 2007, one dead: A 15-year-old died after being shot at C.W. Jefferys Collegiate Institute, a high school in Toronto.  December 2004, one dead: A teacher at Bramalea Secondary School in Brampton, Ontario, was shot and killed in the parking lot by her estranged husband. Police considered the incident a domestic dispute, according to the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. April 1999, one dead: A 17-year-old student is shot and killed at W.R. Myers High in Taber, Alberta. October 1978, one dead: A 16-year-old was killed in a shooting at Sturgeon Creek School, a high school in Winnipeg, Manitoba.  October 1975, three dead: Two people were killed after an 18-year-old student at Saint Pius X, a secondary school in Ottawa, opened fire on his classmates. He killed himself.  May 1975, three dead: A 16-year-old student killed two people and then himself at Brampton Centennial Secondary School in Ontario.  College and university shootings Twenty-five other people, including two suspects who killed themselves at the campuses, have died in shootings at colleges and universities in Canada.  February 2022, one dead: A 12th grader was killed in a shooting at Woburn Collegiate Institute, a high school in Scarborough.  June 2012, three dead: Three people were killed in a robbery at the University of Alberta in Edmonton. September 2006, two dead: An 18-year-old was killed when a gunman opened fire at Dawson College in Laval, Quebec. The shooter killed himself.  December 1989, 15 dead: A 25-year-old shot and killed 14 women at Ecole Polytechnique, a university in Montreal. The shooter killed himself. August 1992, four dead: A professor at Concordia University in Montreal shot and killed four of his colleagues.  Even though gun ownership is relatively high in Canada, according to the Council on Foreign Relations, the country doesn’t struggle with the same level of gun violence as in the United States. The 1989 shooting at Ecole Polytechnique is ""widely credited with driving major gun reforms"" in Canada, the think tank says, including a 28-day waiting period for gun purchases, mandatory safety training courses, bans on large-capacity magazines and greater restrictions on military-style weapons.   Our ruling The posts claim Canada has had only 11 school shooting deaths in history. Under the narrowest interpretation of a school shooting victim — on campus, not considered a domestic violence incident and not including suspects who died by suicide after the attack — that appears to be correct.  It leaves out important details: About two dozen other people have been killed in school shootings on college and university campuses. Plus, at least four other victims connected to shootings on primary and secondary school campuses aren’t counted here",Half True,"February 23, 2023"

Law enforcement later confirmed that all the victims are students. But even as the scene was still active, a wave of posts misidentifying the gunman began to spread on Twitter and Facebook. ""#BREAKING: Michigan State University SHOOTING SUSPECT is 21 year old ‘Lynn Dee Walker’ according to dispatch audio. He is still on the loose and considered armed and dangerous,"" read one viral tweet, which displayed images of Walker and was quickly cross-posted to Facebook as a screenshot.  One Facebook post claimed that Walker had ""made threats earlier"" on the platform about his plans.   These posts are dangerous and inaccurate, and were flagged as part of Instagram’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

Authorities have identified the gunman as 43-year-old Anthony Dwayne McRae, who died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound off campus after he was confronted by law enforcement.  Many of the social media posts naming Walker credit police scanner chatter for the information. Regardless of whether his name was mentioned, scanner traffic (especially during an incident) is notoriously unreliable and comprises tips, rumors and unconfirmed reports.  Police said the actual suspect, McRae, wasn’t affiliated with the university as a student or an employee, and is believed to have acted alone. ""We have no idea why he came to campus to do this tonight,"" Michigan State University Interim Deputy Police Chief Chris Rozman said during an early morning Feb. 14 news conference.

“You know how many children are dying across Virginia because of fentanyl poisoning? A heck of a lot more than are dying at the hands of guns.”,"Firearms or fentanyl? Which causes more child deaths in Virginia? During a recent floor debate, state Sen. Mark Obenshain, R–Rockingham, erroneously claimed it is fentanyl. Obenshain, an ardent gun rights defender, spoke against a bill sponsored by state Sen. Jennifer Boysko, D–Fairfax, that would require gun owners who live with minors to lock their firearms and ammunition in cabinets or containers. Violators could face a $250 fine. He was miffed that Democrats were supporting the legislation after voicing concerns about another bill, sponsored by Sen. Bryce Reeves, R–Spotsylvania, that would classify fentanyl as a ""weapon of terrorism"" — and subject makers or distributors of the synthetic opioid to at least 20 years in prison. ""You know how many children are dying across Virginia because of fentanyl poisoning?"" Obenshain asked. ""A heck of a lot more than are dying at the hands of firearms."" We asked Obenshain and his office four times for the source of his statistics and did not receive a reply by press time. Records from the office of Virginia’s chief medical examiner rebut Obenshain's claim, showing that almost seven times more minors died from guns than fentanyl from the start of 2017 through September 2022. During that span, 355 minors died from guns and 51 from fentanyl.  Of those total 51 fentanyl deaths, 40 have been listed as accidental overdoses. And of the 355 gun-related deaths of minors during the last six years, 198 were homicides and 132 were suicides. State records show the number of minors dying from fentanyl and guns is rising. There were nine deaths from fentanyl in 2020, 13 in 2021, and 21 in last year’s first nine months. There were 70 gun-related deaths in 2020, 77 in 2021 and 69 in the first three quarters of 2022. Sixty-five percent of minors who died from fentanyl were 15 to 17 years old. Seventy-two percent who died from gunfire were in that age bracket. It should be noted that when all Virginians are counted — minors and adults — more died from fentanyl than guns during the last six years. State records show 7,718 fentanyl deaths from the start of 2017 through September 2022, compared with 6,874 gun-related deaths. Boysko’s SB 1139 to require gun owners who live with minors to lock up their guns passed the Democratic-led Senate on a mostly partisan vote. It might have a tougher time in the Republican-led House of Delegates. Reeves’s SB 1188  to classify fentanyl as a ""weapon of terrorism"" has advanced to the Senate floor with a watered-down maximum penalty of 10 years in prison for those who ""knowingly"" manufacture or distribute the drug. Obenshain said, ""You know how many children are dying across Virginia because of fentanyl poisoning? A heck of a lot more than are dying at the hands of guns."" The senator was wrong. Records from the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner of Virginia show that from the start of 2017 through September 2022, 355 minors had gun-related deaths and 51 died from fentanyl",False,"February 7, 2023"
"""(Ron) DeSantis' bill would remove: background checks, instruction, training and oversight.""","As California’s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, promoted a new bill restricting who can carry a concealed firearm in his state, he said Florida was moving in the ""exact opposite direction."" ""The governor of Florida wants to move without any permits or any consideration, no requirements whatsoever, none for training,"" Newsom said at a Feb. 1 news conference. Newsom has also criticized Florida's Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis on Twitter. ""FACT: Permitless carry does not make you safer. States that allow concealed carry have higher gun homicide rates,"" Newsom tweeted Jan. 30. ""DeSantis' bill would remove: background checks, instruction, training (and) oversight.""  Newsom was referring to a bill introduced by state Rep. Chuck Brannan III, R-Macclenny, that would allow people to carry concealed guns in public without a Florida license. DeSantis hasn’t commented publicly on the bill, HB 543, but has said he would sign a bill allowing people to carry firearms in public without a permit.  Does HB 543 remove gun background checks, instruction, training and oversight, as Newsom claimed?  Because getting a license becomes voluntary under the bill, those requirements would no longer be needed to carry a gun in Florida. But the concealed carry license would remain for those who want it, and background checks on gun purchases from federal dealers would remain in effect. Newsom's tweet gave the impression that HB 543 will no longer require people to pass background checks, receive instruction or training or have oversight if they want to carry a concealed weapon. HB 543 would not eliminate the requirements for obtaining a concealed carry license in Florida. But people would no longer be required to have such a license before entering public spaces with a concealed firearm.  A Newsom spokesperson told PolitiFact that the governor was ""referencing the fact that these requirements would become voluntary under this new law."" Under existing Florida law, people who wish to carry concealed weapons in public must obtain a license from the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. Applicants must: Be a citizen or lawful permanent resident of the United States;  Be at least 21 years old;  ""Desire a legal means to carry a concealed weapon"" for lawful self-defense; Pass a fingerprint-based background check; Complete a firearms training class, among other requirements.   More than 2 million Floridians have a concealed weapon license, according to the agriculture department. If passed, HB 543 will authorize people to conceal weapons in public, without a license, if they meet the age and citizenship or permanent residency criteria, among other requirements. However, people don’t need to pass a background check, demonstrate competency with a firearm or affirm that the weapon is for self-defense. The bill requires gun carriers to have valid government-issued ID and present it to a law enforcement officer when asked. ""If this bill passes as written, there will be no law in Florida requiring government oversight, instruction, training, or a background check to carry a concealed weapon,"" said Aubrey Jewett, a University of Central Florida political science professor.  Jewett noted that the process of purchasing a weapon, which can include a background check, is untouched by HB 543.  Even if HB 453 becomes law, licensed gun sellers will still be required to conduct background checks on prospective buyers based on a federal requirement. Private sellers, however, don’t need to run background checks. Gun policy experts have said that making concealed weapon licenses optional could make it easier for people to entirely avoid a background check if they buy from private sellers. DeSantis' office did not answer specific questions about the legislation. Brannan, who introduced HB 543, did not respond to our request for comment.  Newsom said DeSantis' legislation would ""remove background checks, instruction, training and oversight."" That's misleading. DeSantis has said he would support a bill that allows people to carry firearms in public without a permit. At the time of Newsom’s claim, DeSantis had not publicly commented on HB 543.  Under that proposal, people are not required to have a concealed weapon license; obtaining such a license is voluntary. However, if people choose to get a license, they must undergo a background check, prove firearms competency and meet other requirements.  The bill does not change the federal requirement that people pass a background check when they buy a weapon from a licensed seller. Private sellers are not required to run background checks.  Newsom's claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details",Half True,"February 6, 2023"
“The USA has a gun homicide rate 26 times higher than our peers.”,"Two shootings. Three days. Eighteen people dead. California is reeling from two mass shootings: one in Monterey Park on Jan. 21 that killed 11 people, and another one in Half Moon Bay on Jan. 24 that killed seven.  Gov. Gavin Newsom, D-Calif., bemoaned the level of gun violence in the U.S. and blamed Republicans for opposing gun restrictions.  ""Every country struggles with mental illness. But the USA has a gun homicide rate 26 TIMES HIGHER than our peers,"" Newsom tweeted Jan. 23. ""The difference is how the @GOP have bowed down to the gun industry. The difference is how easy it is to access to (sic) guns and high capacity magazines in our country.""  Every country struggles with mental illness.But the USA has a gun homicide rate 26 TIMES HIGHER than our peers.The difference is how the @GOP have bowed down to the gun industry. The difference is how easy it is to access to guns and high capacity magazines in our country. We’ve heard similar claims before and wanted to check out Newsom’s statistic. Newsom’s office directed us to a data analysis from the gun advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety. The group, a project of former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, compared gun homicide rates for 29 high-income countries and found the United States' rate is 26 times higher than the average of the other countries. Everytown used data from GunPolicy.org at the University of Sydney School of Public Health. In 2019, the year used by Everytown, the U.S. had a gun homicide rate of 4.38 per 100,000 people. The next high-income country on the list was Chile, with a rate of less than 1 per 100,000. (The U.S. gun homicide rate rose to 5.9 in 2020, the Centers for Disease and Prevention reported.) Mexico’s gun homicide rate is higher than the U.S.’, but the World Bank does not consider Mexico as high-income.  Other studies offer similar results as Everytown. A 2019 study in the Journal of Preventive Medicine found the 2015 U.S. gun homicide rate was 25 times higher than other high-income countries. A 2021 study from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington found the U.S. gun homicide rate is 23 times higher than the entire European Union.  The number varies based on what is considered a ""high-income"" country. Everytown selected countries that are considered high-income by the World Bank, are members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, and offer gun homicide data. Altering the mix of countries examined doesn’t do much to change the point that the U.S. gun homicide rate is significantly higher than similarly situated peers.  ""There are many factors that explain why violence happens, why someone might be at risk of violence, and almost all of those factors are present in every other country,"" Ari Freilich, state policy director at the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence told PolitiFact, naming factors such as mental illness and exposure to violent movies and video games. One difference is the availability of guns in the U.S.  Americans owned around 393 million guns, according to a Small Arms Survey report by the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva.  That’s about 1.2 guns per resident, the highest rate among 56 nations and territories surveyed. Yemen had the second highest rate at 0.53 guns per resident — less than half the U.S. rate.  The Giffords Law Center says California is the state with the strictest gun safety laws in the U.S. These include a ban on assault weapons, universal background checks and additional eligibility restrictions. California's gun death rate is the 44th lowest in the U.S. and is 37% lower than the country’s average.  State laws intended to curb gun proliferation are sometimes undermined by federal court case decisions, laws in neighboring states and national gun safety laws. Newsom tweeted ""the USA has a gun homicide rate 26 times higher than our peers."" His figure checks out with 2019 data for high-income nations and gun deaths measured by Everytown for Gun Safety. This number can shift based on what countries count as the U.S.’ ""peers,"", but Newsom’s main point stands. The statement is accurate but needs additional information",Mostly True,"January 25, 2023"
"In Milwaukee, ""The (homicide) rate has nearly doubled in the past two years.""","The November 2022 midterm elections saw plenty of issues take center stage, including Roe v. Wade, inflation and gasoline prices. But a major voter issue has not receded from the public consciousness — crime, or more specifically — homicides.   American cities, large and small, are grappling with how to stem the tide of violence as records are broken and families shattered. In Wisconsin, U.S. Rep. Bryan Steil, R-Janesville, zeroed in on the state’s largest city. ""Milwaukee is on pace for a third straight homicide record,"" Steil said in a Nov. 15 tweet. ""The rate has nearly doubled in the past two years. The men and women of law enforcement need our support to protect our communities from violent crime.""  It is well known that Milwaukee is on pace for a third straight year of record homicides. But we wondered about the second part: Has the rate really nearly doubled in the past two years? Let’s take a look. Milestone reached When asked to support the claim, Grace White, Steil’s communications director, pointed to Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reports, including a Nov. 23 article detailing how the city reached a grim milestone that week when a 33-year-old man was killed in a shooting on the 2900 block of North 46th Street, which marked the seventh homicide police reported in a nine-day period. That shooting brought Milwaukee’s preliminary homicide total to 197 for the year.  The Journal Sentinel’s homicide database is preliminary and figures can change as an investigation continues. If a fatality initially categorized as a homicide is later determined to be self-defense, for example, it would be removed from the homicide total. If a death is first categorized as an accident but investigation uncovers a deliberate killing, the tally would change then, too.  An example of the latter is an incident making national headlines involving a 10-year-old boy initially charged with first-degree reckless homicide as an adult in the Nov. 21 shooting death of his mother. On Dec. 8, prosecutors filed an alternative charge of first-degree intentional homicide against the boy.  The tragedy was initially reported to have been an accident, but according to a report in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, the boy’s relatives later contacted police questioning his story, and the child admitted he intentionally pointed a gun at his mother before shooting her, allegedly because she wouldn't allow him to buy an expensive virtual reality headset from Amazon.  Most, but not all, homicides are reported to the federal government as part of the FBI Uniform Crime Reporting system. The Milwaukee Police Department also maintains homicide statistics. So, each homicide database may see its figures adjusted upward or downward, depending on what emerges in an investigation.  A check of the Milwaukee Police Department’s Crime Maps & Statistics, showed homicides as of Dec. 7, were at 203. Those figures include five fatal shootings over the Dec.3-5 weekend in Milwaukee that claimed the lives of a 16-year-old boy, 17-year-old boy, 27-year-old man, a 36-year-old woman and a 50-year-old man. Homicides over two years White, of Steil’s office, cited the Journal Sentinel’s homicide database, which recorded Milwaukee homicides in 2019 at 111. In 2020, the number rose to 204. In 2021, the figure had climbed to 212 homicides. So, to have doubled in two years from 111 in 2019, the tally would have to have reached 222 in 2021.  So Steil’s ""nearly doubled"" claim is in the ballpark.  ""Data shows crime is surging in Wisconsin and across the nation,"" Steil said in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin. ""Soft on crime policies which include efforts to defund the police and eliminate cash bail allow criminals to remain on our streets and make our communities unsafe."" Steil cited several resources available to address the issue, including increasing training for law enforcement, hiring more officers, implementing stronger sentencing on repeat offenders and violent criminals and ending low/no bail policies by local prosecutors.  Behind the surge Experts have cited a variety of theories to explain the homicide rates, including fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic, unemployment, homelessness, drug violence and easy availability of guns.  Kenneth Streit, University of Wisconsin-Madison Law School Clinical associate professor, noted fluctuations in Milwaukee homicides go back decades. Streit said the average for Milwaukee County (slightly more than city) for 1984 to 1990 was 94 homicides, and ""this included the rapid escalation beginning in 1988 associated with drug trade. The average for the years 1991 to 1997 was 147, which included the peak year of 1991 (163).""    The University of Wisconsin professor pointed out that numbers and rates vary widely among large U.S. cities.  ""This has been the case for the last two decades,"" Streit said. ""Milwaukee is one of the few which not only had high rates (nearly exclusively related to African American victims) prior to 2020 and then having huge percentage increases above those rates which remain through 2022."" Streit explained the reductions of homicides during the 1990s are associated with federal drug laws that were supported — at that time —by Black elected officials.  ""To a large extent, those efforts may have been effective because many shootings at that time were related to large drug transactions,"" Streit said. ""Today's shootings do not appear to be primarily related to drugs.  Three decades after the peak of 1991, there are exponentially more guns readily available and shootings appear to be far more common for retaliation and settling disputes.""  Criminal defense attorney and Marquette Law School Adjunct Professor Craig Mastantuono said politician statements about defunding of police or eliminating cash bail are off-the-mark rhetoric, because neither has actually occurred.  ""The reality is that failure by our state legislature to provide Milwaukee with a fair portion of shared revenue or the ability to implement other revenue-raising measures have effectively frozen police funding,"" Mastantuono said.  Historically since pre-pandemic years, the Marquette adjunct professor said, homicides are currently on the rise, as are nonfatal shootings.  ""This is a national trend and a local trend,"" Mastantuono said. ""Since the homicide numbers were trending downward both nationally and locally for several years prior to 2020, it would be entirely illogical to ignore the COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on the country’s mental health as a whole. People who are violent or commit crimes are a microcosm of larger society, and we have all been witness to a general rise in crisis, stress, depression and anxiety in every quarter of our larger society."" Steil said In Milwaukee, ""the (homicide)  rate has nearly doubled in the past two years."" The Journal Sentinel’s homicide database recorded Milwaukee homicides in 2019 at 111. In 2020, the number rose to 204. In 2021, the figure climbed to 212 homicides. So Steil’s ""nearly doubled"" claim is on the mark",True,"December 9, 2022"
“They removed your ability to go buy firearms the day of election.”,"Following multiple false claims about voter disenfranchisement during the midterm elections, an Instagram video suggests that an Election Day computer glitch that briefly prevented people from buying guns was not a coincidence. The Nov. 8 video features a man addressing the camera while standing in a wooded area. He mentions ""voting irregularities"" in Arizona, New York and Pennsylvania before talking about a computer glitch involving firearm purchases.   ""The thing you should be most alarmed about and most worried about is the system that they use to do background checks so you can go purchase a firearm magically goes down on Election Day,"" he said. He later added, ""They removed your ability to go buy firearms the day of election."" He appears to be referring to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, NICS, which the FBI maintains.  ""Election machine problems. The Power Ball system goes down. And the system used for BACKGROUND checks has gone down with no idea when they will be back up and running,"" says the caption on the video. The Instagram post was flagged as part of Instagram’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram.) The FBI told PolitiFact one of the databases the background check system uses was unavailable for about an hour Nov. 8. The FBI said it was a technical issue; the agency did not specify which database was affected or what caused the glitch. The problem was then fixed and people could undergo background checks to purchase firearms on Election Day. The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act established the National Instant Criminal Background Check System in 1993 and required a person to undergo a federal background check when buying a firearm from a licensed gun seller.  The system draws on information from three databases maintained by the FBI to determine their eligibility for a gun: the Interstate Identification Index, which contains a national record of criminal convictions; the National Crime Information Center, with information on people with arrest warrants or protection orders filed against them; and the NICS Indices, which contain information from federal and state agencies about people barred from possessing guns for reasons such as mental incompetence.  If people appear in any of the three databases, the FBI recommends that sellers deny them a gun, the U.S. Department of Justice said.  The entire background check system did not malfunction on Election Day, but because one component wasn’t functioning,  the system was ""technically unable to provide a complete background check until all components were functional,"" the FBI said.  The outage didn’t keep people from buying guns for the entire day because of the midterms, as the video suggested. An Instagram video says, ""They removed your ability to go buy firearms the day of election."" One of three databases that comprise the National Instant Criminal Background Check System had unexpected technical problems on Election Day, causing the system to be unavailable for about an hour.

"“When you compare us to the European Union, we're something like 23 times more likely” to have homicides and handgun killings.","The day after six people died in a mass shooting at a Chesapeake, Virginia, Walmart, Del. Cliff Hayes Jr., D-Chesapeake, said the nation must discuss why it has so many ""homicides and handgun killings."" ""When you compare us here in this country to the European Union, we’re something like 23 times more likely for these incidents to occur here,"" he said during a Nov. 23 interview on CNN. We fact-checked Hayes’ statistic and found it’s essentially correct. He was referring to a May 2022 report published by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington.   The institute compared the 2019 homicide rates from firearms — not just handguns, as Hayes said — between countries across the globe. Among the findings is that the firearm homicide rate in the U.S. was 22 times larger than in the European Union as a whole. (The institute does not calculate worldwide homicides from handguns, and we were unable to find such figures). The U.S. firearm homicide rate in 2019 was 4.11 people per 100,000, compared with 0.19 in the 27-nation European Union. Bulgaria had the EU’s highest firearms homicide rate 0.56 per 100,000 — more than seven times lower than the U.S.  Romania had the EU’s lowest firearm homicide rate at 0.06 per 100,000 — 65 times lower than the U.S. Romanians are restricted to owning handguns manufactured before 1945, but can only collect and not carry them. Here are the firearm homicide rates of several other EU nations and how they compare with the United States, according to the institute: Italy: 0.35 per 100,000, 1/12th of the U.S. France: 0.32 per 100,000, 1/13th  of the U.S. Sweden: 0.25 per 100,000, 1/16th of the U.S, Spain: 0.13 per 100,000, 1/32nd of the U.S. Germany: 0.08 per 100,000, 1/51st of the U.S.  Although a number of statistical studies have focused on the high rate of firearm homicides in the U.S. compared to other countries, less research has been devoted to the reasons why, according to William A. Pridemore, a criminal justice professor at the State University of New York at Albany.  An obvious reason, Pridemore and many other academics say, is the high availability of firearms in the United States, where gun ownership is considered a constitutional right.  ""The U.S. is exceptional in per capita firearm ownership,"" Pridemore said. In 2017, there were 393.3 million firearms held by civilians in the U.S., according to a Small Arms Survey report by the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva, Switzerland. That broke down to about 1.2 guns per resident, the highest rate among 56 nations and territories surveyed. Yemen had the second highest rate at 0.53 guns per resident — less than half the rate of the U.S. ""No doubt we have other social factors that play a role in high gun homicide rates, but more guns and lax regulations are major contributors,"" said Daniel Webster, co-director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions. The National Rifle Association and other pro-gun advocates contend that firearms protect innocent people from harm and that more firearms would make the U.S. safer. We should note that Hayes’ statement also suggested that the overall homicide rate in the U.S. — from firearms and other methods — was about 23 times higher than the EU. The institute found that in 2019, 5.6 people per 100,000 were killed in the U.S. compared with 0.9 in the EU. In other words, the overall homicide rate in the U.S. was 6.2 times higher than the EU. Hayes said that when the U.S. is compared with the European Union, ""we're something like 23 times more likely"" to have homicides and handgun killings. The University of Washington research he cites shows the 2019 homicide rate from firearms — not just handguns as Hayes said — was 22 times higher in the U.S. than in the EU. The report did not contain worldwide homicide rates from handguns, and we have been unable to find that data.  Although there’s a slight error in Hayes’ language, his eye-popping gist about the preponderance of gun homicides in the U.S. compared with the EU holds up",Mostly True,"December 2, 2022"
“60% of counties in this country are refusing to implement the nation's gun laws.”,"The suspect in a mass shooting at a LGBTQ nightclub in Colorado Springs, Colorado, had previously made threats to use weapons, but local law enforcement did not pursue removing them under the state’s red flag law. Officials in El Paso County, which includes Colorado Springs, had lobbied against the state creating a red flag law, which lets people petition a civil court to temporarily remove another person’s firearms. The county in 2019 passed a resolution declaring themselves a ""Second Amendment preservation county"" and pledged not to spend money to ""initiate unconstitutional seizures.""  U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., a prominent supporter of federal gun restrictions, called out El Paso County and other places with these resolutions during an interview about the nightclub shooting on CNN. ""The majority of counties in this country have declared that they are not going to enforce state and federal gun laws,"" Murphy said Nov. 27 on CNN’s ""State of the Union."" ""They have decided that they are going to essentially refuse to implement laws that are on the books. That is a growing problem in this country. ….60 percent of counties in this country are refusing to implement the nation's gun laws."" We wanted to know more about these counties and fact-check whether Murphy’s statistic was accurate. The number refers to the percentage of counties that have sanctuary policies, and by that metric it checks out. There is no universally understood definition of a so-called Second Amendment sanctuary, said Allison Anderman, senior counsel at Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.  These broad policies about upholding the Second Amendment vary in each city, county or state. Some resolutions state that the jurisdiction won’t spend money to enforce what their officials deem unconstitutional gun laws.  Some experts have said these resolutions are merely symbolic. But there is some evidence that Second Amendment sanctuary areas use the state’s red flag laws less than other jurisdictions.  Gun rights supporters demonstrate Jan. 20, 2020, in front of the state Capitol in Richmond, Va. (AP) Nineteen states and Washington, D.C., have red flag laws. They are a relatively new phenomenon, with Connecticut passing the first such law in 1999. Colorado’s law, which went into effect in 2020, allows law enforcement, family or household members to file a petition asking a court to take away gun rights from a person who poses a significant risk to themselves or others. Despite polls showing strong support for these policies, The Associated Press found that laws faced a backlash by politicians who passed ""Second Amendment sanctuary"" policies in about 2,000 counties. That number reflects about 60% of the nation’s counties, and was the source for Murphy’s statistic.  We found one other source that backs up this figure from the website SanctuaryCounties.com, which compiles updates on these laws and says it is dedicated to ""law abiding, Constitution loving citizens who refuse to simply give up their Second Amendment rights."" The term ""sanctuary"" borrows from the sanctuary city policies that restrict state or local police from assisting federal immigration officers. Bryan Kibler, the former top prosecutor in Effingham County, Illinois, has been credited with devising the idea for Second Amendment sanctuaries. (Kibler is now a judge.) ""We wanted to ... get across that our Second Amendment rights are slowly being stripped away,"" Kibler told the AP in 2018.  Research suggests sanctuary counties employ red flag laws less often than counties without these resolutions. According to AP, 37 sanctuary counties in Colorado issued just 45 gun surrender orders over two years.  Researchers from the University of Colorado compared the use of the state’s red flag law in 2020 in counties with and without these policies. Of the 37 ""sanctuary"" counties, 24% had at least one petition filed, versus 48% of counties without these resolutions.  Second Amendment counties may create a chilling effect on filing petitions, they wrote, because people may incorrectly think the red flag laws are illegal. One of the researchers, Firearm Injury Prevention Initiative director Emmy Betz, said more study is needed. Her work covered a small sample and only one year of data.  ""There’s active research now trying to understand how resolutions (or other geographic differences) may influence police/prosecution prioritization, but I don’t think we have a firm answer on that question right now,"" Betz told PolitiFact. KUSA-TV, an NBC affiliate in Colorado, found that 53 petitions were filed in El Paso County, and judges approved 12 removal orders over the last nearly three years. The sheriff who opposed the state law filed no petitions. Shawn Fields, a law professor at Campbell University who wrote an article about sanctuaries for Northwestern University Law Review, cautioned that correlation does not necessarily equal causation.  ""Most (Second Amendment) sanctuary resolutions are merely symbolic in nature and have no enforcement mechanisms contained within them,"" Fields told PolitiFact. ""It is possible the existence of the resolutions are influencing police and prosecutor discretion in enforcing red flag laws. But it is equally possible that the resolutions themselves are merely reflections of a community already deeply skeptical about these types of firearms regulations, which may include police and prosecutors de-prioritizing their enforcement."" The newness of these sanctuary resolutions, combined with the pandemic’s potential effect on enforcement for a year and a half, means we have had very little time to assess the impact of these resolutions, Fields said.  In this July 9, 2019, file photo, Moms Demanding Action line up during a rally at the State Capitol in Richmond, Va. Gov. Ralph Northam called a special session of the General Assembly to consider gun legislation in light of the Virginia Beach shootings. (AP) We found other jurisdictions with sanctuary resolutions that still enforce gun laws. Virginia Beach City Council passed a resolution in 2020 declaring itself a ""Second Amendment Constitutional City."" Virginia Beach Sheriff Ken Stolle told PolitiFact that he strongly supports the Second Amendment but opposed the resolution. It wouldn’t affect law enforcement officials, he said, because they are guided by the U.S. Constitution, the Virginia Constitution and state laws.  ""Courts have the obligation of  interpreting the law, not the sheriff,"" said Stolle, a Republican, attorney and former state senator. ""My job is to enforce the law.""  In 2020, Virginia passed a red flag law. The Virginia Beach office of the commonwealth attorney told us that it has filed 27 red flag cases. And the police department regularly arrests people involved in gun crimes. Polk County, Florida, also passed a sanctuary resolution in 2020. Sheriff Grady Judd is one of the state’s most prominent Republican supporters of red flag laws. WINK News, a PolitiFact partner, found that Polk County has had more risk-protection orders, which red flag laws allow law enforcement to seek, than anywhere else in the state over the past four years — about 1,300. Some statewide resolutions suggest noncompliance with future laws.  ""The White House and U.S. Congress have announced their intention to pursue measures that would infringe on the right to keep and bear arms,"" reads Nebraska's Second Amendment sanctuary proclamation. ""Nebraska will stand up against federal overreach and attempts to regulate gun ownership."" How do these resolutions hold up legally? A county cannot refuse to enforce laws, and the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution requires that federal law take precedence over state and local law. Brady: United Against Gun Violence, which works to reduce gun violence, says courts have yet to take up a case that would answer whether the symbolic policies have any legal standing.  But the vast majority of sheriffs are independently elected, so they have autonomy to set and enforce policy, said political scientist Emily Farris of Texas Christian University. Farris helped oversee a survey of American sheriffs and found about 38% opposed a requirement to confiscate firearms from people who pose a public safety risk. Murphy said ""60 percent of counties in this country are refusing to implement the nation's gun laws."" Murphy’s statistic reflects an Associated Press analysis that found 2,000 counties have passed ""Second Amendment sanctuary"" policies pledging to not enforce some gun restrictions passed by their states. This represents about 60% of the nation’s 3,000 counties. But the resolutions do not necessarily mean that the jurisdiction doesn’t enforce gun laws — much less federal laws that take precedence over state and local laws. In some instances, counties with such resolutions are less likely to use the state’s red flag law. More research is warranted, experts say",Half True,"December 1, 2022"
The Club Q shooting was a “false flag.”,"News about the Nov. 19 mass shooting that killed five people at an LGBTQ nightclub in Colorado Springs, Colorado, is still developing, but that hasn’t stopped baseless social media claims from describing it as a ""false flag"" operation.  One tweet from a well-known purveyor of misinformation, Real Raw News, was posted a day after the shooting and claimed it was staged because of a perceived connection to the QAnon conspiracy theories.  ""Odd that the place was called Club ‘Q,’"" the tweet said. ""I smell False Flag."" There’s nothing fabricated about this shooting. The loved ones of five who authorities say were killed — Daniel Aston, 28, Kelly Loving, 40, Ashley Paugh, 35,  Derrick Rump, 38, and Raymond Green Vance, 22 —  are grieving. ""We're heartbroken. We're sad. We're mad, angry,"" Paugh’s sister, Stephanie Clark, told NBC. Club Q opened as a gay club in Colorado Springs in the early 2000s, well before QAnon first emerged as a conspiracy theory in 2017. Coverage of the club’s opening by local newspaper The Gazette focused on the club owners’ aim to serve the queer community at a time when mainstream media was increasingly embracing LGBTQ culture amid popular shows like ""Queer Eye for the Straight Guy"" and ""Will & Grace.""

There is no evidence the club is linked to QAnon. False flag operations historically referred to when a military force or ship flew the flag of another country to deceive an enemy. The term then became associated with governments faking violent acts to justify military action against an enemy. Today, actual false flags are outnumbered by modern-day conspiracy theories that use the term to baselessly suggest fraud whenever a tragedy or violent attack occurs. The false accusations frequently follow mass shootings: 26 killed at Sandy Hook Elementary, in 2012; 17 killed by a gunman in a Parkland, Florida, high school in 2018; 31 dead in El Paso, Texas, and Dayon, Ohio, in 2019.  Similar false flag claims followed more recent shootings in Buffalo, New York; Highland Park, Illinois; and Uvalde County, Texas, all receiving Pants on Fire ratings from PolitiFact. Conspiracy theorists have also called the 9/11 attacks and the recent attack on Paul Pelosi false flag operations.  While the Colorado Springs shooting remains under investigation by law enforcement and a motive for it has not been disclosed, there is no evidence to support the idea it was all staged. Multiple local and national news outlets have closely covered the shooting and interviewed law enforcement personnel and witnesses at the nightclub, as well as reviewed 911 calls from that night.  The Denver Post reported that the first call to 911 happened around 11:57 a.m. Police believe the gunman began shooting as soon as he entered the building. Joshua Thurman, who was at the club, told the Post he initially mistook the gunfire as a part of the music before realizing something was wrong. ""There were bodies on the ground … shattered glass, blood. It was awful,"" Thurman told the paper. At least two clubgoers confronted the suspected gunman within minutes of the first shots fired and subdued him before police arrived just after midnight, the Denver Post reported. Anderson Lee Aldrich, 22, was identified by police as the suspect. Aldrich faces 10 counts of first-degree murder and hate crime charges, according to court records reviewed by CNN. The Colorado Springs Police Department said multiple guns were found at the nightclub, including a ""long rifle"" used during the shooting. A social media post made the baseless claim the mass shooting at an LGBTQ nightclub in Colorado Springs was a false flag operation.  The post implied the shooting was staged and pointed to a perceived connection to the QAnon conspiracy theorists because the club is named Club Q.  The club has no connection to QAnon. It was opened more than a decade before QAnon emerged as a conspiracy theory. Overwhelming evidence from continuous news coverage, police statements and witness testimonies prove the shooting happened.

“Kari Lake is opposed to red flag laws.”,"A new bipartisan federal firearms law, the Safer Communities Act, includes a provision that provides money for states to implement so-called red flag laws.  These laws allow family members or law enforcement to petition a court to temporarily take firearms away from a person who poses a threat to themselves or others. An ad from the gun control advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety said that Republican Arizona gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake would not implement red flag laws. ""Kari Lake is opposed to red flag laws that would stop mass shootings,"" said the Oct. 10 ad.  We can’t check whether such laws would prevent mass shootings, but we can check her stance on this issue. Lake is against this legislation. Red flag laws are meant to remove weapons from dangerous people before a crime or tragedy occurs — hence the phrase ""red flag.""  The process allows people to petition a civil court to temporarily remove that person’s firearms. Red flag laws are sometimes called extreme risk protection orders (shorthanded as ERPOs); gun violence restraining orders; or state crisis intervention orders.  The 2018 mass shooter at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, for example, was the subject of two tips to the FBI about his plans and of multiple 911 calls about his behavior for years before the shooting. Each state’s law sets rules for who can start the petition process. Most petitions are filed by law enforcement, and courts usually grant them. Once the court receives a petition, judges must follow their state law that explains what criteria a judge must or could consider. If the threat of harm is imminent, courts can issue an emergency order without a hearing, ordering the removal of people’s guns. But those orders last only a few days to three weeks. Before issuing a final order, a court holds a hearing at which the people can testify on their own behalf or bring a lawyer.  In most states, the maximum length of a final order is one year. There are red flag laws in 19 states, plus the District of Columbia. Arizona, with relatively few firearm restrictions, has no such law. A provision on extreme risk protection orders was part of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act that Congress passed in June. The law provides $750 million over five years for states to use for several kinds of crisis intervention programs, with red flag laws being one option. If states choose, they can use the money to implement a red flag law, so long as they follow federal rules to protect the due process rights of people who have their firearms taken away.  Lake has consistently opposed red flag laws. In a Sept. 21, 2021, interview with GunFreedomRadio, she said she saw no need for them. She later tweeted the same point. ""The entire Country should be a sanctuary for the Second Amendment,"" Lake tweeted Sept. 24, 2021, ""No red flag Laws. N magazine capacity bans. No ‘Gun-Free’ Zones. Shall. Not. Be. Infringed."" Lake repeated that position this summer. ""I think I can speak for most moms in America: you can shove your ‘red flag laws’ where the sun don’t shine,"" she tweeted June 16. ""I dare you to try and throw us on lists and come after our firearms."" Everytown for Gun Safety pointed to Lake’s tweets as evidence for its claim. We reached out to the Lake campaign and did not hear back. Everytown for Gun Safety said that ""Kari Lake is opposed to red flag laws."" Lake has said publicly several times that she does not support red flag laws",True,"November 8, 2022"
"""Raphael Warnock and Stacey Abrams are radical communists and, if they get their way, gun owners here in Georgia will be completely disarmed.""","The top two Democrats on Georgia’s election ticket are communists and gun confiscators, according to an attack ad released by a gun rights group in the final days before the Nov. 8 midterms. Georgia Gun Owners’ ad running on both Facebook and Instagram is directed at U.S. Sen. Raphael Warnock and gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams. ""Raphael Warnock and Stacey Abrams are radical communists and, if they get their way, gun owners here in Georgia will be completely disarmed!""  the ad’s caption said. ""That’s what they want, to turn our beloved Georgia, and America, into the next China — where only the government has guns."" It features the Georgia Gun Owners’ leader, Aaron Dorr, reiterating the attacks on the Abrams and Warnock and on President Joe Biden. Dorr says they are communists who hate America and ""want to turn it into the next China."" The ad makes a false claim without evidence. Warnock and Abrams have not espoused communist policies or called for blanket seizures of guns. Warnock, who won a special election in January 2021, is being challenged by former college and professional football player Herschel Walker, a Republican. The toss-up race could help decide which party controls the Senate, which is split 50-50. Abrams is running against first-term GOP Gov. Brian Kemp; she narrowly lost to him in 2018. Georgia Gun Owners did not respond to our messages requesting evidence for the ad’s claims. Communism typically involves authoritarian rule, a one-party government that owns all property and controls the means of production, and advocates for ending capitalism. Warnock and Abrams have not espoused such policies. ""Many on the right use the word communist as a catchall epithet to describe pretty much any liberal policy or person,"" said Jeffrey Lazarus, political science professor at Georgia State University. ""Neither Warnock nor Abrams has said anything remotely close to advocating for a public takeover of significant sectors of the economy. The idea doesn’t have any sort of cachet in mainstream Democratic circles.""  Warnock’s campaign pointed to news reports that identified him as a capitalist after he was attacked as a Marxist during his first Senate campaign. Abrams’ campaign denied that she is a communist. ""While various policies espoused by Abrams and Warnock might be labeled liberal or progressive, especially compared to previous statewide candidates in Georgia, there is nothing they are promoting that comes anywhere near being labeled communist,"" said Thomas Hunter, a political scientist at the University of West Georgia. ""It is ludicrous to call them ‘radical communists.’"" Warnock and Abrams have not called for widespread gun confiscation. Hunter said that although Abrams and Warnock favor gun control, ""neither has come anywhere near calling for the widespread confiscation of weapons."" Warnock is endorsed by the Giffords anti-gun violence group, which praised his support of legislation to restrict firearm access for people who have committed domestic abuse and to require background checks on all gun sales. The National Rifle Association has criticized Warnock’s support of legislation that would ban semiautomatic weapons such as AR-15-style rifles.  Warnock’s campaign website does not address guns and he has been less outspoken than Abrams about gun control. His campaign said Warnock has supported ""common-sense"" gun control efforts, not taking away guns. Abrams told Axios in June that she would pursue ""the obvious and the common-sense gun safety rules that do not infringe upon anyone's ability to carry."" She supports limiting access to guns for domestic violence perpetrators and stalkers, and enabling people and law enforcement officials to petition courts to temporarily restrict gun access for people who have mental health problems that threaten themselves or others. The NRA has criticized Abrams’ stance, claiming her restrictions ""would strip Second Amendment rights of law-abiding Americans without due process.""  Giffords endorsed Abrams. None of Abrams’ gun-control proposals ""would lead to law-abiding gun owners being 'completely disarmed’,"" campaign spokesperson Alex Floyd said. Georgia Gun Owners claimed that Warnock and Abrams are ""radical communists and, if they get their way, gun owners here in Georgia will be completely disarmed."" The two Georgia Democrats have not advocated communist policies, such as complete government ownership of property. They also have not called for the widespread confiscation of guns from all people in Georgia. The claim is inaccurate and distorts reality",False Pants on Fire,"November 3, 2022"
"Says Gov. Tony Evers would, “allow the government to use red flag laws to confiscate your firearms without due process.”","In the race for governor, a radio ad from the National Rifle Association offers a laundry list of complaints against Democratic Gov. Tony Evers' stance on guns, citing self-defense issues, ""California-style"" firearm bans and magazine bans.  But we wanted to focus on one claim in particular: That Evers ""would even allow the government to use red-flag laws to confiscate your firearms without due process."" Red flag laws, sometimes referred to as extreme risk protection orders, are in place in 19 states and Washington, D.C. These laws allow the government to temporarily take away guns of people who show evidence of having the potential to harm themselves or others.  But does Evers support such a law? And would it, as the NRA claims, allow guns to be ""confiscated"" without due process? Let’s take a look. In July, President Joe Biden signed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which includes monetary incentives for states to pass red flag laws.  Such laws provide a mechanism to take guns from people exhibiting dangerous behavior before they harm themselves or others, as we noted in a 2019 item. The first such law was passed in Connecticut in 1990, but the second didn’t appear until Indiana’s in 2005. Many states enacted such laws after mass shootings at schools across the country. For example, in 2018, 14 states enacted them after a gunman opened fire at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, killing 17. Although the process varies from state to state, the laws typically allow someone (usually a law enforcement officer or close family member) to petition a judge to temporarily take away someone’s firearms because of a potential threat they may present to themselves or others. But some states allow for doctors, co-workers or school officials to petition as well. Evers clearly supports such laws. In 2019, he called a special session of the Legislature to try to force Republicans to take up such a measure for Wisconsin. But GOP lawmakers gaveled in and out of the session without any action. For his part, GOP gubernatorial candidate Tim Michels has been against such laws.  ""People are entitled to due process,"" Michels said in a July 18 interview on the Vicki McKenna show. ""You just can’t have someone make a complaint against you and your … Second Amendment right be taken away."" When asked for backup for the claim, an NRA spokesperson said that red flag laws are issued ex-parte, meaning that a gun owner would have little to no notice if their gun was potentially being taken away.  Hence, the part of the claim that a gun would be taken ""without due process."" This reminded us of a similar claim Assembly Speaker Robin Vos made in 2019 in response to Evers’ move to force a vote on introducing red flag laws in Wisconsin.  We rated Mostly False a Vos claim that ""red flag laws"" allow gun seizure without a judge’s involvement: ""They take it away first. Then you have to get permission from a judge to do it."" In that item, we noted: These (red flag) orders are temporary and last from two to 21 days depending on the state, according to an issue brief put together by the nonpartisan Wisconsin Legislative Council. Gun owners then have a chance to make their cases at a hearing before a judge decides on a final order. That order commonly lasts for a year. So, the NRA’s description of this as ""confiscation"" is over the top, in that the statement can be understood as one never gets guns back. What’s more, it ignores just what Evers was advocating. Back to our 2019 item: Evers’ proposed red flag law for Wisconsin requires a hearing within 14 days of the preliminary order, and makes a final order valid for a year. It says guns should be seized if the judge finds ""reasonable grounds that the respondent is substantially likely"" to harm themselves or others. Requests can be made to extend the final order or end it early. State law already requires guns be surrendered as a result of other judicial findings, such as mental health commitments and restraining orders, according to the Legislative Council. Finally: The Wisconsin proposal — contrary to Vos’ description — doesn’t allow any guns to be seized without a judicial order. So, under the proposal Evers backed, a judge was involved from the beginning. And, as the item noted, such laws in other states have been upheld as constitutional on both Second Amendment and due process grounds. That includes a ruling upholding the Florida law in September 2019. The NRA has a point in that the gun owner is not involved from the beginning, but the way it states the claim goes too far — especially given the fact other such laws have been upheld. The NRA claimed that Evers would, ""use red-flag laws to confiscate Wisconsinite firearms without due process."" Like Vos on an earlier claim, the NRA vastly overstates the way red-flag laws work, suggesting there is no judicial process at all. In truth, the proposal backed by Evers had a judge involved from the start, unlike in some other states. The NRA also used over-the-top language in describing a temporary seizure through a clear judicial process as ""confiscation."" The NRA has a point that the gun owner is not necessarily involved in the initial hearing, but that alone — as other courts have held — does not mean it violates due process",Mostly False,"October 31, 2022"
"Says Tim Michels ""opposes closing the loophole that allows domestic abusers to buy guns.""","In Wisconsin’s race for governor, each candidate (and their supporters) have been portraying the other as too radical to lead the state. That includes the A Better Wisconsin Together Political Fund, which in a campaign ad slams Republican challenger Tim Michels on what it terms a gun law ""loophole."" ""There’s a dangerous loophole that lets some domestic abusers buy guns,"" intones the voiceover in the 15-second ad, which was launched online Sept. 12. ""Politicians in both parties are trying to close the loophole. You know who said they won’t? Radical Tim Michels.""  Michels, of course, is in a hotly contested battle against Democratic Gov. Tony Evers, who is seeking a second term in the Nov. 8 election.  The claim comes in the wake of a May 2022 ruling by the state Supreme Court in a case from Brown County. In its ruling, the court unanimously reversed a circuit judge's ruling that a man's conviction for disorderly conduct counted as a domestic violence misdemeanor under federal law, which would then prohibit gun possession. The state high court found that, although the offense was domestic and violent, it's not the facts that matter, but the nature of Wisconsin’s disorderly conduct statute. That law allows conviction for a variety of actions, but since violence is not a required element, it doesn't match the federal definition. Attorney General Josh Kaul, a Democrat whose office argued the case to the court, said at the time, ""This decision means that more perpetrators of domestic violence will be able to possess firearms and get concealed carry licenses."" So, is the group right about Michels’ position? A Better Wisconsin Together describes itself as a state-based research and communications hub for progressives. When we asked for backup to the claim, a spokesperson pointed us to a 52-second video clip of Michels posted online by state Democrats from an Aug. 1 town hall meeting before the Republican primary.  We went back to the full hourlong debate, posted on YouTube by forum sponsor WISN-TV, Channel 12, to see it all in context. Michels was responding to a question from an audience member who was described as an advocate for victims of domestic violence and sexual assault.  The question: ""What’s your plan for reducing and/or eliminating the repeat acts of gun violence from those who have minor convictions and are still able to possess and/or purchase firearms in the state of Wisconsin?""  The answer from Michels: ""Yeah, so like I said, guns haven’t changed, society has changed. And I want to make sure that law abiding gun owners aren’t having their guns confiscated because an angry ex, ex-spouse, makes a complaint. ‘Oh, he made a threat to me and then the police have to go confiscate his guns.’ The Second Amendment is constitutional. It’s a right given by the Constitution to bear arms, and I will support the Second Amendment. I believe what we have to do is enforce the gun laws that are on the books."" The Michels team did not respond to our request for comment by deadline. However, we found Michels has been quite clear on where he stands on the issue. Michels was a guest July 18 on the ""Vicki McKenna Show"" on iHeart Radio. Here is the relevant portion of the conversation: McKenna: Would you promise — the Biden administration, along with some Republican support, just passed a piece of gun control legislation that is going to try to entice states to adopt red flag laws? Would you — in exchange for dollars from the federal government. Would you pledge not to take that money, and not to encourage the Republican Assembly and Senate to pass red flag laws? Michels: The federal government wants to attach dollars to some agenda that they have, and we won’t take it if I don’t agree with it. … I own a lot of guns and I know how to use them properly. Red flag laws, you know, people are entitled to due process. You just can’t have somebody make a complaint against you, and … your Second Amendment right be taken away. Now, that won’t happen here in Wisconsin, when I’m governor. Under red flag laws, of course, typically police or family members are able to ask a court to force someone suspected of being a danger to himself or others to give up their firearms temporarily. Only 19 states and the District of Columbia have such laws, according to the Giffords Center, but recent federal legislation provided money to encourage states to establish such programs.  Many states enacted such laws after mass shootings at schools. For example, in 2018, 14 states enacted them after a gunman opened fire at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, killing 17 people. Republicans have balked at a push by Evers to put such a system in place in Wisconsin. For example, in November 2019, Evers called a special legislative session to take up two bills to expand background checks on firearm sales and implement a new red flag law. GOP leaders opened and closed the session within seconds, taking no action. The A Better Wisconsin Together Political Fund said Tim Michels ""opposes closing the loophole that allows domestic abusers to buy guns."" During a Republican primary forum, Michels noted: ""I want to make sure that law-abiding gun owners aren’t having their guns confiscated because an angry ex, ex-spouse, makes a complaint."" And in a radio interview, he said ""You just can’t have somebody make a complaint against you, and… your Second Amendment right be taken away.

Kathy Hochul claimed that shootings in New York State are falling faster than in the rest of the country. Hochul, a Democrat, is running for re-election against Republican U.S. Rep. Lee Zeldin, who has accused her of being soft on crime. In a speech about public safety, she said that compared to last year, shootings are down.  ""Shootings across the state of New York are down 10% from one year ago,"" she said. ""And we're outpacing the rest of the country — as you know, this is a national phenomenon, the gun violence, national phenomenon — we are outpacing the country, where on average across America, the drop is only 2%."" We wondered whether this comparison is correct, and whether New York outpaces the rest of the country.  We approached the New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services for the source of Hochul’s claim.  The first part of the claim, that shootings dropped 10%, comes from the state’s Division of Criminal Justice Services. The agency collects data about shootings from 20 major police departments across upstate and Long Island: Albany, Binghamton, Buffalo, Hempstead, Jamestown, Kingston, Middletown, Mt. Vernon, Nassau County, Niagara Falls, Newburgh, Poughkeepsie, Rochester, Schenectady, Spring Valley, Suffolk County, Syracuse, Troy, Utica and Yonkers. Notably, New York City is not on the list. Between Jan. 1 and Aug. 31, 2022, and the same period in 2021, shooting incidents in which at least one person was injured or killed dropped 10%, according to the report, known as the Gun Involved Violence Elimination Initiative, or GIVE. The report showed 840 such incidents in 2021 and 756 incidents in 2022. The number of people injured or killed in these incidents decreased by 10.8%, but the number of people who died in gun violence incidents grew by 4.1%.  The report also found a 25.6% increase in shootings involving injuries or deaths in 2022 compared with the average of the previous five years, 2017 to 2021.   We asked Christopher Herrmann, an assistant professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, about Hochul’s claim. He called the state’s report on shootings a reliable source. Herrmann, who previously analyzed statistics for the New York City Police Department, said shootings are also down in New York City, where shootings fell 12.6% in the first nine months of 2022 compared with the same period in 2021. The number of shootings there have continued to fall.   The second part of the governor's claim, that shootings are down 2% nationwide, comes from a New York Times newsletter,  according to Janine Kava, director of public information for the Division of Criminal Justice Services. The newsletter on Sept. 23 reported a 2% decrease in shootings, and it linked to the Gun Violence Archive, a national database of shooting incidents. The Gun Violence Archive, a nonprofit, collects data on shootings from more than 7,500 sources, including police departments and local news outlets. Its searchable database has information on each shooting with details such as where the incident happened and how many people were injured or died.  We spoke with the archive’s executive director, Mark Bryant, who said that Hochul’s claim of a 2% drop in shootings across the country is correct.  ""Everything we’ve seen this year lines up to about 2%,"" Bryant said.  He noted that New York City has seen fewer shootings, despite some headline-grabbing crimes.  But he warned against comparing results from two different data sets that contain different types of data.   For example, the Gun Violence Archive tracks all incidents involving a gun, but the state’s GIVE report does not. Murder-suicides with a firearm are included in the state’s report, but suicides, officer-involved shootings and accidental shootings are not. The Gun Violence Archive includes all of these categories. However, anyone searching the database can filter them out.  The GIVE report includes busy police departments upstate and on Long Island but does not include all departments, while the Gun Violence Archive records shooting data regardless of jurisdiction.  We searched the Gun Violence Archive for all incidents in which at least one person was injured or died in a shooting, and we found the decrease in these incidents in New York State between Jan. 1 and Aug. 31, 2021, and the same period in 2022, was 3.8%, not 10%. Our search included accidental deaths and suicides, which were likely outside the purview of Hochul’s remarks, made during a speech to law enforcement.   When accidental deaths, suicides, and officer-involved shootings are removed from the Gun Violence Archive search results for New York State, the decline in shootings between Jan. 1 and Aug. 31, 2021, and the same period in 2022, is 3%.  We approached the Hochul administration with the search results from the Gun Violence Archive and our finding that New York State’s decline in shootings compared to the decline in the rest of the country is much narrower than Hochul makes it seem in her statement.  In the absence of a nationwide, federal database that uses consistent definitions for reporting gun violence, the state used the Gun Violence Archive data cited by The New York Times to provide perspective on the issue, as the increase in gun violence since 2020 has not been limited to New York State, said Kava, a spokesperson for the state’s Division of Criminal Justice Services.  The administration noted New York City’s decline in shootings, 13.6% as of Oct. 16, and sent data from three other big cities, year-over-year, where shootings have fallen slightly or not at all.  The decline in shooting victims is 2% in Los Angeles. Shootings increased elsewhere, by 2.3% in Baltimore and by 1.34% in Philadelphia.    The administration stands by the data Hochul cited, Kava said.   Hochul claimed New York State is doing better than the rest of the country in the number of shootings, saying they dropped 10% in New York and 2% in the rest of the country.  A state report of 20 police agencies does show a 10% drop in shooting incidents.  A different database shows a 2% drop in shootings across the country.  But comparing these results can be misleading, because they don’t contain all of the same types of shooting incidents, and the state report includes only some geographic areas.  Independent of each other, Hochul cited reliable statistics. In New York, shootings appear to be down more than in the rest of the country, though it’s not clear by how much. Comparing New York with the rest of the country, as she did, mixes data sources and can give a misleading impression about where New York stands. The Gun Violence Archive, the source for her claim of a 2% drop across the country, shows a much smaller drop in New York state during the same period — a 3% or a 3.8% drop, depending on which types of shootings are counted",Half True,"October 24, 2022"
There were two shooters in the 2017 Las Vegas mass shooting.,"About three years ago, on Oct. 1, 2017, Stephen Paddock shot into a country music concert crowd on the Las Vegas Strip from a Mandalay Bay hotel room, killing 60 people and injuring hundreds more.  Joe Lombardo, the sheriff of Clark County, where Las Vegas is the county seat, and the Republican gubernatorial candidate in Nevada, has said that the shooter acted alone. So did the state’s top FBI official. And yet, conspiracy theories continue to spread online that there was another shooter.  One recent Instagram post wrongly claims the government orchestrated the shooting, and includes an old blog post claiming that ""close up video shows 2nd shooter firing out of the lower-level window at Mandalay Bay in Vegas."" The post also has a video from the vantage point of a cab on the Las Vegas Strip. Gunshots can be heard and flashing lights from what appear to be floors below the 32nd floor, where police said Paddock was positioned.  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram.) The blog post in the Instagram post is no longer online.   Las Vegas police and the FBI investigated the shooting for 10 months, and when authorities released their final report in August 2018, Lombardo said the investigation revealed there were ""no other gunmen"" and that Paddock acted alone. He is the sole suspect listed in the investigative report, ""Despite early reports of multiple shooters in different locations, no evidence exists to substantiate any of those reports,"" the report says. ""Thousands of hours of digital media were reviewed, and after all the interviews were conducted, no evidence exists to indicate Paddock conspired with or acted in collusion with anyone else. This includes video surveillance, recovered DNA and analysis of cellular phones, and computers belonging to Paddock.""   As The New York Times noted in its 2017 debunk of claims that there were multiple shooters, the footage in the Instagram post doesn’t prove the hypothesis.  ""The light and the gunshot sounds do not match"" in that video and another that circulated at the time,"" the Times said. ""And further, footage taken before and after the shooting shows that the light consistently flashed through the night.""   The light’s visible in this video posted on Instagram that was taken during a performance by country music duo Big and Rich, two hours before the shooting started",False,"October 20, 2022"
"A video shows an actor “getting into character before his press interview less than 24 hours after the supposed killing of his 6-year-old daughter.""","On Oct. 12, a Connecticut jury ordered conspiracy theorist Alex Jones to pay $965 million to the family members of victims in the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting and an FBI agent — people who said they were targeted and traumatized by Jones’ lie that the 2012 shooting was a hoax.  Among the relatives of victims who Jones falsely claimed were actors hired as a plot to seize Americans’ guns: Robbie Parker, whose 6-year-old daughter, Emilie, was killed. A recent Instagram post echoes this claim.  ""Never forget the main character #RobbieParker in the [email protected] Ho0k hoax getting into character before his press interview less than 24hrs after the supposed killing of his 6 year old daughter,"" the Oct. 15 post said. (It’s possible that the misspelled reference to the school was intentional to avoid moderation.) It featured a CNN clip of Parker speaking the day after the Dec. 14, 2012, shooting.

""He seized upon something Parker did — a brief laugh at a remark by his father as he faced an unexpectedly large throng of journalists — to advance the falsehood that the shooting was staged."" But Parker laughed, not because he was an actor getting to character, but because he was nervous and didn’t know how to start talking to reporters, the Post said.

"""To call what happened on January 6 an armed insurrection, I just think is not accurate.""","The U.S. House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, has scheduled what could be its final public hearing for Oct. 13.  It will be the committee’s first public session since the summer, when lawmakers presented the evidence they gathered in a series of televised hearings that attracted millions of viewers. A report is to be filed by the end of the year. The earlier hearings, and the criminal charges brought against more than 900 protesters by the U.S. Justice Department, have made clear that the events of that day were part of a coordinated effort to prevent the lawful transfer of power to newly elected President Joe Biden. An insurrection. The hearings have included video footage and photos of the attack, showing participants erecting gallows, deploying pepper spray, hurling a fire extinguisher, using baseball bats to smash windows and throwing flags like spears at police officers. Within a week of the attack, a dozen guns and thousands of rounds of ammunition were found. In other words, the crowd was armed. Both points seem clear. Not to U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., who is locked in a tight re-election race against Democrat Mandela Barnes, Wisconsin’s lieutenant governor. Here was Johnson during an Oct. 4 appearance at the Rotary Club of Milwaukee as reported by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: ""Now some of the protesters did teach us all how you can use flagpoles and that kind of stuff as weapons. But to call what happened on January 6 an armed insurrection, I just think is not accurate."" On that, he is plainly wrong. Repeating a ridiculous claim This is not the first time Johnson has made such a claim. On Feb. 15, 2021, we looked at a similar claim from Johnson, who in an appearance on ""The Jay Weber Show"" on WISN radio said accounts of the Jan. 6, 2021, events were being exaggerated.  ""The fact of the matter is this didn’t seem like an armed insurrection to me. I mean armed, when you hear armed, don’t you think of firearms?"" Johnson said. ""Here’s the questions I would have liked to ask. How many firearms were confiscated? How many shots were fired? I’m only aware of one, and I’ll defend that law enforcement officer for taking that shot."" Johnson made a nearly identical claim later that morning on ""The Regular Joe Show."" At the time, we noted the definition of ""armed"" is broader than Johnson makes it out to be. Carrying a gun, of course, is armed. But so is carrying other weapons.  When we checked the claim, just over a month after Jan. 6, NBC News had already reported that within a week after the attack a dozen guns and thousands of rounds of ammunition had been found on seven people arrested before and after the Capitol riot. The New York Times had reviewed video that showed people using stolen police shields, sticks and crutches as weapons. A man photographed with his feet on the desk of U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., was carrying a 950,000-volt stun gun walking stick. In addition, reports said pipe bombs were found near the Capitol at Republican and Democratic party headquarters. We called the claim ""ridiculous revisionist history"" and rated it Pants on Fire.  When asked for backup to the claim, Johnson’s spokesperson Alexa Henning in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin said ""this started with a deceptively edited video tweet from an NBC reporter"" and that the senator was referring to how weapons were characterized in the 2020 riots that rocked many cities following the police killing of George Floyd versus what happened on Jan. 6, 2021.  ""He is in no way condoning this action,"" she said. ""He’s commenting on the hypocrisy of the situation."" A video of the question and answer shows that was the framing of his response, but Johnson’s complaints about media coverage don’t change what he said or how he has continued to characterize the Jan. 6 events – as not an armed insurrection. Since we last examined this claim, the picture has only become clearer. Few arrests were made on Jan. 6, 2021, but more than 900 people have now been identified and charged, according to a database maintained by National Public Radio. The database contained the names of 908 people charged when last updated Oct. 10. Law enforcement has arrested alleged rioters in nearly all 50 states, as well as the District of Columbia. Charges include unlawful possession of a firearm, unlawful entry, assaulting, resisting or impeding officers, civil disorder, disorderly conduct, destruction of government property and violent entry in a Capitol Building.  ""The Justice Department put the cases into three categories: those who conspired over days, weeks and even months to attack the Capitol; those who allegedly violently attacked police, often with the use of weapons;  and the remainder who breached the building as part of the mob, but did not commit other crimes,"" NPR reported. ""Sixty defendants have been charged with conspiracy. At least 228 defendants have been charged with violence."" At least $2.5 million of damage was done to the Capitol. As NPR also reported:  ""About 140 law enforcement officers suffered injuries in the attack,  many at the hands of rioters wielding pepper spray, metal pipes and American flags fashioned into clubs.""  Four people in the crowd died Jan. 6, 2021, including U.S. Air Force veteran Ashli Babbitt, who was shot to death by Capitol Police as the crowd tried to breach the House chamber. In the days and weeks after the insurrection, additional people died, according to The New York Times, including five law enforcement officers, one of whom, Brian D. Sicknick, had been attacked by the mob and died Jan. 7, 2021.  On Oct. 6, Jeremy Bertino, 43, of Belmont, North Carolina, a former Proud Boys lieutenant, pleaded guilty to seditious conspiracy and has agreed to cooperate with the Justice Department against the group’s former chairman Henry ""Enrique"" Tarrio and four other Proud Boys leaders. They are scheduled for trial in December.  According to The Washington Post, the Proud Boys members are accused of ""plotting to oppose by force the presidential transition, culminating in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol."" In addition to the conspiracy charge, according to The Washington Post, Bertino also pleaded guilty to a charge of illegal possession of firearms as a former felon. Bertino faces up to 20 years in prison for seditious conspiracy and up to 10 years in prison for the firearms charge, the Justice Department said. No sentencing date was set.  Meanwhile, several leaders of the far-right militia group Oath Keepers are currently on trial for seditious conspiracy, a rarely used Civil War era offense, in the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection. Johnson said ""To call what happened on January 6 an armed insurrection, I just think is not accurate."" It’s Johnson’s claim — that it was not an armed insurrection — that is inaccurate. There was plenty of evidence to rebut that claim when Johnson made it in the immediate aftermath of Jan. 6, 2021. There is plenty more now. It’s still false and ridiculous",False Pants on Fire,"October 10, 2022"
Pennsylvania Senate candidate John Fetterman’s tattoo references ‘heroin use’ and the Crips,"Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich claimed in a recent Fox News segment that Pennsylvania Senate candidate John Fetterman’s tattoos are references to heroin use and violent gangs. Fetterman is the lieutenant governor of the commonwealth and the Democratic nominee for U.S. Senate. He will face off against Republican challenger Dr. Mehmet Oz next month. ""He apparently had a tattoo that was either a reference to a song in favor of heroin use or was a tribute to the Crips,"" the Republican and former House speaker said Sept. 29 on ""Hannity,"" referring to the Los Angeles-based street gang. Gingrich floated a similar claim days prior on Twitter, writing ""Is Pennsylvania Democrat Fetterman’s tattoo ‘I will make you hurt’ based on his ties to the crips gang as reported by the Free Beacon or a reference to the nine inch nails heroin song ‘Hurt’. Fetterman won’t answer questions."" Is Pennsylvania Democrat Fetterman’s tattoo “I will make you hurt” based on his ties to the crips gang as reported by the Free Beacon or a reference to the nine inch nails heroin song “Hurt”. Fetterman won’t answer questions. We reached out to Gingrich to find out what he was basing his information on, but didn’t hear back. We found a Sept. 26 Washington Free-Beacon article that sought to draw a connection between Fetterman and the Crips gang, but the article didn’t mention tattoos.   Fetterman, meanwhile, has answered questions about his tattoos. Fetterman talked about them for a 2008 story in the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review and a 2009 story in Rolling Stone, when he was mayor of Braddock, a Pittsburgh suburb. He wrote about them in a 2021 blog post. And in a Sept. 25 op-ed published by NBC News, Fetterman addressed the claims directly after another Fox News host, Tucker Carlson, also zeroed in on the candidate’s ink. Fetterman’s right arm shows a series of numeric dates. Each memorializes someone from Braddock who was a victim of violent crime, Fetterman has said.

""This isn't a vanity thing for me,"" Fetterman told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review in the 2008 piece. ""It's a personal inventory that allows a way for me to properly document these people who have been felled by violence."" There are nine dates on his arm, he wrote in the NBC op-ed: ""Each one is a day on which someone died violently in Braddock, Pennsylvania, while I was mayor."" His left arm, meanwhile, shows the numbers ""15104."" That’s the ZIP code for Braddock. ""I get that etching art permanently onto your body isn’t how most politicians would express their connection to their communities,"" Fetterman wrote. ""But I didn’t care about what anyone else thought. It felt right to me."" Fetterman used to have the words ""I will make you hurt"" tattooed on his outside right wrist. That’s a lyric from the 1994 song ""Hurt"" written and performed by Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails and covered in 2002 by Johnny Cash on his final album. The Grammy-nominated song is written from the perspective of a person in a moment of deep sadness and regret and includes a line about needle use and its failure to erase painful memories.

In a 2009 interview with Rolling Stone, Fetterman also connected the sentiment in that tattoo — that of getting ""hurt"" — with the deaths that were recorded on the other side of his arm. ""That’s what it does to me,"" he said in the story. ""It’s very per­sonal."" We found no specific reference to the Crips in the coverage of Fetterman’s tattoos. And Fetterman’s campaign said Gingrich’s entire claim was wrong. But Newsweek noted in a fact-check that Fetterman talked about the Crips in a 2015 interview posted on Medium. In it, the interviewer asked Fetterman about why he spelled Braddock as ""Braddocc"" in campaign signs. Fetterman said it was a reference to gang spellings. This also provided the basis for the Sept. 26 Washington Free-Beacon story that Gingrich mentioned in his tweet. Fetterman’s full comments in the Medium post were: ""When I first came into office, I was elected because of the vote of the young people that I work with. I helped get their GEDs. When I first arrived in town, I noticed that they would spell it that way, and that’s a reference to ‘Crip killer’, they turned the ‘k’ into a ‘c’. So during my campaign, I [used] ‘Vote John Mayor of Braddocc’ and ‘Vote John Mayor of Braddock’ the way it’s traditionally spelled, and the reason why I did that is because there are two Braddocks, and you have to acknowledge that. We have to acknowledge that here’s the Braddock that only young people know, the Braddock of despair and decline, and they grew up in an era when they never knew there were 14 furniture stores and three movie theaters. And I caught some flak for that because some people thought I was spelling it like a gangster. No, there are two Braddocks. And we need to bring them together and agree on the way to move forward, so that’s why I spelled that the way I did. Because ultimately I carry their flag, because they’re the ones that made the difference that I won by one vote that first election."" Gingrich claimed on social media and on Fox News that Fetterman’s tattoos were references to heroin use or gangs. A review of Fetterman’s public statements going back to 2008 indicates that Fetterman got the ""15104"" tattoo on his left arm as a hat-tip to the town of Braddock, where he was mayor from 2006 to 2019. The tattoos on his right arm are numeric dates memorializing Braddock residents who died as a result of violent crime during his tenure. A tattoo that Fetterman used to have included the words ""I will make you hurt,"" a lyric from a song that referenced needle use. But Fetterman described it in 2009 as being connected to the pain he felt from these residents’ violent deaths.  The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression",Mostly False,"October 5, 2022"
Three court rulings since May 2022 “have made it clear that it is unconstitutional to ban someone between the ages of 18 and 20 from being able to buy an AR.”,"Amid calls for a special legislative session after the May 24 school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, the state's governor, Greg Abbott, has not changed his stance on gun laws or on calling a special session. Uvalde community members have called on officials to raise the minimum age from 18 to 21 to purchase semi-automatic rifles, like the AR-15-like assault-style rifle used to kill 19 children and two teachers at Robb Elementary. Some states have raised the age to buy a semi-automatic rifle to 21, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. While campaigning for re-election on Aug. 31, Abbott said the law that Uvalde residents are seeking ""has already been ruled to be unconstitutional."" ""There have been three court rulings since May that have made it clear that it is unconstitutional to ban someone between the ages of 18 and 20 from being able to buy an AR. That came out of the federal court of appeals,"" Abbott said, also claiming there was a Supreme Court decision that upheld the ruling. He also said ""a federal court in Texas struck down the Texas law that banned people between the ages of 18 and 20 from buying a handgun."" ""So, it is clear that the gun control law that they’re seeking in Uvalde, as much as they may want it, it has already been ruled to be unconstitutional,"" said Abbott, a former Texas attorney general and Texas Supreme Court justice. PolitiFact Texas took ""AR"" in Abbott’s claim to mean AR-15, a type of semi-automatic weapon. For this fact-check, we looked at whether the rulings pertained to AR-15s, or more broadly semi-automatic weapons. PolitiFact Texas spoke with experts and found that Abbott spoke broadly on those court rulings, and there has been no Supreme Court ruling addressing the constitutionality of raising the minimum age to purchase a semi-automatic weapon. Abbott’s office said these are the court rulings Abbott had in mind: Steven Vladeck, a University of Texas law professor, said, at most, only one case out of the three was apparently relevant to his claim, but that ruling was vacated in September. The Supreme Court case has nothing to do with age limits on gun purchases, and the Texas ruling pertains to ages but not semi-automatic rifles. The California 9th Circuit ruling, now vacated, addressed  age limits to purchase semi-automatic weapons, including AR-15s. The Supreme Court case examined what kind of proof is required for law-abiding citizens to carry handguns outside the home for self-defense. It decided in June that the state of New York cannot require proof of ""proper cause"" to carry, or ""a special need for self-defense."" The case dealt with a narrow question — what proof is required to carry a handgun in public, executive director of the Duke Center for Firearms Law Andrew Willinger, said. In the case, the Supreme Court dismissed the second step in a two-step legal test developed by the lower courts for gun law cases. This framework will be used to determine constitutionality in future Second Amendment court cases. For the first step, the Supreme Court said the burden is on the government to come up with historical gun laws that are similar to the types of law at issue in a case.  The test's second step was weighing the government’s justification for the law and the burdens the law imposed, Willinger said. Justifications could include, for example, empirical studies that the law in question makes the state safer.  ""I think it’s fair to say that Bruen is probably the most originalist or history-focused decision that the court has issued, maybe ever. It’s a real departure from what the lower courts were doing before,"" Willinger said.  In the second case Abbott mentioned, a Texas federal judge ruled in August that the state law prohibiting 18-, 19- and 20-year-olds from legally carrying a handgun violates the U.S. Constitution and cannot be enforced. That federal judge said the Second Amendment guarantees ""the right of the people to keep and bear Arms,"" and people is taken to mean ""the whole people,"" the judge wrote. This means 18-, 19- and 20-year-olds are included. The decision is expected to be appealed to the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals. The California 9th Circuit case addressed the question of raising the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic weapons. It had struck down the law that restricted 18- to 20-year-olds from purchasing semi-automatic rifles, while keeping the law requiring a hunting license for a young adult to purchase a long gun. This case, however, was not decided with the new framework from the Supreme Court because the Supreme Court case was decided before this case, Willinger said. The 9th Circuit had made its decision in May. Abbott spoke in August. Then, in September, the 9th Circuit vacated the decision. It remanded the case to the district court level to apply the framework from the Supreme Court case, Willinger noted. The decision had not been remanded when Abbott made his claim. ""I think it would be a fair guess to say that the law is still in some jeopardy, but we just don’t know and it’s going to take some time for the case to work its way all the way back up,"" Willinger said. In a separate case, a federal judge found Florida’s law restricting the purchase of semi-automatic rifles to people 21 years and older to be constitutional. Abbott did not mention that ruling, which the National Rifle Association is appealing. Willinger said it’s tough to say raising the minimum age is unconstitutional based on three rulings and no Supreme Court decision to settle the question. ""As you get fewer decisions on point, and at lower levels of the court system, it becomes very difficult to say it is clear or unclear that something’s unconstitutional. It’s just sort of an open question,"" Willinger said. ""I think when you say it’s clear something is unconstitutional, generally that would mean the Supreme Court has ruled on the specific question and made a decision one way or the other,"" Willinger added. Adam Winkler, a University of California, Los Angeles School of Law professor, told PolitiFact Texas that Abbott’s claim was wrong because the Supreme Court did not say anything about age restrictions on concealed carry. ""Also, while two cases have recently held 18-to-21 year restrictions unconstitutional, other courts have upheld such restrictions,"" Winkler wrote in an email. ""The 5th Circuit did so a few years back in a case that was appealed to the Supreme Court, and the justices allowed that ruling to stand. The justices have changed since then, but it remains to be seen if 18-21 age restrictions are truly unconstitutional."" Esther Sanchez-Gomez, a senior litigation attorney at the Giffords Law Center To Prevent Gun Violence, said Abbott’s claim is inaccurate. The center advocates for gun legislation. She said in an email that the decisions are narrower than Abbott implies. ""It is limited to the right to apply for a permit to carry (a) handgun in certain public spaces,"" Sanchez-Gomez said in an email regarding the Texas ruling. ""The court decided nothing about the constitutionality of restrictions on types of especially-lethal long guns, like ARs."" For the New York concealed carry ruling, she noted that the Supreme Court reaffirmed the Second Amendment right is ""not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever and for whatever purpose."" The court wrote there is historical tradition behind prohibiting the carrying of dangerous and unusual weapons while the Second Amendment protects the possession of weapons in common use. ""In short, Gov. Abbott is misinterpreting jurisprudence in order to attempt to defend his refusal to support common sense gun safety regulations,"" Sanchez-Gomez wrote. Abbott claimed that three court rulings since May 2022 ""have made it clear that it is unconstitutional to ban someone between the ages of 18 and 20 from being able to buy an AR."" Only one of the cases Abbott cited directly addressed limiting purchases of semi-automatic rifles. A California judge ruled the age restriction was constitutional and an appeals court disagreed, before vacating the ruling after Abbott’s statement. But Abbott also didn’t mention a case in Florida that is being appealed, in which a judge found the age limit did pass constitutional muster. Furthermore, the Supreme Court hasn’t weighed in on an age limit",Mostly False,"September 21, 2022"

A caption that was with the original Instagram post claimed the assault weapons ban would ""turn 150 million Americans into felons overnight."" But the post is being hyperbolic. The proposed assault weapons ban would allow current gun owners to keep the semi-automatic weapons they already have, they just wouldn’t be able to buy new ones.  Similar claims about gun owners potentially being turned into felons because of the proposed ban have been shared elsewhere on social media.  The offices of Reps. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., and David Cicilline, D-R.I., confirmed that existing gun owners will not be penalized under the bill and would not become felons overnight, as implied in the Instagram post. Nadler is the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, which advanced the bill to the House floor; Cicilline sponsored the measure. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. Instagram is owned by Facebook’s parent company, Meta. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) H.R. 1808, the Assault Weapons Ban of 2022, was proposed after a spate of mass shootings, including ones in Uvalde, Texas, and Buffalo, New York, that were perpetrated by men wielding AR-15-style rifles. It would make it illegal to manufacture, sell, transfer, import or possess semi-automatic weapons and high-capacity magazines. The U.S. previously passed an assault weapons ban in 1994, but it expired after 10 years. Although the bill passed the House with a 217-213 vote and near unanimous support from Democrats, it’s not expected to advance in the Senate, as it’s unlikely to get the 60 votes needed to overcome an expected Republican filibuster. If the measure passes the Senate, it would prohibit semi-automatic rifles, shotguns and pistols that can use a detachable magazine and have at least one type of military feature, such as a pistol grip, folding or detachable stock or threaded barrel. Rifles and shotguns made specifically for sporting or hunting are not a part of the ban.  Certain law enforcement efforts and authorized tests are exempted from the bill as are any actions related to securing nuclear materials. Also, retired law enforcement officers would be allowed to own semi-automatic weapons and high-capacity magazines. Any semi-automatic weapons or high-capacity magazines made after the bill takes effect would be required to display their manufacturing dates and serial numbers; no such requirement currently exists. People who lawfully own semi-automatic weapons and high-capacity magazines would have their ownership grandfathered in, provided the guns are securely stored in a way that prevents them from being accessed by another person. If people sell or transfer grandfathered weapons, the bill would require them to check the backgrounds of the people receiving them. Also, someone who had high-capacity magazines could keep them, but wouldn’t be able to sell or transfer them. The bill would also allow funding for state and local governments to buy back semi-automatic weapons or high-capacity magazines from people who own them. The Instagram post’s claim of 150 million Americans is also questionable. There is no national gun registry and federal law prohibits using the background check system to create one. So, the true number of gun owners in the country is unknown. Surveys may provide a rough estimate. Gallup found around 32% of adults it surveyed in 2020 said they own at least one gun. The 2020 U.S. Census counted 258.3 million adults 18 and older living in the United States. Thirty-two percent of them would be 82.6 million. A survey by Centiment in 2021 found results similar to Gallup’s. The company found that 31.9% of people surveyed reported owning a firearm and concluded that at least 81 million U.S. adults are gun owners — nowhere near the 150 million implied in the Instagram post. An Instagram post claimed the proposed assault weapons bill being considered by Congress will turn 150 million gun owners into felons overnight. The bill includes a provision that would allow lawful owners of semi-automatic weapons to keep them, but not sell or transfer them. The bill would also prohibit them from buying additional semi-automatic weapons and high-capacity magazines.   Also, because no national gun registry exists, it’s unknown how many gun owners there are in the country. However, a recent survey estimated there are about 81 million Americans who are gun owners, not 150 million, as the post implies",False,"August 3, 2022"
"Ron DeSantis ""opposes any background checks on guns, even for violent criminals.""","U.S. Rep. Charlie Crist warned in a new TV ad that another term for Gov. Ron DeSantis could bring lax background checks for gun purchases in Florida. ""Think about what’s at stake in Florida,"" Crist said in the July 14 spot, before referencing the governor's stance on abortion and his comments to high school students who wore masks to a March press conference.  Then Crist moved on to guns, ""Gov. Ron DeSantis ... opposes any background checks on guns, even for violent criminals."" Like federal law, Florida law requires licensed firearm dealers to conduct criminal history checks on prospective buyers. Someone convicted of a felony is prohibited from purchasing a firearm. Although DeSantis is a self-described ""big Second Amendment guy,"" PolitiFact could find no record of him condemning such statutes in Google search results or the Nexis news database.  When we asked Crist's campaign about his claim, a spokesperson said DeSantis hasn’t expressed support for background checks for anyone, ""let alone violent criminals."" But the campaign couldn’t point to a specific statement that suggested DeSantis opposes all background checks, either. Further, DeSantis hasn’t tried to remove such measures, though it’s not clear he could.  Asked about Crist’s characterization of DeSantis' stance, DeSantis press secretary Christina Pushaw said, ""Florida is a law and order state. Law-abiding citizens have the right to protect themselves."" PolitiFact found at least two occasions when DeSantis rebuffed efforts to expand background checks.  In 2020, Joe Gruters, a Republican state senator from Sarasota, introduced legislation that aimed to close the ""gun show loophole."" The bill would require a background check and a three-day waiting period on private-party sales at ""public places,"" such as gun shows.  While it garnered the support of then-state Senate President Bill Galvano, R-Bradenton, the bill faced staunch opposition from the National Rifle Association, or NRA. DeSantis, whom the NRA endorsed in the 2018 governor’s race, questioned the need for the legislation during a press conference.  ""The fact of the matter is that anyone who is selling firearms is going to have to do background checks, unless it’s just a private sale,"" DeSantis said. ""But you’re not going to have a table at a gun show on a private sale."" DeSantis misrepresented the ""gun show loophole,"" which zeroes in on unlicensed attendees who perform private firearm sales at gun shows. Gruters' bill didn’t pass.  After the May 24, 2022, school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, Democratic lawmakers in Florida called for a special session to address gun violence and tackle background check expansion. None of Florida's Republican legislators signed onto the effort.  In June, DeSantis criticized calls to hold a special session to address gun violence. ""With all due respect to these leftists, they just want to come after your Second Amendment rights.""  But he said criminals should not bear firearms. ""You focus on the criminal. You focus on the lunatic. You don't kneecap the rights of law-abiding citizens,"" DeSantis said in a June 8 press conference. In lieu of gun regulation, DeSantis said April 29 that he intends to sign a bill allowing ""constitutional carry,"" or the permitless carry of firearms.  ""We used to be a leader on the Second Amendment,"" DeSantis said during a news conference in Williston, Florida. ""There’s like 25 states that have already done it."" Twenty-five states, including Alabama, Idaho, Georgia and Texas, no longer require residents to obtain a permit from a law enforcement agency to carry a concealed gun. Florida is one of the more restrictive states when dictating how people can carry firearms, the Tampa Bay Times reported. Under existing state law, people who wish to carry hidden guns in public must obtain a ""concealed carry license"" from the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, which requires passing a fingerprint-based background check.  Floridians are generally barred from purchasing guns under state or federal law if they have been convicted of felonies or domestic violence misdemeanors. But concealed license applicants may also be denied under Florida law if they have been convicted of other violent misdemeanors.  A permitless carry law wouldn’t change federal law, which requires licensed gun sellers to check buyers’ backgrounds. Private sellers without federal licenses wouldn’t have to meet the same requirement for background checks. Giffords Law Center, a gun control advocacy group with offices in San Francisco and Washington, D.C., told PolitiFact that a permitless carry law could allow people who dodged background checks through private sales to carry guns in public. ""The law would likely make people convicted of violent misdemeanors newly eligible to legally carry firearms in public spaces and also make it easier for people with felony convictions to do so,"" said Ari Freilich, state policy director at Giffords Law Center. Crist said DeSantis ""opposes any background checks on guns, even for violent criminals."" That’s misleading. PolitiFact found no record of DeSantis opposing existing federal and state laws that require licensed gun dealers to check prospective buyers' backgrounds. But we did find DeSantis speaking out against criminals possessing firearms.  However, he hasn’t supported efforts to expand the criminal background check requirement to include gun sales by unlicensed sellers. DeSantis also promised to sign a ""constitutional carry"" bill. If passed, the law may allow people who evaded background checks through private sales to carry firearms publicly.  Crist’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression",Mostly False,"July 22, 2022"
“The gunman at Greenwood Park Mall was a CIA asset.”,"On July 17, an armed bystander returned fire and ended a mass shooting by killing an assailant who fired into a crowd at a Greenwood, Indiana, shopping mall. The gunman killed three people and wounded two others before he was killed, but the actions of the armed civilian who intervened and stopped the attack are fueling online speculation that the shooting was a planned Central Intelligence Agency operation. One meme showed someone smiling with the caption, ""CIA bois activating their Indiana asset."" It was followed by an image of the same person looking crestfallen with the words, ""CIA bois when he gets clapped by a legally armed civilian less than 30 seconds into his assignment.""  (Screen grab from Facebook.) The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) There’s no evidence that the gunman at Greenwood Park Mall was a CIA asset or that the CIA planned the attack. The 20-year-old shooter had spent a little more than an hour in a bathroom before emerging with a rifle and opening fire, CNN reported. He was stopped within minutes, when a legally armed bystander, Elisjsha Dicken, 22, returned fire, the Indianapolis Star reported. Greenwood Police Chief Jim Ison praised Dicken for his actions.  Police are still investigating the shooting and the motive of the gunman, who had a juvenile record, including a fight at school, but no criminal history as an adult, according to news reports. He’d quit his job at a warehouse in May and recently received an eviction notice, The New York Times reported. We found nothing that linked the gunman to the CIA.  The meme falsely suggests the shooting was a ""false flag,"" a harmful attack that is designed to look as if it were perpetrated by one person or group, but was committed by someone else. Following mass shootings, we frequently see unfounded claims that the attacks were ""false flags"" devised by government officials seeking to enact gun control laws. It is uncommon, but not unheard of, for an armed bystander to intervene during a shooting or attempted shooting.  After the Uvalde, Texas, school shooting in May, Pete Blair, the executive director of the Advanced Law Enforcement Rapid Response Training Center at Texas State University, told PolitiFact that active shooter incidents are most often resolved by an attacker fleeing.  That happened in about 25% of 434 active shooter incidents from 2000 until 2021, according to annual FBI data. The FBI defines an active shooter as ""one or more individuals actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people in a populated area."" In 22 of those cases, the shooting was stopped when an armed citizen, security officer or off-duty police officer shot the attacker. ""People at the scene did intervene, sometimes shooting the attackers, but typically physically subduing them,"" said The New York Times in its analysis of active shooting incidents. ""But in about half of all cases, the attackers commited suicide or simply stopped shooting and fled."" In May, for example, a woman shot and killed a man who started firing an AR-15-style rifle into a crowd of people at a party outside an Charleston, West Virginia, apartment complex, The Associated Press reported. No one in the crowd was injured. That an armed bystander stopped the mall shooting on July 17 is unusual. But it doesn’t show that the attack was part of a CIA operation. A viral post shared on Facebook suggested the Greenwood Park Mall shooter was a CIA-activated asset. The suggestion is tied to ""false flag"" claims, which happen frequently after mass shootings like the one in Indiana. Police are still investigating the shooting, but we found no evidence that the CIA planned Greenwood Park Mall shooting and an armed bystander’s intervention doesn’t show the attack was a ""false flag",False,"July 21, 2022"
"""38,000 Texans had their license to carry denied, revoked, or suspended over the last five years because law enforcement deemed them too dangerous to carry a loaded gun in public. But thanks to Greg Abbott's new law, they don't need a license to carry anymore.""","Many Texas officials were present as Gov. Greg Abbott held a May 25 news conference one day after a shooter killed two teachers and 19 children at an elementary school in Uvalde. Democratic gubernatorial candidate Beto O'Rourke rose from the audience and approached the stage. ""This is on you,"" O'Rourke told Abbott, his Republican opponent in the November election. ""Unless you choose to do something different, this will continue to happen. Somebody needs to stand up for the children of this state or they will continue to be killed, just like they were killed in Uvalde yesterday."" O'Rourke, who endorsed the mandatory buyback of military-style rifles when he ran for president in 2020, has continued to criticize pro-gun policies adopted by Texas' Republican leadership. On May 29, he tweeted, ""38,000 Texans had their license to carry denied, revoked, or suspended over the last five years because law enforcement deemed them too dangerous to carry a loaded gun in public. But thanks to Greg Abbott's new law, they don't need a license to carry anymore."" Is he right that people ""too dangerous to carry a loaded gun in public"" no longer need a license to carry? When we reached out for sources, O'Rourke's campaign pointed us to Texas Department of Public Safety data reports onlicense to carry applications denied, licenses revoked and licenses suspended. PolitiFact Texas contacted the Texas Department of Public Safety multiple times about permitless carry requirements but did not receive an answer. The campaign said the tweet was about House Bill 1927, one of many laws loosening gun restrictions that went into effect in 2021. That law allows people 21 years or older to carry a firearm without a license, except for those prohibited by federal and state law from possessing a firearm. The Department of Public Safety has data on licenses by calendar and fiscal year. When you add up the numbers for the past five fiscal years, there were nearly 35,000 licenses denied, suspended or revoked. In a follow-up phone call with O'Rourke's campaign, a spokesperson said the 38,000 statistic mistakenly encompasses six years, not five. For fiscal years 2016 to 2021, about 38,000 applications and licenses were denied, suspended or revoked.  So, O'Rourke's range of years was off by a year. PolitiFact Texas reached out to law experts to look at the second aspect of his claim: people who have had their handgun license denied, revoked or suspended now do not need a license to carry a handgun. Effective September 2021, the law no longer requires people to obtain a license to carry a concealed or holstered handgun in most public spaces in Texas. Obtaining a DPS-issued license requires applicants to pass a background check, complete a gun safety course, and meet specific eligibility requirements. HB 1927 stipulates, ""persons who are currently prohibited from possessing firearms under state and federal law will not gain the right to possess or carry a firearm under this legislation."" While it is accurate that people no longer need a license to carry, this part of the law is meant to prevent someone from carrying a gun who is barred by state or federal law from possessing a gun. Andi Turner, legislative director at the Texas State Rifle Association, pointed to this line in the law that prevents people ""deemed too dangerous"" from carrying a loaded handgun in public spaces. The law also defines who is prohibited from possessing a firearm, including people convicted of a felony or of certain assault offenses. HB 1927 and firearm possession law cover some of the same base eligibility requirements. Ari Freilich, state policy director at the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, said in an email that he believed O'Rourke's statement is accurate because HB 1927 made some people who previously could not qualify for a handgun carry permit newly eligible to carry guns in public because of gaps in the law. Before the permitless carry law took effect, some people could legally purchase a gun while being ineligible for a handgun carry permit, Freilich said. The Giffords Law Center gave three examples of this, documented in a 2019 report. For example, Freilich said, this would apply to an abusive partner threatening to shoot his spouse or child, as long as he didn't actually use or exhibit a firearm when threatening them. It is generally a Class C misdemeanor to intentionally or knowingly threaten another person, including a spouse or household member, with imminent bodily injury. But state prohibitions in firearm possession applies to felony and Class A misdemeanor assault convictions. Practically speaking, there is no longer a check on who is carrying because law enforcement can't legally require a license, Southern Methodist University law professor Eric Ruben said. ""The licensing process was a filter for weeding out who shouldn't otherwise carry handguns,"" Ruben said. ""And if someone was caught carrying a handgun, law enforcement would be able to ask, 'Do you have a license?' If a person didn't have a license, they'd be breaking the law."" Without being able to ask for a license, Ruben said, it will be hard to differentiate between someone who's lawfully carrying a gun or not. 
O'Rourke tweeted, ""38,000 Texans had their license to carry denied, revoked, or suspended over the last five years because law enforcement deemed them too dangerous to carry a loaded gun in public. But thanks to Greg Abbott's new law, they don't need a license to carry anymore."" O'Rourke tweeted the wrong number. It should have either been nearly 35,000 licenses denied, revoked, and suspended within the past five years or over 38,000 within the past six years. Though law enforcement is longer checking for licenses, the second part of O'Rourke's statement is an oversimplification. HB 1927 states, ""persons who are currently prohibited from possessing firearms under state and federal law will not gain the right to possess or carry a firearm under this legislation."" So, people ""too dangerous to carry a loaded gun"" would be kept from having one because of state and federal possession laws. But there are some gaps in the law, and keeping a statewide requirement for licenses would have made people meet more eligibility requirements",Mostly False,"July 21, 2022"
"Shooter in Highland Park, Illinois, “bought the gun illegally.”","A high-profile shooting that killed seven people and wounded many others on July 4 called attention to Illinois’ gun laws, which are considered some of the more restrictive in the U.S. Some social media users claimed Robert Crimo III, the 21-year-old who authorities say confessed to opening fire during an Independence Day celebration in Highland Park, obtained his firearms illegally. ""He bought the gun illegally,"" the July 5 post read. ""You FBI better step up on your game."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The overall post is riddled with misinformation and debunked narratives about the Jan. 6 Capitol riot and the Uvalde, Texas, school shooting in May. The post’s initial claim is wrong, too. Crimo’s weapons were purchased legally.  Crimo had a history of encounters with local police, but he was not barred from buying guns. In April 2019, police responded to a report that he had attempted suicide. In September 2019, he made threats that prompted local law enforcement officials to temporarily seize knives and a sword Crimo had kept in a closet.  In December 2019, Crimo applied for a Firearm Owners Identification (FOID) card, which is needed to legally buy firearms in Illinois. This was about three months after Highland Park police had filed a ""clear and present danger"" report about Crimo because of his threats. Because he was younger than 21 at the time, Crimo’s application included a legal guardian affidavit signed by his father.  Crimo legally obtained his FOID card in 2020 after his application was reviewed, The Chicago Tribune reported. He also passed four background checks when purchasing firearms between June 2020 and September 2021. His criminal history included a possession of tobacco violation and he had no ""mental health prohibitor reports,"" according to law enforcement.  From 2020 and 2021, authorities say Crimo legally purchased five guns, including the one he used during the July 4 attack, Reuters reported. Illinois has a red flag law that would have allowed Crimo’s family or law enforcement to petition a judge to temporarily prevent Crimo from possessing or obtaining firearms because he was considered dangerous. In this case, however, neither law enforcement nor any family members filed a petition seeking to prevent Crimo from acquiring guns. A Facebook post claimed that Crimo ""bought the gun illegally."" Investigators told news outlets that Crimo obtained the proper identification to legally purchase firearms and passed several background checks before ultimately buying his weapons legally",False,"July 12, 2022"
"Says an image shows the Highland Park shooting suspect ""in jail or rehab or a psychiatric center"" before the shooting.","Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., shared a doctored image that she falsely claimed showed the suspect in the Highland Park, Illinois, mass shooting was in a ""in jail or rehab or a psychiatric center"" before he opened fire on the Chicago suburb’s July 4 parade. Police took into custody Robert Crimo III of Highwood, Illinois, after they said he positioned himself on a nearby roof and fired the shots that killed seven people and injured dozens more.  Crimo had not been charged with a crime by midafternoon July 5, and much remained unknown about his life leading up to the shooting, including details regarding his mental health or arrest history. Our fact-checks disrupt the agendas of politicians across the ideological spectrum. Support the truth today.  Here’s some of what we have learned from police as of July 5: Crimo attempted suicide in 2019. That same year, law enforcement officials also seized dozens of knives and a sword from him after a family member reported that he threatened to ""kill everyone,"" but Crimo was not arrested over the incident. The 21-year-old had posted violent imagery and discourse online. He was living at the time of the attack in an apartment behind a house owned by his father, according to reports, and he purchased the firearm police said he used to carry out the attack legally.  But before many of those details had been revealed, Greene had already posted the altered image of Crimo twice, using it to make a political point about guns and mental health. In the image, which Greene first tweeted July 4 alongside other photos of Crimo, Crimo looks as if he’s seated in a compact, windowless cell and holding a Bible. The second time Greene shared the image was on July 5, when she posted a Twitter thread arguing that the attack and other recent mass shootings should not be blamed on lax gun laws.  ""The public should not allow this to continue,"" Greene wrote. ""People are not stupid. Is he in jail or rehab or a psychiatric center in this photo? That’s not his bedroom. 22 yrs old and 5’11 and 120 lbs is not normal or healthy. What drugs or psychiatric drugs or both does he use?"" Greene framed the image as evidence of Crimo’s ""very dark"" history.  ""Until we are willing to rip open the ugly truth about the dark and destructive path these young men are on that lead them to mass shootings, then they will continue,"" she said. ""No matter how many gun control laws are passed. Even with no guns at all, evil will find a way until it’s fixed."" The image is noticeably edited. There’s no evidence that it actually shows Crimo ""in jail or rehab or a psychiatric center"" prior to his July 4 parade attack, as Greene claimed. ""This is an obvious fake,"" said Hany Farid, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, and an expert on image analysis and digital forensics. ""There are clear signs of manipulation around his head and hair, the resolution on his face is inconsistent with the background, and the lighting and shading on his face is inconsistent with the rest of the scene."" PolitiFact could not pinpoint where the image originated, but we found the same image posted on several since-suspended Twitter accounts that appear to have been affiliated with Crimo or the stage name he adopted as an amateur rapper, ""Awake the Rapper."" A Twitter spokesperson confirmed that the company suspended accounts that ""may belong to the alleged perpetrator,"" per its rules around perpetrators of violent attacks.  Shortly after sharing the image for the second time to her nearly 1 million Twitter followers,  Greene retweeted it again and said, ""This is supposedly photoshopped.""  Greene’s office did not respond to a request for comment",False,"July 5, 2022"
"No one “with a concealed carry permit ever committed a mass shooting.""","Weeks after massacres in Buffalo, New York, and Uvalde, Texas, Fox News host Greg Gutfeld falsely claimed that nobody with a concealed carry permit had ever committed a mass shooting. The comment came as Gutfeld and the co-hosts of ""The Five"" discussed the Supreme Court’s ruling striking down a New York law that put limits on carrying a concealed firearm in public.  ""I think about mass shooters,"" Gutfeld said June 23. ""I don't believe — and someone correct me later, I won't listen — but I don't believe anybody with a concealed carry permit ever committed a mass shooting. So I think the ban itself had no role in preventing these things, right?"" Now more than ever, it’s important to sort fact from fiction. Please donate to support our mission.  Here’s the correction Gutfeld asked for: His claim is wrong. Concealed carry laws, which are on the books in about half the states, are laws that require a permit to carry a firearm in public. Jaclyn Schildkraut, who researches mass shootings as an associate professor of criminal justice at the State University of New York, Oswego, said there is no national registry of concealed carry permits across those states. But a ""two-second Google search"" shows Gutfeld’s claim is ""inaccurate,"" Schildkraut said. ""Absolutely, wholly inaccurate,"" added Kristen Rand, government affairs director for the nonprofit Violence Policy Center, which tracks such cases as part of its focus on reducing gun violence. Citing news reports that indicate when a mass shooter had a concealed carry permit — including articles from Fox News’s own website — the Violence Policy Center counted 37 mass shootings by concealed carry permit holders between May 2007 and May 2022.  The list includes the accused shooter who killed 11 people at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh in October 2018. It includes a 2017 shooting that killed three people at a Florida airport, and a 2019 shooting in which 13 people, including the shooter, died in Virginia Beach, Virginia. The Violence Policy Center defines a mass shooting as a killing of three or more people; that’s in line with the definition used under a 2013 federal mandate to investigate such attacks following the December 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. There is no legal definition of a mass shooting, PolitiFact previously reported. Fox News did not respond to a request for comment. Gun rights advocates have often pointed to research showing that people with concealed carry permits have used their firearms to stop likely mass shootings.  Daniel Webster, who co-authored a 2020 study from Johns Hopkins University, told NPR in May that his research does not support the argument that carrying guns for self defense can help stop mass shootings.  ""The data do not bear that out at all,"" said Webster, co-director of the Center for Gun Violence Solutions at Johns Hopkins’ Bloomberg School of Public Health. ""If anything, it shows higher rates of fatal mass shootings in response to weaker regulations for concealed carry by civilians."" A report Schildkraut wrote in 2018 said handguns were used in about three out of every four mass shootings. ""It’s difficult to conceal anything other than a handgun due to size,"" she told PolitiFact. Gutfeld said, ""I don't believe anybody with a concealed carry permit ever committed a mass shooting."" That’s inaccurate; there have been several such cases, including the 2018 mass shooting that left 11 dead at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. Citing media reports, the nonprofit Violence Policy Center has counted 37 mass shootings that were committed by concealed carry permit holders since 2007",False,"June 28, 2022"
"Says U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, his prospective opponent, has received $1.2 million from the gun lobby.","Following the mass shooting at a school in Uvalde, Texas, the U.S. Senate has moved to address gun violence — a measure some argues does too little, while others say goes too far. In Wisconsin, Democrats running for the U.S. Senate have been targeting incumbent Ron Johnson, a Republican seeking a third term. That includes Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, who in a May 27, 2022, news release said: ""Ron Johnson will do or say anything to distract from the $1.2 million he’s taken from the gun lobby.""  Has Johnson really accepted that much money from the pro-gun lobby?  When we reached out to Barnes’ campaign, press secretary Lauren Chou pointed to data collected by Brady United, a nonpartisan gun violence prevention group founded after the passage of the Brady Law in 1993. The data outlines which U.S. senators have benefitted the most from donations from the National Rifle Association.  According to the data, Johnson has received nearly $1.27 million from the NRA during his time as a senator, including both direct campaign contributions and indirect spending, such as TV commercials.  OpenSecrets, a nonpartisan nonprofit research group that tracks money in politics, had similar numbers. According to its database on spending by gun interest groups, Johnson has received $222,529 in direct support, in addition to more than $1 million in outside spending since he took office in 2017. (That counts spending in support of Johnson, or against his opponents).  That leads to an important distinction we want to underline. While Johnson has received about $1.2 million in overall support from pro-gun groups since his first election in 2010, only about $223,000 has been directly accepted by his campaign. As noted, the other $1 million has been spent on his behalf by those groups.  So, Barnes is off in how he characterizes it. ""We determined approximately 83 percent of the dollars they say Senator Johnson has ‘taken from the gun lobby’ are independent expenditures over which he had absolutely no control, and in fact, did not have any personal knowledge of,"" said Alexa Henning, a Johnson campaign spokesperson.  For context, a May 27, 2022, report, TMJ4-TV in Milwaukee took a look at how the gun lobby’s spending on Johnson compares to other politicians. Johnson had the 15th highest total of any current elected officials in the U.S., the report said. It also noted that the NRA has spent more than $771,000 against Wisconsin’s other U.S. Senator, Democrat Tammy Baldwin. That’s the 10th highest dollar amount spent against any sitting elected official.  Our ruling Barnes claimed Johnson has taken $1.2 million from the gun lobby.  Data shows that Johnson has received — through both direct and indirect contributions — about $1.2 million in support since his first campaign started in 2016.  But of that, only about $200,000 went directly to his campaign. The rest — more than $1 million — represents outside spending either in support of Johnson, or against his opponents over time. So, Barnes is off in his wording",Half True,"June 28, 2022"

His spokesperson pointed to research from the advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety that indeed found Black people in Virginia were eight times more likely than white people to be victims of firearm homicides between 2016 to 2020.   Everytown attributed the statistic and others in its report to the CDC. So, we went to the CDC’s national database of underlying causes of death to examine the numbers. Here’s what we found about Virginia from 2016 to 2020: White people comprised 63% of Virginia’s population; Black people made up 20%. There were 1,814 gun homicides, killing 1,269 Black people and 518 white people. In other words, 70% of victims were Black and 29% white. Out of every 100,000 Black people living in Virginia, 14.3 were killed in a firearm homicide. Per 100,000 white Virginians, 1.7 were killed in that manner. The firearm murder rate for Black people was 8.4 times higher than the rate for white people. Everytown accurately rounded down to eight times, the number Stoney used. Nationally, Black people were 11.2 times more likely than white people to be murdered by firearms. The rates were 21.3 per 100,000 for Black people and 1.9 per 100,000 for white people. The racial disparity is even wider among males, who were victims in 85% of U.S. firearm homicides from 2016 to 2020. Nationally, 39.7 per 100,000 Black males were killed in gun homicides compared with 2.8 white males per 100,000. Black males were 14.2 times more likely to be murdered by firearms. In Virginia, 26.1 per 100,000 Black males were gun homicide victims compared with 2.4 per 100,000 white males. Black males were 10.9 times more likely to be murdered by firearms. In Richmond, 65.6 Black males per 100,000 were firearm homicide victims. The CDC does not have a corresponding figure for white males. We should finally note that Greene, the health commissioner, has been roundly criticized for his comments, including by the person who appointed him: Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin. Greene has tempered his statements dismissing the role of structural racism in public health since they were first reported by The Washington Post on June 15. Our ruling Stoney said, ""In Virginia, Black people are eight times (8X) more likely than white people to die of gun homicide."" CDC figures show that 14.3 out of every 100,000 Black Virginians were killed in gun homicides from 2016 to 2020. The rate for white people was 1.7 per 100,000. In other words, Black people in Virginia were 8.4 times more likely than white people to be murdered by firearms. A report cited by Stoney accurately rounded the figure down to eight times more likely",True,"June 24, 2022"
"Waiting periods for gun purchases may not make a difference, because ""If somebody's decided that they're gonna take their life, they're gonna take their life.""","Editor’s note: If you or someone you know is dealing with suicidal thoughts, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at (800) 273-8255 or text ""Hopeline"" to the National Crisis Text Line at 741-741. The mass shooting at an Uvalde, Texas, elementary school in late May — the second-deadliest school shooting in the nation’s history — has resurfaced arguments for stricter gun laws in the Wisconsin Legislature.  For years, Democrats have pushed to tighten restrictions around firearm purchases, such as expanding background checks to private sales and enacting red flag laws (which allow police or family members to petition a court to remove firearms from anyone deemed dangerous to themselves or others). Republicans who control the Legislature have largely resisted such measures, and after Uvalde, advocated for beefing up school security.    From the mid-1970s through 2015, Wisconsin had another type of gun law on the books: one that prohibited a handgun-buyer from taking possession of the gun until 48 hours after the background check had been started.  State Sen. Van Wanggaard, R-Racine, introduced a 2015 bill — which was approved — that instead allows buyers to take possession of the gun immediately after they clear a background check.  In a June 5, 2022 appearance on Capital City Sunday, Wanggaard was asked if that 48-hour waiting period should be reinstated. His response: ""Absolutely not.""  ""I don’t know that that saves anything,"" Wanggaard said of the waiting period. ""If somebody’s decided that they’re going to take their life, they’re going to take their life.""  The senator’s remark is off-base. While research on the effectiveness of 48-hour waiting periods on reducing overall violence is mixed, studies show it can reduce suicide deaths in particular. Furthermore, experts say many suicide deaths are preventable.  Let’s take a look.  When asked for evidence to back up Wanggaard’s claim, a spokesperson from his office wrote that the remark was based on his three decades as a police officer and the experiences of several people he knew who died by suicide.  Because early intervention with potentially suicidal people has shown effectiveness, the spokesperson wrote, Wanggaard also believes if a person thinks someone they know may be thinking of suicide, they should reach out and get that person help.  Wanggaard’s staff cited a June 2005 study referenced in a more recent report from the medical journal BMC Psychiatry about the likelihood of a person who had attempted suicide trying to do so again.  But the study’s results disprove Wanggaard’s claim that a person who decides they want to die by suicide will do so — in the five years following a previous attempt, 37% made at least one more attempt that did not result in death, and just 6.7% did die by suicide. That means that the majority of the people in that study had at one point decided they were going to take their own life and ultimately did not.  Suicide is widely recognized as preventable. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says it can be prevented through better treatment for people at risk of suicide, crisis intervention, stronger supports for mental health and financial stability and reduction of access to lethal means for people at risk of suicide, among others.  In a 2008 report about guns and suicide, David Hemenway, director of Harvard University’s Injury Control Research Center, wrote that studies show that ""most attempters act on impulse, in moments of panic or despair. Once the acute feelings ease, 90% do not go on to die by suicide.""  Wanggaard’s spokesperson also sent a July 3, 2017 Reuters article about a study from the Annals of Internal Medicine where the lead researcher had written that ""few"" suicide deaths could be prevented by limiting firearm access for those with a substance abuse disorder, mental health condition or a history of suicide attempts.  But the study isn’t saying that limiting firearm access won’t reduce suicide deaths. It’s saying that limiting access for that specific group of people won’t reduce them by much — and the researchers actually argue that those confines are too narrow.  ""We suggest that prevention of firearm suicide should be expanded beyond the current focus on these patients to include other persons at risk for suicide,"" the study says.  It’s worth noting that it also calls for expanding attention to suicide prevention measures beyond an exclusive focus on firearms to include other common means of suicide.  Evidence about whether 48-hour waiting periods on gun purchases can reduce overall violence is mixed, as laid out in a Feb. 2, 2022 fact-check from PolitiFact Wisconsin examining a state Democratic lawmaker’s claim about a similar issue.  But recent studies have found a correlation between waiting periods and a reduction in suicide deaths specifically, University of Wisconsin-Madison professor John Gross told us.  A March 2, 2018 analysis of previous studies of the relationship between waiting periods and suicides from the RAND Corporation found moderate evidence that waiting periods reduce suicides by firearm, and limited evidence that they reduce overall suicide deaths.  And a March 24, 2018 fact-check of Doug Jones, a Democrat and then-U.S",Mostly True,"June 21, 2022"
"“U.S. House of Reps. votes 226-194 to criminalize disassembling, cleaning, and re-assembling your gun without a firearm manufacturer’s license, including 8 Republicans!”","The Democratic-led U.S. House passed a bill restricting access to firearms on many fronts in response to the May mass shooting that left 19 children and two adults dead in Uvalde, Texas.  The Protecting Our Kids Act includes regulations against selling firearms to people under 21, criminal offenses for gun trafficking, and more. It’s almost certain not to progress in the U.S. Senate, where lawmakers are working on a less restrictive set of proposals. An organization that supports easier access to firearms raised alarms about the House legislation, though the group overstated how far the measure would really go. ""U.S. House of Reps. votes 226-194 to criminalize disassembling, cleaning, and re-assembling your gun without a firearm manufacturer’s license, including 8 Republicans!"" tweeted Gun Owners of America. U.S. House of Reps. votes 226-194 to criminalize disassembling, cleaning, and re-assembling your gun without a firearm manufacturer’s license, including 8 Republicans!   The group’s claim received thousands of retweets and comments, and a screenshot was shared on Instagram and Facebook. The post wasn’t specific about what legislation it was referencing. But when we reached out to Gun Owners of America, a spokesperson there pointed us to the Protecting Our Kids Act, or H.R. 7910. That full bill passed by a 223-204 vote, with five Republicans voting in favor, but a portion of the bill dealing specifically with ""ghost guns"" did receive a 226-194 vote with eight Republicans in favor. But does that bill really ban someone from cleaning their gun without a manufacturer’s license? In a word, no. The bill aims to stop a workaround for people who haven’t passed background checks from assembling their own from untraceable parts.  Walter Smoloski, spokesperson for Gun Owners of America, directed us to Title III of the bill, which requires that all firearms be traceable with a serial number. This is an effort to prohibit ""ghost guns,"" or, according to a definition in the legislation, guns that lack ""a unique serial number engraved or cast on the frame or receiver by a licensed manufacturer or importer."" Practically speaking, ""ghost guns"" are often assembled at home from a kit or from a 3D printer.  The finished gun often ""lacks a serial number or other identifying information that is typically required for traditionally manufactured guns,"" said Alex McCourt, director of legal research at the Center for Gun Violence Solutions at Johns Hopkins University. ""So it’s a privately made, untraceable gun.""  Ghost guns have been a point of contention for lawmakers — in April 2022, the Justice Department announced a rule  to better regulate ghost guns. The Biden administration said that last year the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives reported about 20,000 ghost guns had been recovered by law enforcement during criminal investigations — a tenfold increase from 2016. But Smoloski said the House’s bill would regulate parts of a gun that aren’t usually serialized, like the ""upper receiver of an AR-15,"" and thus label the entire firearm as a ghost gun.  It’s true that AR-15 weapons typically have serial numbers on the lower part of the firearm’s receiver. But McCourt said if people bought this type of firearm legally, they are not the target of this bill.  ""The target is not to trick people into committing a crime,"" McCourt said. Gun Owners of America also takes issue with the bill’s definition of manufacturing a gun, which includes ""assembling a functional firearm or molding, machining, or 3D printing a frame or receiver, and shall not include making or fitting special barrels, stocks, or trigger mechanisms to firearms.""  ""H.R. 7910 prohibits anyone from ‘manufactur(ing) a ghost gun,'"" Smoloski said, ""even though ‘manufacturing firearms’ includes anyone disassembling, cleaning, and then ‘assembling’ common gun parts back into ‘a functional firearm.’"" Rukmani Bhatia, senior federal affairs manager at the Giffords anti-gun violence organization, told fact-checkers at The Associated Press that this is not so: ""There is nothing in Title III that would bar a law-abiding gun owner who has a firearm that is serialized from taking that gun apart, cleaning it, and putting it back together in their home."" McCourt also said this section isn’t meant for private owners. ""I think the bill is pretty clearly talking about making ghost guns from kits or other individual parts that lack serial numbers and/or more people that are engaged in the business of firearm manufacturing,"" he said. John Donohue, a law professor at Stanford University and a statistical analyst on topics such as guns and crime, said the Gun Owners of America suggests the worst-possible scenario of what could happen under the bill. The definition of what manufacturing a gun means may be vague, he said, but the scenario that gun owners would be criminalized for cleaning their weapons would be unlikely.  Ultimately, the bill’s goal is to prevent people who could not pass a background check from skirting the law and buying gun parts to assemble into a working firearm.  ""Obviously, if you bought the gun and went through a background check, there wouldn’t be any problem about taking it apart and putting it back together,"" Donohue said. ""Judges would understand this and would presumably apply the law appropriately."" If there was any fear about ambiguity in the law, Donohue said, a simple tweak would solve it. ""Of course there is plenty of opportunity to provide that tweak because the House bill would not go into effect unless the Senate passed a similar bill,"" he said. House Judiciary Committee spokesman Dan Rubin said that the purpose of Title III is to prevent people from building guns at home that lack the ""proper, legal tracking mechanism"" — like a serial number — that every other legal firearm has. ""So, if you currently own a gun that you purchased legally from a federally licensed gun store, it is not a ghost gun and has absolutely nothing to do with this title, and you could clean it, disassemble it or do whatever else you want (in accordance with state and federal laws, of course), and this bill in no way would affect that,"" Rubin said. We found no instances in which Democrats said the measure would ban gun-cleaning. On June 12, a bipartisan group of senators announced it had agreed on the framework for a package that would encourage states to pass ""red flag"" laws to remove firearms from possibly dangerous people, as well as provide finances for mental health resources and school security.  A tweet from Gun Owners of America said, ""U.S. House of Reps. votes 226-194 to criminalize disassembling, cleaning, and re-assembling your gun without a firearm manufacturer’s license, including 8 Republicans!"" The Protecting Our Kids Act passed by a 223-204 vote, with five Republicans in favor; a portion dealing with ghost guns was approved 226-194, with eight Republicans in favor. The bill is unlikely to take effect. As written, it would prevent people who can’t pass a background check from buying untraceable firearm parts and assembling them into a ghost gun. Legal experts said it’s a misreading to suggest the bill would criminalize disassembling, cleaning, and reassembling a gun",False,"June 17, 2022"
“Not a single person in the crowd on January 6 was found to be carrying a firearm. Not one.”,"As the first House hearing dedicated to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol aired, Fox News host Tucker Carlson repeated the debunked claim that no one in the crowd was found with a gun.   ""Just to be clear on terms, an insurrection is when people with guns try to overthrow the government,"" Carlson said during his June 10 segment. ""Not a single person in the crowd on January 6 was found to be carrying a firearm. Not one,"" Carslon said. That’s wrong. Court documents, video evidence and news coverage directly contradict this characterization. Several rioters had firearms and dozens more wielded knives, bats and other real and makeshift weapons. We reached out to Carlson for comment but did not hear back. PolitiFact reviewed the case files for hundreds of defendants who were arrested and charged for their actions at the Capitol on Jan. 6 and found several defendants who police say were found to have brought firearms. Some were charged with having firearms on Capitol grounds while others stashed them nearby: Lonnie Coffman of Alabama was found with multiple weapons in his vehicle and on his person. Coffman’s truck, which he had parked in the vicinity of the Capitol on the morning of Jan. 6, was packed with weaponry, including a handgun, a rifle and a shotgun, each loaded, according to court documents. Also, the truck held hundreds of rounds of ammunition, several large-capacity ammunition feeding devices, a crossbow with bolts, machetes, camouflage smoke devices, a stun gun and 11 Molotov cocktails. When Coffman was detained, questioned and searched, police found two more handguns on his person. None of the weapons were registered, documents state. Coffman pleaded guilty and was sentenced in April to 46 months in prison followed by three years of supervised release. Guy Reffitt of Texas was charged with bringing a handgun onto Capitol grounds. Court documents showed that Reffitt, reported to be a member of the Three Percenters militia group, told his family he brought his gun with him and that he and others ""stormed the Capitol."" A jury found Reffitt guilty of five felony charges in March, and he remains detained pending sentencing. Christopher Michael Alberts of Maryland also brought his handgun onto Capitol grounds. An officer saw that Alberts had a gun on his hip and alerted fellow officers. When Alberts tried to flee, officers detained him and recovered the loaded handgun, along with a separate magazine. He has been indicted on ten felony counts. In his conspiratorial documentary series ""Patriot Purge,"" Carlson featured Mark Ibrahim, a former U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent, and falsely claimed that Ibrahim was forced from his job and indicted for simply being near the Capitol protest.  But court documents show that Ibrahim had already submitted his intent to resign from the DEA weeks before Jan. 6 and was indicted because he brought a gun with him onto Capitol grounds and made false statements to federal agents. The number of people who carried firearms with them that day may not ever be fully accounted for because the majority of those involved in the siege weren’t arrested on-site but were tracked down by law enforcement days, weeks and months later. It’s also important to note that an insurrection is a violent uprising against the government, and the definition of ""armed"" is not legally limited to guns; it refers to any weapon used for defense or offense and as a means of protection. Other items used as weapons on Jan. 6 included bats, crutches, flagpoles, skateboards, fire extinguishers and chemical sprays. Carlson claimed that no one in the crowd on Jan. 6 was found with a firearm. That’s inaccurate. Many of those involved in the attack were armed, and several had guns that police later seized",False,"June 13, 2022"
"White supremacists are going to be “shooting up all Walmarts and will kill Blacks and Mexicans” in San Bernardino, California.","An Instagram post gave a stark warning to stay away from Walmart stores in California’s San Bernardino County, alleging that police there were warned that white supremacists were planning mass shootings. The post comes soon after two horrific mass shootings, one at an Uvalde, Texas, elementary school, where 21 people, including 19 children, were killed, and another at the Tops Friendly Markets store in Buffalo, New York, where 10 Black people died in what authorities say was a racially motivated attack. But the threats are not credible, police in San Bernardino said, and there have been a number of similar threats nationwide in the past week. ""DO NOT GO TO WALMART,"" an Instagram post on June 4 began in all caps. It went on to say that San Bernardino County police received a tip that white supremacists have ""made it clear they are shooting up all Walmarts and will kill Blacks and Mexicans."" The post has garnered more than 6,600 likes as of June 8. Multiple posts making similar claims can be found on Facebook. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post urged followers to share the news, then added ""don’t know if it’s true or not, but just a heads up."" There are no credible threats to Walmart stores in San Bernardino, police there told PolitiFact on June 6. Sgt. Equino Thomas, a spokesperson for the San Bernardino Police Department, said the department's intelligence unit had been monitoring reports of similar threats nationwide since last week, and found ""there was no legitimacy to it.""  ""This was not specific to San Bernardino or San Bernardino County,"" Thomas said. Mara Rodriguez, a spokesperson with the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Office, said the department’s intelligence team looked into this posting and found no credible threat. ""We continue to monitor any possible threats and work closely with other agencies to maintain the safety of the public,"" Rodriguez said. There have been several reported threats about possible shootings at Walmart around the country in recent weeks that were false, and at least one that led to an arrest, according to news reports. It’s not clear if the threats are widespread or connected in any way. The FBI, the Department of Justice and Walmart did not return our requests for comment. On May 26, fact-checkers at the Associated Press reported there were false claims on social media about two armed men who threatened to kill Black people at a Walmart in Bowie, Maryland, before they were stopped by undercover agents. The Bowie Police Department debunked the claims in a Twitter thread, and a Walmart spokesperson also told the AP they were false. Police in Springfield Township in northeast Ohio said in a Facebook post on June 2 that they were investigating a threat made about a random shooting at a Walmart there, but said ""we do not feel that the threat is credible."" In Wooster, Ohio, police said on June 2 they arrested a man they say made a threat on social media with ""what appeared to be a firearm."" They did not specify what the threat was, but said rumors that spread online of an active shooter at a Walmart store were false. Police in Lancaster, South Carolina, said on June 3 that someone called in a threat to a Walmart store there. Officers responded, but there was no incident. There is no suspect, and the case is under investigation, they said. Police in nearby Rock Hill also responded to a Walmart store there after reports that the suspect may be in that area, but there was also no incident. In Durant, Oklahoma, police said they arrested a man on June 2 after receiving a tip that he threatened to shoot up a Walmart there, according to KXII-12. In Amherst, New York, a Walmart store temporarily closed on May 16 — two days after the Buffalo attack — when an online threat was made to kill Black shoppers, according to the Buffalo News. A Sam’s Club and two Tops stores in the area were also threatened. No arrests have been announced by police in that case, though one man was arrested in separate shooting threats at a pizzeria and brewery. It’s not the first time Walmart stores have been the subject of threats after a mass shooting. In the days after an attack on Aug. 3, 2019, at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, that left 23 people dead, CNN reported several threats were made at Walmart stores around the country. Copycat threats are not uncommon after such events. In Uvalde, more than a dozen school districts across Texas reported receiving threats after the Robb Elementary School attack, Axios reported. After a mass shooter at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, killed 17 people on Feb. 14, 2018, there were more than 700 copycat threats at schools nationwide within a few weeks, according to the Educator’s School Safety Network.  ""In the aftermath of a school shooting tragedy, school shootings are front of mind for everyone, and people may be more inclined to report suspected threats of violence, thus increasing the number of threats,"" said James Densley, a professor and department chair in the School of Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice at Metropolitan State University in Minnesota. Densely said that Michigan’s online threat reporting system received more than 3,000 tips after a school shooting in Oxford left four students dead and seven others injured in 2021. Hundreds of school districts across the country also received threats. Many were not credible, Densely said, but schools were often closed as a precaution. Even if threats are eventually deemed not credible, law enforcement agencies must take them seriously. The Department of Homeland Security on June 7 issued a new terrorism threat bulletin, mentioning the racially motivated attack in Buffalo as an example of ""the dynamic and complex nature of the threat environment."" The department urged Americans to report threats of violence, including online threats, to local police. Social media posts warned shoppers to stay away from Walmart stores in San Bernardino because police there were warned of threats by white supremacists to kill Black and Mexican shoppers. But police officials in the city and county said there were no credible threats, and a spokesperson for the San Bernardino Police Department said they were monitoring reports of threats nationwide, not specific to the city or county.  Nationally, there have been a few cases of threats being made to Walmart stores, but most were not deemed credible",False,"June 8, 2022"
Gun manufacturers are “the only industry in the country” that have immunity from lawsuits.,"In the wake of the deadly elementary school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, President Joe Biden repeated an inaccurate talking point in his push for gun control legislation, saying that gun manufacturers represent the ""only industry"" with liability immunity.  ""We should repeal the liability shield that often protects gun manufacturers from being sued for the death and destruction caused by their weapons,"" Biden wrote in a June 2 tweet. ""They’re the only industry in the country that has this kind of immunity. It’s outrageous. It must end."" He said the same thing in a speech about gun violence (around the 18:28-minute mark).  This isn’t the first time Biden has made this claim. He’s made it repeatedly, including April 2021 remarks about gun violence after a man went on a shooting rampage at three spas in the Atlanta area, killing eight, and another gunman killed 10 people at a grocery store in Boulder, Colorado. He said it again in his 2022 State of the Union address. But the claim is inaccurate. The gun industry is susceptible to some lawsuits, and there are federal laws restricting liability for a number of other types of businesses. We reached out to the White House for comment but did not hear back.  The legislation at issue is the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, which was signed into law in 2005 by President George W. Bush. The law says gun dealers and manufacturers cannot be sued when their products are misused.  But the law lists several situations that are not protected from liability. It doesn’t protect gun dealers who transfer a gun knowing it would be used for criminal purposes, nor those who knowingly break state or federal law if the violation results in harm. Gun manufacturers can also be sued for certain injuries due to gun design defects. Supporters say the law protects gun dealers and manufacturers from frivolous and expensive proceedings, while opponents argue that the broadness of the law and its narrow exceptions stops some victims from having their day in court. But this is different from saying the gun industry is immune to all lawsuits. For example, in 2019, the Supreme Court allowed a lawsuit brought by nine Sandy Hook victims’ families against gun manufacturer Remington Arms Company to continue. Remington Arms manufactured the gun used in the mass shooting and the plaintiffs sought to hold the company partly responsible by targeting its marketing practices. The families settled with the gunmaker in February for $73 million. Other industries have exemptions in liability. For example, a 1980s-era law states that vaccine manufacturers cannot be held liable in civil suits brought by victims of injuries that they saw were caused by defective vaccines. This differs from the gun legislation, however, because it established the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, through which alleged victims can make a claim and receive compensation. This money comes from the government, not the companies. It’s also important to note that, until 2024, pharmaceutical companies that make the COVID-19 vaccines will have liability immunity under a 2005 public health law. There’s also some liability protection in the medical devices and airline industries, Walter Olson, senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute and expert in tort law, previously told PolitiFact. For example, the 1994 General Aviation Revitalization Act said that small aircraft manufacturers cannot be sued for accidents involving aircraft more than 18 years old. ""It’s not at all unique to the gun industry. It’s a version (of liability law) Congress developed for an industry that was under very heavy attack,"" Olson said, referring to the slew of litigation against gun sellers and makers that prompted Congress to pass the law. Biden said that gun manufacturers represent the only industry in America that is exempt from being sued.  This isn’t accurate. The gun industry is not entirely exempt from being sued and is susceptible to some lawsuits. Further, there are federal laws that restrict liability for a variety of other business sectors",False,"June 8, 2022"
"The sale of more than 600,000 Wisconsin deer licenses shows that Wisconsin’s hunters are the “eighth largest army in the world.”","You might not picture a troop of Wisconsin deer hunters when thinking about global military powers, but some social media users are out to change that.  ""There were over 600,000 hunters this season in the state of Wisconsin,"" read a 2021 Facebook post. ""Allow me to restate that number: 600,000! Over the last several months, Wisconsin’s hunters became the eighth largest army in the world."" The post went on to claim that although 600,000 people were ""deployed to the woods of a single American state, Wisconsin, to hunt with firearms … NO ONE WAS KILLED.""  The post began amassing more shares in recent days following a series of deadly mass shootings around the U.S. In addition to Wisconsin, the post said that 750,000 people hunted in Pennsylvania and another 700,000 people hunted in Michigan — all of whom took to the woods and later ""returned home safely."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The sweeping claims overstate what can be learned from deer hunting licenses and overlook what we know about the comparative size of military forces around the world. Wisconsin reported that 820,299 deer hunting licenses were sold for the 2020 season, which would have been the most recent season when the post was first shared on May 23, 2021. While this number surpasses the 600,000 figure shared in the Facebook post, it included bow and crossbow licenses, not just gun hunting licenses, according to the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. Of the total number of deer licenses sold, 569,203 were for gun privileges, according to the preliminary license sale figures released on Dec. 1, 2020. That’s almost 31,000 people short of the ""army"" of 600,000 deer hunters the Facebook post claimed live in Wisconsin. However, there’s no proof that each of the people who purchased licenses to hunt with firearms in Wisconsin are state residents. Wisconsin sells nonresident licenses for gun deer hunting. The department said nonresident license sales decreased in 2020, likely because of the COVID-19 pandemic, but did not give an indication of the usual number of these sales.  The department did not respond to PolitiFact’s request for finalized numbers or information about the number of Wisconsin residents who hunt with firearms. The Facebook post also inflated the number of deer hunters in Michigan. Ed Golder, a spokesperson for the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, said that in 2020, Michigan had 616,235 unique deer hunters, or individuals who bought a deer license of any type for the season. Nearly 80% of them — or 488,422 hunters — participated in the regular firearm deer season, Golder said. We did not find data on the number of deer hunters in Pennsylvania in 2020, and the Pennsylvania Game Commission did not respond to PolitiFact’s information request. The post was also incorrect by suggesting that ""no one died"" while hunting. In Wisconsin, there were 18 hunting-related gun incidents that included one death during the 2020 hunting season. In Michigan in 2020, there were six hunting-related gun injuries, including two fatalities. The most recent incident report available for Pennsylvania was from 2019, when 21 hunting-related gun incidents were reported, including three deaths. Even if 600,000 armed hunters lived in Wisconsin, the group wouldn’t constitute a strikingly large global force, as the post claimed. There aren’t many country-by-country comparisons of military force size, but 2021 data from the International Institute for Strategic Studies indicates that more than 10 countries have at least 1 million military personnel. An army of 600,000 wouldn’t make the top 15 largest military forces when comparing estimated total military personnel, according to 2022 data from Global Firepower, an organization that evaluates military strength and assigns countries rankings. Global Firepower’s data shows that more than 10 countries have forces in which the total number of military personnel is estimated to exceed 1 million. This includes the organization’s highest-ranked militaries overall: the U.S., Russia and China.

There’s also no indication that each of the roughly 569,000 gun deer licenses sold were sold to residents of the state. Some were sold to non-residents. Even if Wisconsin had 600,000 deer hunters who use firearms, the group would not be the eighth largest army in the world",False,"June 6, 2022"
The U.S. Justice Department “conservatively estimated that guns are used 1.5 million times per year to save lives.”,"House Democrats are moving forward with a bill that would enact new restrictions on guns. During a recent hearing, Republican Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona said the bill would fail to reduce crime or make the U.S. safer. ""Millions of Americans safely and responsibly own and use guns,"" Biggs said in the June 2 hearing. ""The Department of Justice under Democratic administrations have done their studies and conservatively estimated that guns are used 1.5 million times per year to save lives."" We contacted Biggs’ office to get the source behind that figure of 1.5 million lives saved by guns and did not hear back. The figure matches one used in a 2008 blog post by the group Gun Owners of America. That post linked to 1997 research published by the department’s National Institute of Justice. The research doesn’t say what Biggs presented. It talks about the defensive use of firearms, but it is silent about any lives saved. In many cases, lives were never at risk. The department’s research was based on a 1994 national telephone survey on gun ownership. If someone said they owned a gun, they were asked, ""Within the past 12 months, have you yourself used a gun, even if it was not fired, to protect yourself or someone else, or for the protection of property at home, work, or elsewhere?"" If they said they had, then they were asked up to 30 additional questions to determine the circumstances around the incident, such as where the incident took place, or if they had seen the person who they felt was a threat. Out of about 2,500 people reached, 45 people said they had used a gun for protection. After filtering out those who could not name the specific criminal threat they faced or had not seen the person they thought was a threat, 19 responses remained. Applying that fraction to the entire U.S. adult population, researchers estimated that guns were used defensively 1.5 million times a year. There’s a hot debate over whether that number is too high or too low, and what it might be today. Before we examine that, there’s one point on which independent researchers agree: The number does not represent the number of lives saved. Philip Cook, professor emeritus of public policy studies at Duke University and co-author of the Justice Department’s research article, said he was confident ""that there were not 1.5 million lives saved in 1994 through defensive gun uses."" ""Many of the crimes being defended against would not have been fatal even without gun defense,"" Cook said. The people who study this area of gun use say that in the surveys, it’s impossible to know what would have happened if someone had not had a firearm.  That’s why researchers wrestle with understanding the circumstances when people have used guns for protection. In a 2000 report, a group of researchers interviewed people who, in a random survey, reported using a gun defensively. They did not find examples when a gun saved someone’s life.  In one case, a man said, ""My alarm at my business went off so I went there to shut it off. Two men were outside my building, so from my car I shot at the ground near them.""  Another told researchers, ""Someone broke in; I woke up to the sound. I got my gun from the safe (loaded it) and went downstairs. The person left and I called the police."" This person didn’t know if the burglar had a weapon. The burglar could have been armed, and the resident could have avoided a potentially deadly encounter. But the data doesn’t reveal the answer. Around the same time as Cook’s research, Gary Kleck, now professor emeritus of criminology at Florida State University, conducted his own survey, asking very similar questions. Kleck estimated that guns were used defensively about 2.5 million times a year. But Kleck distinguished that from saving lives. ""I am not aware of any scientifically based estimates of lives saved,"" Kleck said. This said, stories appear in the news about people who have stopped shooters. To take a recent example, in late May 2022, a woman in Charleston, West Virginia, shot and killed a man who began firing an AR-15-style rifle into a crowd. It doesn’t take much of a leap of faith to conclude that the woman’s actions saved lives. The latest survey of gun owners and their use of firearms estimated that in 2021, guns were used 1.67 million times to protect people or property. That is consistent with the Justice Department study from 25 years ago. But it doesn’t prove that each use saved lives. In 2018, researchers at Rand Corp., a nonprofit consulting group, explored the studies that had been done on guns and self-protection and found a field rife with challenges. ""We conclude that the existing evidence for any causal effect of defensive gun use on reducing harm to individuals or society is inconclusive,"" the authors wrote. One issue was a reliance on self-reporting, with no opportunity for independent confirmation. Surveys try to reduce this problem by including questions to ferret out inconsistent responses, but it’s not perfect. There is a running dispute over whether surveys aimed at detecting the defensive use of firearms over or undercount the actual events. The Rand group came down on the side of those who said that these surveys exaggerate defensive gun use. They also said that another widely cited survey, the annual National Crime Victimization Survey, might undercount defensive gun use. That survey suggested that guns were used about 116,000 a year.  Biggs said that the Justice Department ""conservatively estimated that guns are used 1.5 million times per year to save lives."" The Justice Department published a report with the 1.5 million figure, but that was an estimate of the number of times people used guns to protect themselves, their families or their property. The author said the research did not find that the use was to save lives. Another prominent gun researcher said he knows of no ""scientifically based estimates of lives saved."" A review of this kind of gun research concluded that there is no conclusive evidence that defensive gun use reduces harm to people. The Justice Department’s article did not say what Biggs stated",False,"June 6, 2022"
“The leading cause of death among children is a firearm.”,"Are firearms the leading cause of death in children?  In a speech on the Senate floor, Majority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., recounted details of two recent mass shootings, one in a Buffalo supermarket and the other at Robb Elementary in Uvalde, Texas. He called on his colleagues to tighten the nation’s gun laws. ""America doesn’t stand out when it comes to the rate of mental illness, but we are unique among the world’s developed nations in that today the leading cause of death among children is no longer a car accident, is no longer illness or malnourishment. The leading cause of death among children is a firearm,"" Schumer said.  Schumer is correct, depending on you define children, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and analyses from researchers at three academic centers.  The CDC publishes data on the leading causes of death among different demographic groups, providing the most reliable data. In 2020, the leading cause of death among children ages one through 18 involved a firearm. There were 3,219 such deaths in 2020, followed by motor vehicle traffic deaths, of which there were 2,882.  In their report about gun violence, ""A Year in Review: 2020 Gun Deaths in the U.S.,"" researchers at the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions analyzed CDC data from 2020 and found that gun violence was the leading cause of death among children, teens, and young adults under age 25. Firearms were also the leading cause of death for children and teens ages 1 to 19, taking the lives of 4,357 young people, they wrote.  The report also found that gun violence claimed more lives in 2020, more than 45,000, than it had during any year on record.   Researchers at the Rockefeller Institute of Government, Leigh Wedenoja and Jaclyn Schildkraut, used CDC data, and found that if ""children"" are defined as people 19 and under, as they said the CDC tends to do, then firearm deaths exceed traffic deaths. Their analysis did not take into account infant-specific types of deaths, such as congenital abnormalities or short gestation.  Rockefeller and Johns Hopkins researchers said that when analyzing the leading causes of death among ""children,"" infants are typically not included because of certain fatal conditions unique to children under a year old.  If infants are included, rankings of the leading causes of death for children up to age 18 change. Congenital abnormalities are the leading cause of death in infants, and surpass the number of firearm deaths among all children up to age 18. In 2020, there were 4,403 deaths from congenital abnormalities, 3,141 deaths from short gestation, or preterm birth and low birth weight, and 1,389 deaths from sudden infant death syndrome. There were 11 infant deaths caused by a firearm in 2020.    We approached Schumer’s office, and Director of Communications Justin Goodman said the office relied on a letter in the New England Journal of Medicine, written by researchers at the University of Michigan, as its source. The researchers wrote that among children and adolescents, defined as people ages 1 to 19, firearms overtook motor vehicle crashes as the leading cause of death in 2020.  ""From 2019 to 2020, the relative increase in the rate of firearm-related deaths of all types (suicide, homicide, unintentional, and undetermined) among children and adolescents was 29.5% — more than twice as high as the relative increase in the general population,"" they wrote.   Schumer claimed that the leading cause of death among children is a firearm.  Among children between the ages of one and 18, and ages one and 19, this is true, based on several analyses of CDC data, the leading source for data regarding causes of death.  There are significant causes of death unique to babies up to a year old, such as congenital abnormalities, which is why researchers typically don’t include infants when studying causes of death among children and adolescents",Mostly True,"June 4, 2022"
"With the $53 billion spent in Ukraine aid, the U.S. “could pay five SWAT members $80,000 each and have them at EVERY school front door.”","After the mass school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, some people on social media have called for hardening schools with armed officers. One post even suggested hiring a SWAT team for each school. ""We've sent $53,000,000,000 to Ukraine. That's $404,796 per school. You could pay 5 SWAT members $80,000 each and have them at EVERY school front door. With almost $5k left over. They don't care about you … or your kids. Get angry,"" a photo shared on Facebook on May 26 claimed. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) With about 130,930 public and private K-12 schools in the U.S., the math posited in this post works out. But the claim’s premise lacks context. Over the past two decades, more and more schools have opted to bolster their security measures. The amount of public schools with security cameras increased from 19% in 1999 to 91% in 2020, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. The number of schools with locked or monitored building doors also went up during that time. While school budgets vary by state and school district, an estimated $2.7 billion was spent on U.S. school security equipment and services in 2017, according to Omdia, a market-research company. And billions more are spent each year to pay school resource officers, The Washington Post reported. Following the 2018 mass school shooting in Parkland, Florida, spending on school safety programs increased by $960 million across at least 26 states, according to education news site The 74. The federal government also allocated an additional $2.3 billion to school safety that year. The premise of the claim also falls short in that research shows no evidence that arming teachers — or in this case, hiring a SWAT team for each school — will protect students in future gun-related incidents. Following the tragedy in Uvalde, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, falsely claimed that having armed law enforcement on campus is ""the most effective tool for keeping kids safe."" But researchers and experts say that when it comes to preventing school shootings, there appears to be more evidentiary support for efforts that emphasize early intervention and support for students than there is for having armed law enforcement on campus. Two weeks after Russia’s invasion began, Congress approved a $13.6 billion aid package to arm and equip Ukrainian forces and provide humanitarian and economic assistance to the region. Then, on May 19, as the invasion neared the three-month mark, the Senate voted 86-11 to approve the largest military and humanitarian aid package for the country to date, bringing the total spending to more than $53 billion. The $40 billion aid package included: About $24 billion to help Ukrainian forces finance weapons purchases, to replenish stocks of U.S. equipment sent to the country and to pay for U.S. troops deployed in nearby countries; More than $13 billion in humanitarian assistance and economic support for Ukraine and other countries affected by the war. With bipartisan support, the aid package was designed to sustain Ukraine for months, rather than weeks, as was the goal of the initial funding. Half of all public K-12 schools in the country already employ law enforcement or school resource officers who routinely carry firearms, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. Those in favor of having these armed officers at schools see them as the first line of defense against shooters and other threats. But the consensus among many experts is that armed officers don’t prevent mass school shootings. A 2021 study published by JAMA Network, the American Medical Association’s open access journal, analyzed mass school shootings from 1980 to 2019. The study found the data suggested ""no association between having an armed officer and deterrence of violence in these cases."" Another 2021 study by the Rand Corp., a nonprofit research organization, and the University at Albany, evaluated data from schools between 2014 and 2018 to determine the impact of school resource officers. It found that while school resource officers can protect students from some forms of violence, like physical attacks and fights, there is ""no evidence that SROs prevent school shootings or reduce more serious firearm-related offenses."" In 2018, the Rand Corp. launched a research initiative analyzing thousands of scientific studies to determine the effectiveness of 18 different U.S. gun policies. Through this, Rand found inconclusive evidence that any of these policies, including laws that allow armed staff at K-12 schools, have increased or decreased mass shootings. Research and experts say there is no simple solution. One approach, though, is for schools to have effective early intervention and support systems for students who are experiencing distress. Students tend to show a range of concerning behaviors as their actions escalate to violence. A 2021 study by the U.S. Secret Service concluded that threat assessment — in other words, learning how to recognize behavioral warning signs and intervening effectively — is the best way to prevent targeted school violence. The Educator’s School Safety Network recommends schools take a comprehensive, all-hazards approach to planning for, preventing and responding to violent incidents. This includes threat assessment and security measures, as well as looking for potential vulnerabilities within the school and its daily operations. Often, there is ""a big discrepancy between what the school has written down as a policy or procedure and what they actually do on a day-to-day basis,"" said Amy Klinger, co-founder of the Educator’s School Safety Network. ""And that big discrepancy is a safety issue not just for active shooter (events), but for all kinds of potential safety issues."" A Facebook post claimed that with the $53 billion spent in Ukraine aid, the U.S. ""could pay five SWAT members $80,000 each and have them at EVERY school front door."" The U.S. has allocated about $53 billion in aid to Ukraine. And if one wanted to pay this amount to station five SWAT members at every public and private K-12 school in the country, it would also add up to about $53 billion over one year. But that statement alone lacks context about current security funding for schools and what research shows about the effect of such measures. More than $2.7 billion is already spent each year on school safety equipment and services nationwide. And this $53 billion, if spent as the claim suggested, would cover just one year of SWAT team coverage for schools. Additionally, research shows that the presence of armed officers on campuses does not help prevent school shootings from happening",Half True,"June 3, 2022"
"""We need to realize that people who think that ‘well, maybe if we could just implement tougher gun laws, it’s going to solve it,’ Chicago and LA and New York disprove that thesis.""","Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, after a mass shooting at an elementary school in his state, pointed to Chicago as an example of how ""real gun laws"" fail to protect school children and teachers from shootings. ""I hate to say this, but there are more people who were shot every weekend in Chicago than there are in schools in Texas,"" he said during a nationally televised news conference the day after the shooting. ""We need to realize that people who think that ‘well, maybe if we could just implement tougher gun laws, it’s going to solve it,’ Chicago and LA and New York disprove that thesis. And so, if you’re looking for a real solution, Chicago teaches that what you’re talking about is not a real solution."" Abbott’s remarks came amid the most recent flurry of demands for tougher gun laws after a gunman at Robb Elementary in Uvalde, Texas, killed 19 fourth graders and two teachers on May 24. Abbott’s remarks also recalls a long-repeated Republican talking point that Chicago has the toughest gun laws in the nation. It doesn’t. PolitiFact has fact-checked multiple claims on this point. In every case, the reporting has shown Chicago and Illinois do not have the strictest laws compared to other states, although they are tougher than in Texas. Federal court decisions have loosened once-tough restriction, and many experts agree additional reform could have a positive impact. Since it is difficult to parse Abbott’s comparison of all Chicago shootings to shootings in Texas schools — or statewide Texas shooting deaths to various cities — we decided to compare statewide statistics, which in each state he mentioned are influenced most by urban gun violence. Abbott nor his communications staff returned a request for comment for this fact-check. Chicago’s reputation for strict gun laws is rooted in its 1982 ban on handguns. By 2010, it was the only major city left with a blanket handgun ban. But the ban was struck down in 2010 in the U.S. Supreme Court ruling McDonald v. City of Chicago, which called such outright bans a violation of the Second Amendment to the Bill of Rights. That decision left intact the statewide ban on concealed firearms until two years later when an appeals court declared that unconstitutional as well. Illinois then joined every other state in the nation in allowing licensed citizens to carry concealed firearms. In 2016, then-presidential candidate Donald Trump claimed that Chicago had the toughest gun laws in the United States and more gun violence than any other city. That was Mostly False. The fact check said cities like New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco do more to regulate the concealed-carry permitting process, while Illinois simply processes applications through the Illinois State Police. Despite the 2010 and 2012 court rulings, Illinois still has tougher gun restrictions than Texas. According to Giffords Law Center, an organization which advocates for gun control, Illinois requires universal background checks, gun owner licensing, lost and stolen firearm reporting, waiting periods and has minimum age laws, open carry reporting, community violence intervention funding, risk protection orders and domestic violence gun laws. Texas has none of those. The state does however, have child access prevention laws, which Illinois also has. Gifford’s gave Illinois an A- ranking on its 2021 Annual Gun Law Scorecard — meaning the state has strong laws to reduce the risk of gun-related crimes. Giffords said that while some changes were made in 2020, Illinois as a whole can take measures to improve gun control. Those improvements include: Prohibiting the sale of large-capacity magazines and enacting a gun accountability law. The gun control group also suggested Illinois could ban the manufacturing and selling of ""ghost guns,"" firearms that law enforcement can’t track because they lack serial numbers — an issue Illinois has since addressed in state law enacted this year. Giffords gave Texas an F rating for weak gun laws, along with Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana. The only neighboring state with a better grade is New Mexico with a C. At the same time, Illinois and Texas are roughly the same when it comes to gun deaths per capita, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2020, Illinois reported 14.1 gun-related deaths per 100,000, compared to Texas’ 14.2 rate, according to the latest available CDC data. Experts interviewed by the BGA suggest Abbott’s comparison to gun laws in Texas and Chicago are inherently misleading because gun laws in nearby states — such as Indiana and Wisconsin — more resemble those in Texas where less stringent gun laws allow easier access. ""Many factors determine the rates of homicide and violent crime from city to city,"" said Daniel Webster, a co-director of Johns Hopkins’ Center for Gun Violence Solutions. ""You assess the impact of policies by examining changes in homicides and violent crime after gun laws are enacted and contrast that with changes in places that didn’t adopt the policies."" A 2017 Gun Trace Report released by the Chicago Police Department shows the majority of illegal guns came to Chicago from Indiana and outside of Chicago’s city limits. ""The majority of illegally used or possessed firearms recovered in Chicago are traced back to states with less regulation over firearms, such as Indiana and Mississippi,"" the report said. ""More than two of every five traceable crime guns recovered in Chicago originate with their first point of sale at an Illinois dealer."" The remaining 60% of firearms come from out of state, with Indiana as the primary source for one out of every five crime guns. ""This pattern also highlights Chicago’s challenge to address illegal guns within the loosely-regulated national gun market,"" the report said. Abbott’s claim also falls short when it comes to his comparisons to California and New York. In 2020, both California and the state of New York had lower gun death rates than did Texas. Both California and New York have tougher gun laws than Texas, and both are surrounded by states with tougher gun laws compared to a large portion of the rest of the country. Gifford’s classifies California as having the strongest gun laws in the nation. Abbott said Chicago, New York City and LA are all examples of how tough gun laws do not work. While Chicago’s gun laws may be more strict than some states, Abbott’s statement ignores how regulations have been weakened after federal court reversals of the city’s once-tougher restrictions. He also ignores how the majority of firearms in Chicago are coming from neighboring states where gun laws more reflect those of his own state, illustrating the impact of the lack of national regulation.  States like New York and California with lower gun death rates are for the most part surrounded by states with tougher gun laws",Mostly False,"June 3, 2022"
"Active shooter drill at high school in Uvalde, Texas, two months before the elementary school shooting shows the event was a false flag.","Active shooter drills are pervasive in American schools. Although there is growing concern that active shooter drills increase students’ anxiety, school shootings like the one at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, often prompt calls for more active shooter drills.  Many states, including Texas, require schools to run active shooter drills. About 95% of American public schools conduct lockdown drills, according to U.S. Education Department data.  Despite this, some social media users claim that the Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District’s active shooter trainings somehow prove that the elementary school shooting was a ""false flag"" attack. ""So let me get this straight,"" said a man in a TikTok video also posted to Instagram on May 26. ""They conducted an active shooter drill at the high school in the same town two months prior, and then magically, they had a shooting at the elementary school."" The video featured eerie background music and a New York Post article with the headline, ""Chilling images show students at Salvador Ramos’ HS pretending to be dead during active-shooter drill.""  Authorities have said that 18-year-old Ramos killed at least 19 students and two teachers at the elementary school on May 24. A law enforcement officer killed Ramos at the scene. Authorities are still investigating the shooting. The post containing the video was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Taken in its totality, the video suggests that an active shooter drill at Uvalde High School in March is evidence that the elementary school shooting was a ""false flag"" attack. That’s a baseless claim. The term ""false flag"" refers to harmful actions that are designed to look as if they were perpetrated by one person or group, but were committed by someone else. Unfounded claims often circulate after mass shootings suggesting that the attacks were ""false flags"" devised by the government in an effort to enact gun control laws. In March, the school district’s police department said the goal of an active shooter training at the high school that month was ""to train every Uvalde area law enforcement officer so that we can prepare as best as possible for any situation that may arise."" The man in the TikTok video also said a police officer who was part of the training was married to one of the teachers killed. That is true, but not indicative of a ""false flag"" operation. Uvalde is home to about 15,000 people. ""Everyone knows everybody,"" Uvalde resident Tim Wiginton told Canada’s CBC on May 26. ""So whether you were directly impacted (by the school shooting) or you know someone who was there, whose kids were there, first responders who responded — everyone knows someone that was connected with it."" A video shared on Instagram claimed an active shooter drill at Uvalde High School two months before the Robb Elementary School shooting shows the event was a ""false flag."" This is not true. Active shooter trainings are common in schools across America.

""It was a parent and spouse of a 4th grade teacher, he just happened to be a border patrol agent.""

According to a report by the New York Times, which the Newsweek article cites, Albarado rushed to the school with a borrowed shotgun and, working with other officers, helped evacuate children. But neither article said Albarado was the one who shot and killed Salvador Ramos, the 18-year-old gunman. Law enforcement credited a tactical team for that, though they haven’t named the people involved.  Albarado appeared on ""Today"" on May 31 and confirmed that he wasn’t on duty and didn’t have any gear but said he helped evacuate children from outside.

The New York Times included an excerpt about Albarado’s actions in a May 26 story about Uvalde parents who were furious about law enforcement’s delayed response. The Justice Department is reviewing police actions that day. The story said that Albarado was about to get a haircut when he received a text from his wife, Trisha, a fourth-grade teacher at Robb Elementary, who told him there was an active shooter and asked for help.  Albarado sped to the school with the barber’s shotgun, the story said. Once he arrived, he learned that a tactical team was forming to go inside the wing with the gunman. ""So Mr. Albarado quickly made a plan with other officers at the scene: evacuate as many children as possible,"" the Times reported. ""Two officers provided cover, guns drawn, he said, and two others guided the children out on the sidewalk."" The story never said Albarado was the one who killed Ramos. On the contrary, it says that a tactical team shot and killed Ramos after breaching the classroom.  But that didn’t stop the social media version of events from taking off. In another version of the claim, Albarado was ""first in the line of fire"" and cleared every ""wing of the school"" before busting down the door to the room where Ramos was and killing him.  Albarado appeared on ""Today"" to talk about what happened at the school. He told anchor Savannah Guthrie that he didn’t have any gear and wasn’t on duty, so he didn’t go inside the school.  ""I met up with one of the officers there, trying to see what was going on, I tried to make my way toward the door. Like I said, I didn’t have any of my gear, I was off duty, so I didn’t go in,"" Albarado said in the May 31 interview. As he was helping kids evacuate outside the building, Albarado said his wife contacted him and told him she made it out and that his daughter was across the street at the funeral home.  Albarado said he went to make sure his daughter was safe and then continued to help. He said he didn’t know where Ramos was at the time or whether he was still in the building.  In a May 27 news conference, Texas Department of Public Safety director Steven McCraw described how Uvalde police officers, Border Patrol agents and other law enforcement assembled in the hallway of the school, eventually breaching the room where Ramos was located around 12:51 p.m.  ""They killed the suspect,"" McCraw said. Ramos was killed approximately one hour and 20 minutes after he first entered the school.  A Facebook post claims that off-duty Border Patrol agent Jacob Albarado shot and killed the Uvalde school shooter. This post misrepresents what Albarado and law enforcement have said transpired at the school. While Albarado is a Border Patrol agent who helped with the evacuation effort while off-duty, he said he did not go inside the school. And law enforcement has not indicated he was part of the tactical team that killed Ramos inside the school",False,"May 31, 2022"
TV interviews with two different men who are each identified as Uvalde victim's father show the Robb Elementary School mass shooting was staged.,"Television interviews with two different men — each identified as the father of a mass shooting victim in Uvalde, Texas — have many on social media falsely claiming or insinuating that they are crisis actors and the shooting was staged.

A picture of her that circulated after the shooting showed her proudly holding a certificate for making the school’s A/B honor roll, an award given during a ceremony that had been held earlier in the day. Amerie’s grandmother told The Daily Beast that her granddaughter was shot as she tried to call 911 after gunman Salvador Ramos entered the fourth-grade classroom. On May 25, CNN’s Anderson Cooper interviewed a man named Angel Garza about the girl’s death.

The next day, NBC aired an interview between journalist Savannah Guthrie and a man named Alfred Garza III, who was also identified in that segment as the girl’s father. Alfred Garza described waiting six hours after the shooting to learn whether his daughter was alive or not. An obituary clears up the confusion. It describes Amerie as a caring, sweet and sassy child who liked to swim and draw. It also lists Alfred Garza III as the child’s father and Angel Garza as her stepfather. A GoFundMe set up by a family friend refers to ""both of Amerie’s fathers, Angel and Alfred."" CNN did not respond to PolitiFact’s request for comment about the way Angel Garza was identified in the May 26 segment, but two separate CNN articles posted on May 27 and May 29 refer to both men, citing Alfred Garza as the girl’s father and Angel Garza as her stepfather. The edited video that appeared in the tweet made the rounds on social media, and could be found on YouTube, Twitter and Bitchute, as well as Facebook and Rumble accounts belonging to conservatice commentator Charlie Kirk. A ""false flag,"" which often follows mass shootings, is an event designed to make it look like it was done by one person or group but was actually done by another. There have been real ""false flags"" throughout history, but more often than not in recent years, baseless assertions have spread widely on social media after horrific events, such as the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, that killed 26 people, 20 of them children. Fueled by conspiracy theorists such as Alex Jones, these hoaxes are premised on the idea that these attacks were staged or planned to prompt gun control legislation. In 2018, these unfounded claims earned PolitiFact’s Lie of the Year designation after the internet shared and reshared hoaxes suggesting a mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, was nothing but political theater. It was not. Seventeen people died. A tweet said that the Uvalde, Texas, school shooting was staged and cited as evidence separate TV news interviews showing two different men being identified as the father of a child shot to death in her classroom. However, the explanation is much simpler: One man was the child’s biological father and the other was her stepfather.

"In 2013, under a Democratic Senate, ""a majority of the Senate voted in favor of"" gun-related legislation sponsored by Republican Sens. Chuck Grassley and Ted Cruz, “but the Democrats filibustered it.”","Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, has long opposed restrictive gun legislation. After the May 24 school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, Cruz appeared on Fox News to discuss what had happened and what should be done on gun policy.  Among other things, Cruz blamed Democrats for blocking what he said were reasonable gun regulations in 2013, not long after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut. In the interview, Cruz cited an amendment he sponsored along with Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa: ""In 2013, I introduced legislation called Grassley-Cruz which targeted felons and fugitives and those with serious mental illness. It directed the Department of Justice to do an audit of federal convictions to make sure felons are in the database. It directed the Department of Justice to prosecute and put in jail felons and fugitives who try to illegally buy firearms.  ""In the Harry Reid Democrat(ic) Senate, a majority of the Senate voted in favor of Grassley-Cruz, but the Democrats filibustered it. They demanded 60 votes. They defeated it, because they wanted to go after law-abiding citizens instead of stopping the bad guys."" I’m going to keep fighting to target felons and fugitives who try to buy firearms.We need to stop bad guys from getting guns, not law-abiding citizens. pic.twitter.com/q7zFfC0Hwp Was that accurate?  A review of the legislative wrangling from 2013 shows that Cruz accurately explained the voting on the Grassley-Cruz amendment. However, Cruz is wrong to suggest that only Democrats were to blame for the amendment’s failure. Cruz’s statement leaves out his own party’s use of the very same tool — the 60-vote requirement to break a filibuster — to block other measures that were able to secure majority support in the chamber. In seeking to enact legislation after Sandy Hook, the then-majority leader, Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., established a 60-vote threshold on all amendments to his Safe Communities, Safe Schools Act of 2013. Reid’s technique — allowing a fixed number of amendments for both sides, each requiring a 60-vote majority for passage — has become common in the Senate in recent years, said Steven S. Smith, a political scientist at Washington University in St. Louis and author of ""The Senate Syndrome: The Evolution of Procedural Warfare in the Modern U.S. Senate."" It usually happens like this: The minority party makes clear they’re going to filibuster an underlying bill, as Republicans did with the gun legislation backed by the Democratic leadership in 2013. To counter this filibuster threat, the majority leader uses a procedural maneuver to block the minority from offering any amendments.  This inevitably produces a stalemate. The usual way of resolving this stalemate is for each side to agree to vote on a limited number of amendments, each with a stiff 60-vote threshold. ""Sounds crazy, right?"" Smith said. ""It is, but it gives senators on both sides an opportunity to offer alternatives and put senators on the record."" The parameters for debate and voting are set in motion by the majority leader’s ""unanimous consent"" request. If any senator objects to the majority leader’s request, the voting plan doesn’t go forward. But as long as no one objects, the votes on amendments can proceed, with the supermajority threshold. An important point Cruz leaves out is that every Republican accepted Reid’s ground rules. The Senate’s makeup at the time was 55 Democrats and 45 Republicans. Ultimately, when the voting was held on April 17, 2013, nine amendments received a vote. A few that were relatively uncontroversial passed with a 60-vote supermajority, while a few fell short of even a simple 50-vote majority. The Cruz-Grassley amendment attracted majority support, but not 60 votes. It received a vote of 52-48, with nine Democrats voting for it (Max Baucus and Jon Tester of Montana, Mark Begich of Alaska, Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Kay Hagan of North Carolina, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, Claire McCaskill of Missouri, Mark Pryor or Arkansas) and two Republicans voting against (Mark Kirk of Illinois and Mike Lee of Utah). The same day, the Senate voted on an amendment sponsored by Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Pat Toomey, R-Pa., that would have toughened background checks for purchasing guns.  The Manchin-Toomey amendment, which was backed by the Democratic leadership, also received a majority vote (54-46) but it, too, fell short of the 60 votes required for passage. It attracted two more votes than Grassley-Cruz did. Four Republicans joined most Democrats in supporting Manchin-Toomey — Susan Collins of Maine, Kirk, John McCain of Arizona, and Toomey. Five Democrats joined Republicans in opposition: Baucus, Begich, Heitkamp, Pryor, and Reid. (Reid’s vote against it was not due to the substance of the measure but rather as a procedural tactic that would allow him to call the amendment up at a later date.) Meanwhile, two other amendments secured majority support but fell short of 60 votes. One focused on firearm trafficking and was sponsored by Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt. It resulted in a 58-42 vote. Another amendment that addressed veterans’ gun rights was sponsored by Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C. It produced a 56-44 vote. Steve Guest, a special advisor for communications with Cruz, said the senator’s statement was ""absolutely correct.""  Guest said it is ""disingenuous to say that somehow the blame is on both sides of the aisle for filibustering Grassley-Cruz. The fact of the matter is Grassley-Cruz would have passed had over 80% of the Democrats in the Senate not blocked it via the filibuster."" This recording of history is incomplete, however. Reid set the 60-vote threshold in response to Republican threats to filibuster the Democratic measure, meaning that both sides were playing the same game. And to get out of the standoff, Republicans unanimously agreed to the 60-vote threshold Reid established for all amendments.  This endgame has been common since the 1990s, Smith said, creating a system where senators on either side can avoid accountability by taking votes that have no chance of passage but serve the party’s campaign messaging. ""Senators can make all kinds of claims that are half-truths, and the public cannot possibly make sense of it,"" Smith said. Cruz said that in 2013, under a Democratic Senate, ""a majority of the Senate voted in favor of"" the Grassley-Cruz amendment to tighten background checks, ""but the Democrats filibustered it."" This retelling is accurate up to a point, but it leaves out half the story.  Reid set a 60-vote threshold for all amendments because the Republicans’ made their own filibuster threats against what the Democrats wanted to pass. To get out of the standoff, Republicans unanimously agreed to the 60-vote threshold for all amendments.  The Cruz-Grassley amendment attracted majority support, but not 60 votes. The same was true of the Democratic-backed Manchin-Toomey amendment",Half True,"May 27, 2022"
“These mass shootings happen so much that Ted Cruz really got a template ready to tweet whenever they occur.”,"Offers of ""thoughts and prayers"" by U.S. elected officials after mass shootings are often received with criticism — with people claiming the messages are empty and void of any actionable response. After the Uvalde, Texas, school shooting on May 24, some social media users accused Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, of having a response template ready to go whenever a shooting occurs. At least 19 students and two teachers were killed at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde by a man named Salvador Ramos, authorities said. ""These mass shootings happen so much that Ted Cruz really got a template ready to tweet whenever they occur,"" a May 26 tweet said. The tweet shows a wall of screenshots supposedly from Cruz’s Twitter account, with the most recent being about the Uvalde school shooting. Each tweet is almost exactly the same, with the exception of the location of the shooting, making it look as if  Cruz uses the same apologetic message for each tragedy.    This claim is bogus. The tweet Cruz wrote on May 24 about the Uvalde shooting is real, but the rest of the images of the other tweets are fake.  Heidi & I are fervently lifting up in prayer the children and families in the horrific shooting in Uvalde.We are in close contact with local officials, but the precise details are still unfolding.Thank you to heroic law enforcement & first responders for acting so swiftly. A review of Cruz’s Twitter account shows that he has posted different messages following mass shootings. Many do follow similar patterns, with him and his wife offering prayers to the victims and their families, but the posts aren’t copied and pasted like the claim suggests. Examples of some of his tweets:  On May 16, after a gunman killed 10 people at a supermarket in Buffalo, NY, Cruz wrote: ""Heidi & I are praying for the families of the victims of the horrific shooting in Buffalo, NY. The killer must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and brought to justice. The racism & antisemitism that purportedly motivated this killer have no place in America … I’m thankful there are heroes like security guard Aaron Salter, Jr.,  retired police officer, who fought back, and lost his life defending those around him."" On Aug. 3, 2019, after a shooter killed 23 people in a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, Cruz wrote: ""My heart is with everyone in El Paso struck by this unspeakable evil. Heidi & I are praying for the victims & their families & are grateful for the first responders, local authorities & law enforcement working tirelessly to bring the perpetrator of this depraved act to justice."" On June 18, 2015, after a gunman killed nine people at a historic Black church in Charleston, South Carolina, Cruz wrote: ​​""My thoughts and prayers are with the families of the victims of last night's shooting in Charleston",False,"May 27, 2022"
“There hasn't been a single of these mass shootings that have been purchased at a gun show or on the internet.”,"Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said stringent gun regulations would not prevent crimes like the May 24 shooting in Uvalde, Texas.  ""There hasn't been a single of these mass shootings that have been purchased at a gun show or on the internet,"" Rubio said on May 25. ""If people want to do it, we can have that debate, but don’t link it to these horrible events. They have nothing to do with it."" Rubio told reporters he wouldn’t support expanding background checks for commercial sales, like gun shows, saying that the issue is unrelated to mass shootings.  We wondered whether Rubio’s characterization of where firearms from high-profile shootings were obtained was accurate. Research shows that it’s not.  Rubio did not respond to multiple requests for comment.  A 2015 report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service defined a ""mass public shooting"" as a multiple-homicide incident where four or more victims are murdered with firearms. By that standard, there have been 66 mass public shootings from 1999 to 2013. A more recent analysis from advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety listed 274 mass shootings since 2009.  Contradicting Rubio’s claim, PolitiFact found several instances where a perpetrator of a high-profile shooting obtained their weapons at a gun show or on the internet. In 1999, for example, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold — the people behind the shooting at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado — acquired their firearms at a gun show with the help of an 18-year-old classmate.  At least one of the handguns Seung-Hui Cho used to kill 33  at Virginia Tech in 2007 was purchased online, according to the Virginian-Pilot.

Jody Lee Hunt, a convicted felon, bought a firearm through a private seller on Facebook. In 2014, Hunt used the gun to kill his former girlfriend, a business owner, and two others in West Virginia.  Federal law requires licensed firearm dealers to perform background checks on prospective buyers. However, federal law does not impose that requirement on unlicensed sellers, who generally sell guns online or at gun shows.  It’s worth noting that some licensed firearm dealers do sell online or at gun shows, and they perform background checks on their sales. It’s the seller’s licensing status that determines whether there’s a background check or not. Rubio’s broader point was that expanding the background check requirement to include unlicensed sellers would not prevent a mass shooting, contending that such sales aren’t correlated with such crimes. Experts, however, disagreed with that argument.  John Donohue, a Stanford University law professor who brings a strong data approach to gun crimes, said focusing just on mass shootings misses the larger picture of the crimes where these weapons show up.  ""Everyday murderers and criminals frequently procure their guns without going through background checks,"" Donohue told PolitiFact. ""Because the 18-year-old mass killer in Uvalde purchased his weapon directly from a licensed dealer is not a reason to oppose closing a dangerous loophole in American law."" Rubio said, ""There hasn't been a single of these mass shootings that have been purchased at a gun show or on the internet."" PolitiFact found several instances where the firearms used in a mass shooting were purchased online or at a gun show. A high-profile example includes the 1999 shooting at Columbine High School. Rubio didn’t provide any evidence to support his assertion",False,"May 27, 2022"
"""More people die from hands, fists, feet, than rifles.”","Amid the gun control debate, a data-laden graphic shared on Facebook posits this: rifles are nothing compared with human brawn. ""More people die from hands, fists, feet, than rifles. Guess we should ban limbs now…,"" reads the May 25 post. Underneath, a graphic titled ""Number of murder victims in the Unites States in 2020 by weapon used"" shows rifle deaths at 455 and deaths from ""personal weapons (hands, fists, feet, etc.)"" as 662. The post includes a link to a website called Statista. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) FBI data from 2020 does show that more people died from injuries sustained from other people’s fists, feet and hands than from rifles. But there’s more you should know about that data before you use it to draw conclusions. Statista researchers pulled data from the FBI’s Crime Data explorer, which does show that of the 17,813 homicides reported in 2020, 662 of them were committed with ""personal weapons"" — which the site indeed describes as hands, fists, feet, etc. — and 455 homicides were committed with rifles. So strictly going by the numbers, the post’s claim is accurate, but there are important caveats. The FBI’s numbers also show that of all the homicides reported, 13,663 were committed with firearms of any kind, or about 77%. Only about 4% of homicides overall were from hands, fists and feet. And 4,863 of those gun homicides were committed with firearms of a ""type not stated,"" meaning law enforcement agencies didn't specify in their data reporting which type of gun was used. Enough rifles could be among those to push that total higher than personal weapons — even 5% would do it — though there’s no way to know for certain. The FBI’s data is based on voluntary reporting. Not every law enforcement agency files an expanded homicide report. These statistics are based on reports from 15,875 of 18,623 law agencies, meaning the number of homicides is likely higher. The Centers for Disease Control, for instance, lists 19,384 gun homicides in the U.S. in 2020, based on U.S. death certificate information provided by the National Center for Health Statistics. The FBI statistics show that handguns were used in most of the gun homicides, with 8,029. That’s likely because ""violent crime is typically higher in urban areas than rural ones, and handguns are better suited for urban living,"" said Adam Lankford, a criminology and criminal justice professor at the University of Alabama. Lankford and a colleague did a study in 2020 that found that semiautomatic rifles or assault weapons are increasingly being used in mass shootings.  ""It makes sense that handguns would be used more often than long guns in muggings, gang violence, robberies, or any other form of violence where the perpetrator may try to hide his firearm before and after the crime,"" Lankford said. ""Public mass shooters are less concerned about hiding their firearms because they typically don't expect to escape."" AR-15 or AR-15-style rifles have been used in many high-profile mass shootings, including at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012, a country music concert in Las Vegas in 2017 and the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, in 2018. Such weapons were also used in the two most recent mass shootings in Uvalde, Texas, and Buffalo, New York. Salvador Ramos, the Uvalde gunman who police say killed 19 elementary school students and two teachers on May 24, used an AR-15-style semi-automatic rifle in the attack, one of two rifles he purchased days earlier after his 18th birthday, The Associated Press reported. Payton Gendron, the 18-year-old charged with fatally shooting 10 people in a racially motivated attack at a Buffalo supermarket on May 14, also used an AR-15-style rifle, The Associated Press reported. A Facebook post claimed that more people were killed by hands, fists and feet in 2020 than by rifles.  FBI data does confirm that statistic. But the data source is limited, and the stat alone doesn’t tell the full story of the role firearms of all kinds play in homicides",Mostly True,"May 27, 2022"
“We know from past experiences that the most effective tool for keeping kids safe is armed law enforcement on the campus.”,"Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, has blamed others for politicizing the school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, to advance discussions about gun access. To Cruz, the answer is simpler.  ""We know from past experiences that the most effective tool for keeping kids safe is armed law enforcement on the campus,"" Cruz said in Washington on May 24, just hours after the shooting, before many details were known.  Ted Cruz proposes armed cops in elementary schools to deter school shootings pic.twitter.com/sJ8B6cf9Xd ""Inevitably when there’s a murder of this kind, you see politicians try to politicize it, you see Democrats and a lot of folks in the media whose immediate solution is to try to restrict the constitutional rights of law-abiding citizens. That doesn’t work. It’s not effective. It doesn’t prevent crime."" Is it true that we know from ""past experiences that the most effective tool for keeping kids safe is armed law enforcement on the campus""? No. Whether it’s anecdotal evidence or broad-based research, there is little to support Cruz’s claim. Let’s start with what happened in Uvalde, Texas.  Texas Sen. Ted Cruz arrives at a news conference in Uvalde, Texas, on May 25, 2022. (AP) Officials have offered various and conflicting reports at what happened at Robb Elementary School. On May 25, Director of the Texas Department of Public Safety Steven McCraw said that before 18-year-old Salvador Ramos entered the school and shot and killed at least 19 children and two teachers, he was confronted by a district school resource officer, a common title for armed police officers who work on school grounds. ""There was a brave consolidated independent school district resource officer that approached (Ramos), engaged him and, at that time, gunfire was not exchanged,"" McCraw said. ""The subject was able to make it into the school."" Other media accounts offer some different details about the number of officers and the level of confrontation. And then on May 26, Texas law enforcement officials said Ramos was able to enter the school unobstructed and that a school resource officer was not on scene.  ""He walked in unobstructed initially,"" said Victor Escalon, regional director for the Texas Department of Public Safety. Law enforcement officers ultimately shot and killed Ramos, McCraw said, but not before at least 21 people were killed and 17 additional people were injured.  Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, left, speaks during a roundtable discussion hosted by Texas Gov. Gregg Abbott to address safety and security at Texas schools in the wake of the shooting at Santa Fe, in Austin, Texas, May 24, 2018. (AP) In 2018, in Texas, Cruz responded to another school shooting, this one at Santa Fe High School, in Santa Fe, Texas. In that case, the shooter was confronted by two police officers who were stationed at the school, according to a local sheriff. The officers, one of whom was shot during the attack, ""hemmed the gunman into one classroom and saved lives by drawing his attention and fire,"" the sheriff said. About 30 minutes after the shooting started, the 17-year-old suspect surrendered to law enforcement. A total of 10 people were killed and 13 were wounded. Multiple explosive devices were also found at or near the school, officials said.  The Trace, a nonprofit newsroom that focuses on gun issues, found that in Santa Fe and in three other prominent shootings in 2018 — Kentucky’s Marshall County High School in January; Florida’s Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in February; Maryland’s Great Mills High School in March — ""attackers stormed campuses despite the presence of armed guards."" In each case, guards failed to stop the shooter from killing. Broader research provides not much support for Cruz’s claim that armed law enforcement officers on school grounds are the ""most effective tool"" for keeping kids safe from mass shootings. A 2021 study conducted by researchers from University at Albany and RAND examined data from U.S. schools between 2014 to 2018 to evaluate the impact of school resource officers. It found that school resource officers ""do effectively reduce some forms of violence in schools, but do not prevent school shootings or gun-related incidents."" In addition, that study found that school resource officers appear to protect students from ""a non-trivial number of physical attacks and fights within schools,"" which could have long-term academic and psychological benefits for students. But schools with resource officers also report more suspensions, expulsions, police referrals and student arrests — and those harsher disciplinary punishments disproportionately fall on Black students, male students and students with disabilities. Another 2021 JAMA Network study conducted by researchers at Hamline University and Metropolitan State University in Minnesota examined a total of 133 school shootings and attempted school shootings from 1980 to 2019.  It was limited by the availability of public data and the inability to measure deterred shootings, among other factors, but researchers found that, controlling for other factors such as location, school type and region, the data showed ""armed guards were not associated with significant reduction in rates of injuries"" during school mass shootings. Further, when researchers controlled for location and school characteristic factors, ""the rate of deaths was 2.83 times greater (emphasis added) in schools with an armed guard present."" Pete Blair, the executive director of the Advanced Law Enforcement Rapid Response Training Center at Texas State University, said armed individuals can play a role in stopping school shootings in progress but cautioned against any claim that it’s ""the most effective tool"" or that it prevents school shootings.  In Illinois in 2018, for instance, officials credited an officer with avoiding a potential school shooting involving a student at the school. The shooter’s mother said she thought her son was trying to get the police to kill him. Only the shooter was injured. Blair said the ALERRT Center is part of a group that works with the FBI to release annual active shooter data. The FBI defines an active shooter as ""one or more individuals actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people in a populated area."" That data shows that from 2000 until 2021, there have been 434 active shooter incidents, Blair said. This includes shooter incidents in schools and elsewhere. ""The most common resolution is for the attacker to flee,"" Blair said, which happened in about 25% of all cases. In about the same number of cases, the shooting stopped when a responding on-duty police officer, armed security or off-duty officer shot the attacker, he said. Blair said the data isn’t specific enough to break down whether police officers who used force to stop an attack were already stationed there at the time — as a school resource officer likely would be — or were called in specifically to respond to the incident. Dewey Cornell, a professor of education at the University of Virginia who studies school safety, bullying and student threat assessment, said he has seen research that suggests school resource officers ""can be valuable in building relationships with students and working with threat assessment teams, but not as armed guards protecting the campus from a shooter."" ""I know of no scientific evidence that having armed law enforcement on campus by itself keeps kids safe at school,"" he said. ""We have prevented school shootings by identifying threats and working with troubled students before they make an attack."" PolitiFact found no studies or research that conclusively showed that the presence of armed officers deterred people from targeting schools. ""From a theoretical point of view, it makes sense. Trying to prove it empirically can be difficult,"" Blair said. ""I can’t point to any specific cases and say, here’s this specific case where this person said, they looking at this and they chose not to because there was an armed security guard there.’"" The 2021 JAMA Network study said data suggested ""no association between having an armed officer and deterrence of violence"" in mass shootings from 1980 to 2019.  ""Prior research suggests that many school shooters are actively suicidal, intending to die in the act, so an armed officer may be an incentive rather than a deterrent,"" the study said. Steve Guest, a spokesperson for Cruz, pointed to a 2019 Vox article that referenced 2005 research that suggested increased police presence leads to fewer people committing crimes. The article and research wasn’t looking at school shootings specifically. The spokesperson also referenced a 2018 report that found for 238 middle and high schools in West Virginia, the presence of resource officers ""increases the number of reported incidents related to drug crime as well as the number of out-of-school suspensions for drug crime, but decreases violent crime and disorder when multiple years are considered."" Again, the report wasn’t looking at school shootings specifically. It did say that school resource officers are more likely to work with law enforcement to create a written plan for ""how to deal with shootings."" Cruz said, ""We know from past experiences that the most effective tool for keeping kids safe is armed law enforcement on the campus."" A 2021 JAMA Network study said data found ""no association between having an armed officer and deterrence of violence"" in mass shootings from 1980 to 2019. A 2021 study by the University at Albany and RAND said school resource officers ""do not prevent school shootings or gun-related incidents",False,"May 26, 2022"
"""When we passed the assault weapons ban, mass shootings went down. When the law expired, mass shootings tripled.""","There was no mistaking President Joe Biden’s plea for some sort of concrete response to the slaying of 19 elementary school children and two teachers in Uvalde, Texas. ""I spent my career as a senator and as vice president working to pass common sense gun laws,"" Biden said in a May 24 prime time national address. ""We can’t and won’t prevent every tragedy. But we know they work and have a positive impact. When we passed the assault weapons ban, mass shootings went down. When the law expired, mass shootings tripled."" Biden was thinking back to sweeping gun legislation passed in 1994. Among other changes, it banned certain kinds of weapons, and the large-capacity magazines that allow people to fire more bullets before reloading. There are numbers that back Biden up. A 2019 study out of New York University’s School of Medicine found that mass shooting deaths involving assault weapons fell slightly in the decade of the federal assault weapon ban, and then rose dramatically in the decade that followed. That’s the time frame for Biden’s statement. While other researchers said the decline during the ban was too small to draw firm conclusions about the ban’s impact, there is no debate that the pace and deadliness of mass shootings rose after the ban ended. Beyond assault weapons, more recent work points to the threat posed by large-capacity magazines, which the 1994 law also restricted. The 1994 law barred the ""manufacture, transfer, and possession"" of about 118 firearm models and all magazines holding more than 10 rounds. People who already owned such weaponry could keep it. When the ban took effect, there were roughly 1.5 million assault weapons in private hands. An estimated 25 million weapons were equipped with large-capacity magazines. The ban expired in 2004. In a 2004 study commissioned by the U.S. Justice Department, researcher Christopher Koper wrote, ""The ban’s exemption of millions of pre-ban assault weapons and large capacity magazines ensured that the effects of the law would occur only gradually."" The point was the 1994 law was hardly an on-off switch for these firearms and magazines. As long as that hardware remained in circulation, people who wanted to use these weapons in a mass shooting would have some opportunity to acquire them. In a 2019 study from New York University’s School of Medicine, a group led by epidemiologist Charles DiMaggio homed in on mass shooting deaths. Researchers define mass shootings in different ways. DiMaggio’s group looked at incidents in which at least four people died. In raw numbers, they found that mass shooting deaths fell during the years of the ban, and rose afterwards. DiMaggio shared his data. Deaths more than tripled in the decade after the ban ended. The decline of 15 deaths between the decade before the ban and the decade during it is modest, but there is a clear and dramatic rise after the ban expired.  The death toll from mass shootings went from an average of 4.8 per year during the ban years to an average of  23.8 per year in the decade afterwards. Many factors drive gun deaths. To help account for those, DiMaggio’s team put mass shooting deaths in terms of the total number of firearm homicides. Viewed that way, they found that between 1994 and 2004, the yearly rate fell by 9 people per 10,000 firearm homicides.  DiMaggio’s study concluded that mass shooting deaths were 70% less likely during the ban.  His isn’t the only study to find that fewer people died in mass shootings when the ban was in effect. In a 2019 article, Louis Klarevas, a Columbia University researcher, and his co-authors found that shootings in which six or more people died were less common and less deadly in the years during the ban. The debate over the value of a ban on assault weapons and large-capacity magazines often includes Christopher Koper at George Mason University. Koper wrote the 2004 study that gave both sides in the gun control debate supporting material. Recently, Koper has spent more time assessing the role of large-capacity magazines that hold more than 10 rounds.  In a 2020 article, Koper wrote that more than the semiautomatic weapons themselves, the latest data ties larger magazines to a rising death toll. The most striking trend, he said, is less about the modest fall in deaths under the ban, and more about the dramatic rise that came when the ban ended. Much of that stems from the firepower that comes from large-capacity magazines. ""Considering that mass shootings with high capacity semiautomatics are considerably more lethal and injurious than other mass shootings, it is reasonable to argue that the federal ban could have prevented some of the recent increase in persons killed and injured in mass shootings had it remained in place,"" Koper wrote. Researchers at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health studied state laws that limit magazine size. Their work linked those laws to a nearly 50% reduction in the rate of fatal mass shootings. On the key policy question of whether the ban drove the decline, DiMaggio urged caution. ""It is pretty much impossible to prove cause and effect,"" he told us when his study came out in 2019. Gun violence researcher Andrew Morral at RAND Corporation, a consulting nonprofit research group, said he and his colleagues don’t see strong evidence that the ban drove down deaths.  On the other hand, ""we also don’t believe there is strong evidence that they were not the cause of any such reductions,"" Morral said. Morral said many studies show that limits on weapons and large-capacity magazines are associated with fewer and less deadly mass shootings. And in the absence of stronger data either way, ""logical considerations"" should guide lawmakers. ""The absence of strong scientific evidence is not a good rationale for taking no action,"" Morral said. Biden said that after passage of ""the assault weapons ban, mass shootings went down. When the law expired, mass shootings tripled."" We last looked at a claim like this in 2019, when Bill Clinton said that after the ban on some types of assault weapons passed, ""there was a big drop in mass shooting deaths."" Biden didn’t go that far, and as such, is a bit more accurate.  A key study backs Biden up. But the reality is millions of assault weapons and large-capacity magazines remained in circulation during the ban, and that makes it hard to tease out the law’s impact",Mostly True,"May 25, 2022"

An ICE spokesperson told PolitiFact that it is not carrying out immigration enforcement in Uvalde. A branch of ICE is there to support the investigations. A May 25 statement from the Department of Homeland Security said Uvalde is a ""protected area,"" which means those agencies do not conduct immigration enforcement there during the emergency event.

DHS also said these agencies will provide emergency assistance regardless of a person’s immigration status.

"“90% of Americans, regardless of political party, want universal background checks.”","Golden State Warriors Coach Steve Kerr gave an emotional speech hours after the mass shooting at a Texas elementary school, pleading with lawmakers to pass legislation to expand background checks for gun purchases. ""Do you realize that 90% of Americans, regardless of political party, want background checks, universal background checks? 90% of us,"" Kerr said during a news conference before Game 4 of the NBA Western Conference finals. ""We’re being held hostage by 50 senators in Washington who refuse to even put it to a vote, despite what we, the American people, want. They won’t vote on it, because they want to hold on to their own power. It’s pathetic. I’ve had enough."" Kerr made the comments just before authorities confirmed the number dead at Robb Elementary in Uvalde, Texas, had climbed to 19 children and two adults. Kerr has been a longtime advocate for stricter gun control legislation. His father, Malcolm H. Kerr, president of the American University of Beirut, was assassinated by gunmen in 1984.  At PolitiFact, we have been fact-checking statements at least since 2013 about majority support for gun background checks, and have found them to be generally accurate, although support is typically lower than 90% among Republicans.  Under U.S. law, federally licensed gun dealers, importers and manufacturers must run background checks for sales to unlicensed buyers. The law bans firearm transfers to anyone convicted of a serious crime or committed to a mental institution. But a private seller without a federal license doesn’t need to meet the same requirement.  Kerr’s statement referenced background check legislation that would have extended background checks to private sellers. The legislation allowed only for limited exceptions, such as if the firearm were a gift from a spouse. In March 2021, the House voted in favor of the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2021, H.R. 8. But the bill never received a vote in the 50-50 Senate where Republicans have shown opposition to adding gun control laws. They couldn’t move to a vote which would need 60 senators. The House also passed H.R. 1446, the Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2021. The bill would have expanded the time federal law enforcement would have to conduct background checks on unlicensed people from three days to 10 days before a gun could be transferred to the person’s possession. Senate Republicans blocked the bill. Polling expert Steven Smith at Washington University in St. Louis told us that ""90% — or nearly 90% — support for background checks is a common finding in nationwide surveys."" While polls show majority support among Republicans, it is lower than 90%. As an example, Smith pointed to a 2021 survey by the Pew Research Center that found 92% of Democrats and 70% of Republicans support background checks for private gun sales. Overall support was at 81%. When other pollsters asked Americans if they supported background checks for all sales, they found similar numbers: Quinnipiac in 2021 found 89% overall support, with support among 98% of Democrats and 84% of Republicans. Morning Consult/Politico in 2021 found 84% support overall, including 91% of Democrats and 77% of Republicans. ABC/Washington Post in 2019 found 89% support overall with support at 96% for Democrats and 83% for Republicans. Gallup found 92% overall support in 2018, including 96% of Democrats and 86% of Republicans. The wording for such questions can vary slightly from poll to poll. In an April 2022 poll, The Economist/YouGov asked about requiring ""criminal and mental background checks"" for all gun buyers — a specific phrase we didn’t see regularly in all polls. It found 72% overall either strongly or somewhat favored, while 83% of Democrats and 68% of Republicans held that view. Why the disconnect between what Americans tell pollsters and how Republican lawmakers vote? Part of the answer lies in who shows up to vote in primaries, as well as lobbying by groups that oppose gun restrictions.  ""It is the people who are seen and heard by politicians that matter most,"" Smith said. ""In Republican primaries, anti-gun control voters are almost certainly a salient group that shapes the issue strategies of candidates."" Another factor is the other responses that Americans give to pollsters about guns. Frank Newport, Gallup’s senior scientist, wrote in 2021 that it appears Americans support new gun restrictions even though they are not necessarily convinced doing so will stop mass shootings. A 2018 Pew Research poll showed that Americans were just as likely to say making it harder for people to obtain guns would make no difference in the number of mass shootings as they were to say such action would result in fewer mass shootings. A Gallup poll in 2017 found 58% of Americans believed that new gun laws would have little or no effect on mass shootings. ""In short, I think it is fair to say that Americans recognize that reducing gun deaths is going to require several approaches — increased controls on access to guns and increased focus on the background and mental state of those individuals who take lives using guns,"" Newport wrote. While people support background checks overall, their support seems to drop when they are asked about specific legislation. The National Rifle Association has previously pointed to the results of background check voter referendums in Maine and Nevada in 2016 that showed lower support for background checks than the national polls suggest. In Maine, 52% of voters rejected a background check measure. In Nevada, a background check question just barely passed with about 50.5% of the vote.  The gist of the NRA’s argument is that when people are asked a generic question by a pollster, it leads to a different result than when they actually face a question on a ballot that could affect their own rights. Pew Research Center found in 2013 that 81% of Republicans supported expanded background checks, but when asked if they supported a U.S. Senate bill that included such legislation, Republican support dropped to 57%.  ​​""People may support background checks in general, but become more skeptical when gun rights groups highlight specific complications or unintended consequences that could arise when these laws are implemented,"" Kristin Goss, professor of public policy and political science at Duke University, told us in 2020. Also, it’s possible that some respondents who say they want background checks for all sales may not realize that it is not current federal law — a point backed up by a 2013 poll conducted at the behest of the Democratic National Committee. Of the 50% of people who said they preferred enforcement over new laws, 48% said they thought federal law prohibits gun show sales and private gun sales without background checks. Another 10% disclosed that they didn’t know the rules. ""Most people don’t have a very good grasp of what our gun laws are,"" Goss said. ""To be fair to Americans, gun laws are complicated and vary greatly state by state."" Kerr said ""90% of Americans, regardless of political party, want universal background checks."" Polls during the past few years show overall support for gun background checks in the ballpark of 90%. Kerr suggested the statistic applied regardless of political party, and it clearly does for Democrats, who often support background checks at rates higher than 90%. But among Republicans, we found some polls suggesting their support is closer to the 80% range, slightly less than Kerr suggested",Mostly True,"May 25, 2022"
"“50% of the guns sold in Texas, because of the loopholes, do not pass through a background check.”","In the first hours after the nation’s 27th school shooting this year, Texan and MSNBC commentator Matthew Dowd told viewers that he owns three shotguns and two rifles, and described hunting as part of the culture in Uvalde, Texas.  Then Dowd, a one-time strategist for Republican President George W. Bush who also briefly ran as a Democrat for Texas lieutenant governor in 2021, alluded to laws ""on the books"" and urged support for more gun control. He claimed: ""50% of the guns sold in Texas, because of the loopholes, do not pass through a background check."" We reached out to Dowd through his website, MSNBC and his book publisher, but did not get a reply.  The research director for Giffords, an anti-gun violence organization, and two university gun researchers told PolitiFact they know of no data to support Dowd’s statistical claim about background checks, which are getting renewed attention in Congress in the wake of the May 24 mass shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde that left 19 children and two educators dead.  It was the 27th shooting on K-12 school property in 2022 that resulted in firearm-related injuries or deaths, according to Education Week. Background checks are required in Texas for some gun sales.  Federal law generally requires federally licensed firearms dealers, including those in Texas, to conduct background checks when making gun sales. The federal law does not apply to private sellers, and Texas does not have a law that applies to private sellers, either. In Texas, individuals can also buy guns from a licensed seller without going through a background check if they have a state license to carry a handgun. ""So, there is no source of administrative data that provides a comprehensive estimate of the percentage of gun transactions or guns currently possessed in which there was no National Instant Criminal Background Check System check,"" said Philip Cook, a public policy professor and gun researcher at Duke University. Because some gun sales are not recorded, what’s known about the proportion of gun sales not involving a background check is based on surveys.  But experts said those are national surveys of gun owners and not data based on actual Texas gun sales. Giffords research director Kelly Drane pointed us to a 2017 article in the Annals of Internal Medicine journal that reported a 50% finding about background checks. But it does not back up Dowd’s claim, as it does not address the sale of guns in Texas. The article reported the results of a nationally representative survey of 1,613 gun owners done by researchers from Northeastern and Harvard universities in 2015. The gun owners were asked about where and when they acquired their last firearm, if they purchased it and whether they had a background check.  One finding was that, for firearms purchased privately within the previous two years — that is, other than from a store or pawn shop, including sales between individuals in person, online, or at gun shows — 50% were obtained without a background check. But the study found that private transfers were a minority of all gun transactions. The survey found that among all gun transfers, 22% of gun owners said they obtained their most recent firearm without a background check. A more recent study, published by the same researchers in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, utilized a 2019 nationally representative survey of 2,950 firearm owners. That study also does not back up Dowd’s claim. The study estimated the proportion of firearm transfers that occur without background checks, noting differences in the 21 states that have so-called comprehensive background check laws. Those laws vary, but they require background checks for at least some types of private gun sales or transfers, and for at least some types of guns. The study found that 12% of gun owners in states without comprehensive background checks said that when acquiring their most recent firearm, they did not undergo a background check. That compared with 24% in states with comprehensive background check laws. The survey asked about all gun transfers — sales as well as gifts. The Uvalde gunman legally purchased two AR 15-style rifles at a local federal firearms licensee, according to news reports. Such a licensee would have had to conduct a background check to legally make the sales. Dowd said ""50% of the guns sold in Texas, because of the loopholes, do not pass through a background check."" We could find no data to confirm the claim, and available studies and surveys contradict the idea that such a large percentage of gun buyers in Texas were not subject to a background check",False,"May 25, 2022"
"“Most of these killers tend to be 18, 19 years old.”","Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., has worked to enact restrictions on guns ever since the Sandy Hook school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, an area he then-represented in the U.S. House of Representatives. After another elementary school shooting — this one in Uvalde, Texas, on May 24, 2022 — Murphy gave an impassioned speech on the U.S. Senate floor to urge redoubled efforts to curb gun violence. The speech made the rounds of news shows and was widely shared on social media. In an interview with CNN the day of the shooting, Murphy focused on the young age of the shooters in Uvalde and a May 14 mass shooting in Buffalo. ""I want to get rid of these assault weapons,"" Murphy said. ""But maybe we can find common ground on just limiting who can get access to them, maybe say you have to be 21 instead of 18, seeing that most of these killers tend to be 18, 19 years old."" This fact-check will focus on whether ""most of these killers tend to be 18, 19 years old."" When we checked with Murphy’s office, they pointed to a database project undertaken by The Washington Post that tracks every act of gunfire at a primary or secondary school during school hours since the Columbine High School massacre April 20, 1999. The Post found more than 200 incidents that met the project’s criteria. When the Post analyzed these shootings, it found that more than two-thirds were committed by shooters younger than 18. The analysis found that the median age for school shooters was 16. So, using this criteria, Murphy is correct, even slightly understating the case. For overall mass shootings — not just school shootings — academic studies have found that about a quarter of shooters were younger than 25. A large-scale RAND study found that 26% of mass public shooters between 1976 and 2018 were younger than 25. Another study from the University of Alabama found that 27.2% were younger than 25, and that 6.8% were younger than 18. A final point: Murphy referred to ""killers,"" but the Post analysis he relied on included both incidents that resulted in deaths and those that did not. Murphy said after the shooting in Uvalde that ""most of these killers tend to be 18, 19 years old."" That’s largely accurate when looking at school shootings alone, according to a Washington Post database of school shootings since 1999. The database did include shootings that did not result in a death, and the share of teenagers committing mass shootings overall is smaller",Mostly True,"May 25, 2022"

"In a recent year, the Milwaukee Police Department ""collected more guns per capita off the streets than in New York.”","Gun violence has racked the city of Milwaukee for decades, and May saw a weekend with a new set of shocking headlines, as 21 people were injured in three late-night shootings near Milwaukee's crowded Deer District after a Bucks playoff game. Tackling gun violence was among the issues at the top of Cavalier Johnson's priority list in his successful bid to win the Milwaukee mayor’s office. Days after his historic win, Johnson had this to say April 9, 2022, on PBS Wisconsin’s ""Here & Now"" show, telling anchor Frederica Freyberg:  ""Unfortunately, at the local level, we don’t control gun law. We just react to it. In one of the more recent years in Milwaukee, our police department collected more guns per capita off the streets than in New York."" That caught our attention, given the vast difference in size — and reputations — between the two cities.  Is Johnson right? Let’s start with gun recoveries by the Milwaukee Police Department, a number that has been on the rise in recent years. 2015: 2,504 guns recovered 2016: 2,421 2017: 2,753 2018: 2,908 2019: 2,621 2020: 3,097 2021: 3,279 As of April 20, 2022, the police department had recovered 927 guns — compared with the 681 reported at about the same time the year before. To be sure, a per-capita approach is the best way to compare Milwaukee and New York City, which is approximately 10 times larger. In this case, though, Johnson was pretty vague in declaring the city led in ""one of the more recent years."" Which year? When asked for backup, Johnson’s staff pointed to 2016 and provided two articles — one published by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, the other by Wiscontext, which is part of PBS Wisconsin. Both articles reported that Milwaukee had a higher gun recovery per capita versus some of the country’s largest metropolitan cities. In 2016, the 2,421 guns recovered by Milwaukee police translated into a rate of 406.84 guns per 100,000 people, according to the Journal Sentinel article.  That same year, New York City reported 3,583 gun recoveries, which translated into about 42 per 100,000 people, according to a 2017 report issued by the city of Chicago. The numbers do not include any guns obtained through turn-in or buyback programs. The city of Chicago report was comparing its experience with that of other large cities, and was largely aimed at determining where guns used in crimes come from.  In any case, that means the rate in Milwaukee, in that year, was 10 times that of New York. Milwaukee even surpassed two other major U.S. cities featured in the report: Chicago and Los Angeles.  In 2016, Chicago counted 6,644 gun recoveries, with a rate of 244 per 100,000 people, while Los Angeles had 5,908 gun recoveries in the same year, with 149 per 100,000. Many factors go into gun recoveries, including more aggressive policing, special patrols and initiatives and the like. But Johnson made a narrow, focused claim, and on it hit the mark. Indeed, as the Journal Sentinel article noted, Milwaukee police routinely recover guns at a higher rate than many other major cities — so, truly, Johnson probably would have been safe even if he had  been more expansive in making his point. Johnson claimed that in a recent year, the Milwaukee Police Department ""collected more guns per capita off the streets than in New York."" Although the time frame Johnson referred to was vague, the claim was on point, as Milwaukee’s gun recoveries per capita numbers in 2016 were more than 10 times higher than what New York City reported for that year",True,"May 24, 2022"
"The mass shooting in Buffalo, New York was a “false flag event.”","Ten people were shot to death by a man who police say went to a Buffalo, New York, grocery store on May 14 with the expressed purpose of killing Black people. The shooter was arrested and officials say they are investigating the incident as a racially motivated hate crime. But some social media and internet claims are falsely suggesting the whole thing is a non-story — fabricated, even.  ""Absolutely NOTHING about the ‘mass shooting’ in Buffalo, NY adds up to anything but a total false flag event,"" one person tweeted. ""I'm calling b*******."" ""Alex Jones Predicted The White Supremacist False Flag Shooting At The Grocery Store,"" read a headline on InfoWars, the website run by Jones, who has long baselessly claimed mass shootings such as the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary were fabricated. The claims cite as evidence everything from quick media response to the age of a photo included in a document the shooter was reported to have written explaining his motive. No matter what supposed evidence these posts cite, the claim, like the evidence, is wrong. ""False flag"" historically referred to military events in which forces would fly the flag of another country to deceive their enemies, or when governments staged an attack on themselves and then blamed an enemy for those violent actions. But in more recent history, actual false flag events are far outweighed by conspiracy theories that wrongly label real crises as staged — for example, the numerous theories that the 9/11 attacks weren’t real, or Jones’ repeated claim about Sandy Hook. That is the case here. In the case of the Buffalo incident, there’s plenty of evidence showing that it happened. On the afternoon of May 14, a gunman opened fire in the parking lot of Tops Friendly Grocery Store in Buffalo. He shot four people, three of whom he killed, then went inside the grocery store and shot eight more people.  In total, 13 people were shot, 10 of whom lost their lives.  Shonell Harris, a manager at Tops, told The Buffalo News that she was stocking groceries when she heard the shots.  ""I heard a noise. Then it got louder, and closer. And everybody started running towards the back,"" said Harris. She then described that once she was outside, she ran around to the front of the building, where she saw someone get shot. She then began looking for her daughter, who also worked at the store and survived the shooting. The names and photos of most of the victims have since been released. They include Katherine Massey, a 72-year-old who had written several letters about gun control reform; Aaron Salter Jr., a 55-year-old former police officer who worked as a security guard at Tops and tried to shoot at the gunman; and Roberta Drury, a 32-year-old who was helping her brother through his leukemia treatment and worked in her family's restaurant. The family of Buffalo shooting victim Ruth Whitfield, the 86-year-old mother of former Buffalo Fire Commissioner Garnell Whitfield Jr., mourns her loss during a press conference on May 16, 2022. On the day of the shooting, Ruth Whitfield had stopped at Tops Friendly Market after visiting her husband, who lives in a nursing home. (AP)  The shooter, who police have identified as 18-year-old Payton Gendron, live-streamed the event on Twitch. The social media company said in a statement that it took down the video within two minutes after the violence started. Before surrendering, Gendron initially turned the gun onto himself before being talked down by police.  Eleven who were pierced by bullets were Black. According to the online Google document linked to Gendront, he believed in the ""great replacement theory,"" which holds that immigrants and other people of color are being brought into the country to ""replace"" white voters.  The FBI is investigating the incident, with FBI Director Christopher Wray characterizing it during a May 16 conference call as ""a targeted attack, a hate crime, and an act of racially motivated violent extremism."" Attorney General Merrick Garland said the Justice Department would investigate the matter as a hate crime and an act of racially-motivated violent extremism and vowed that they were committed to conducting a ""thorough and expeditious investigation into this shooting and to seeking justice for these innocent victims."" And politicians from both sides of the U.S. political divide responded to the event with statements acknowledging the tragedy. President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden on May 17 met with family members of the victims, calling it ""a murderous, racist rampage."" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky, called the shooter’s actions ""abhorrent.""
  Social media posts have claimed that the Buffalo mass shooting on May 14 was a false flag event.  Witness testimonies, the names and images of the victims, continuous news reports and immediate investigations of the attack from the local and federal governments prove that this was in no way staged. The shooter’s own accounts of the event give another grave angle to this tragedy and both Republican and Democratic political leaders have issued statements responding to the tragedy.

"Matt Dolan sponsored Michael Bloomberg's “red-flag gun confiscation law, letting the people reporting your social media posts send SWAT teams to your house to take your guns.""","Did a Republican U.S. Senate candidate sponsor legislation to allow citizens to send SWAT teams to confiscate guns from gun owners? That’s the attack made by a gun-rights group against Matt Dolan, an Ohio state senator who’s seeking the GOP nomination for U.S. Senate in Ohio’s May 3 primary. In a minute-long video ad, Ohio Gun Owners said that another candidate for the Republican nomination, former Ohio state treasurer Josh Mandel, would expand gun rights.  Then the ad alluded to 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg, a gun control advocate. It claimed that Dolan ""sponsored Bloomberg's red-flag gun confiscation law, letting the people reporting your social media posts send SWAT teams to your house to take your guns."" This description of the bill distorts how a policy Dolan sponsored would have worked. Red-flag laws, which have been adopted in some states, provide a mechanism for a court to order that guns be taken from people who exhibit dangerous behavior before they harm themselves or others.  An Ohio bill that Dolan sponsored, which did not become law,  would have required a court to order gun confiscations. But it would have applied to people being evaluated for involuntary hospitalization, not to people in the community at large.  It would not have allowed for citizens to direct SWAT team confiscations based merely on a person’s social media posts. Under red-flag laws — also known as extreme risk protection order laws — police or citizens can petition a court for an order removing guns from a person who is in the community. Nineteen states and the District of Columbia have adopted such laws, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. That includes 14 laws that came after the 2018 mass school shooting in Parkland, Florida, according to Stateline, a project of the Pew Charitable Trusts. In December 2019, Bloomberg, a former New York mayor, proposed a number of gun-control measures, including a federal red-flag law, as part of his presidential campaign platform. In October 2019, Dolan introduced a gun bill known as ""STRONG Ohio"" in the wake of a mass shooting in Dayton. It was known as Republican Gov. Mike DeWine’s bill.  It did not receive a vote and did not become law. DeWine initially had indicated that his gun bill would include a red-flag provision, but one was not included, disappointing gun-control advocates. At the time, DeWine’s administration said it opted not to include a red-flag provision because one that protected gun owners’ due process proved ""inadequate and unworkable.""  Instead, DeWine proposed expanding the state's ""pink slip"" system, which places mentally ill Ohioans in hospitals for up to 72 hours, to include people dealing with chronic alcoholism or drug dependency.  After a hearing, a court could decide to take away that person’s guns.  Writing about the bill at the time, Dolan suggested that this provision was essentially the same as a red-flag law, but it was taking a ""constitutional route to achieve the same goals."" Dolan wrote: ""SB 221 builds upon current Ohio law, which allows a person to report an individual to authorities for an involuntary exam assessing threatening behavior, mental illness and/or addiction. The results of the medical exam are then utilized to, first, determine if medical intervention is needed to treat the individual, and, second, if the individual is mentally unfit to have access to firearms during this treatment. ... ""If, after a full due-process hearing, a court finds the individual should be prohibited from having a gun, law enforcement or family members can, under court order, safely remove the firearms from the individual."" Ohio Gun Owners responded to PolitiFact’s request for evidence behind its claim by alluding to the pink slip system. But the group did not provide any other supporting information. We didn’t receive a reply from Dolan’s campaign. In states with red-flag laws, guns can be taken temporarily from a person who is reported to police as being dangerous until a court hearing is held on whether the guns should be removed for a longer period. The Ohio law applies only when a person is being considered for forced hospitalization for, for example, mental illness. There is no factual basis to idea that, under the Ohio bill, a gun owner’s guns could have been taken away — by SWAT teams or by any other law enforcement means — simply due to a person reporting the gun owner’s social media posts to authorities. Court orders must be issued. Even with the more expansive red-flag laws, a judge or other judicial official such as a court commissioner hears a request from police or a citizen and decides whether to issue a preliminary order without holding a hearing or notifying the gun owner on whether the gun owner’s guns should be seized. These orders are temporary and last a couple of days to a few weeks, depending on the state. The gun owner then has a chance to make his or her case at a hearing before a judge decides on a final order. That order commonly lasts for a year. Ohio race could help decide Senate control The Ohio Senate seat is opening because Republican Rob Portman, who was elected in 2010, is not seeking reelection.  Besides Dolan and Mandel, the Republican candidates include businessman Mike Gibbons, former Ohio Republican Party chair Jane Timken and author and venture capitalist J.D. Vance.  The leading Democratic candidates are U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan and consumer protection attorney Morgan Harper. Overall, the race is rated by campaign watchers as ""leans"" Republican, ""likely"" Republican and ""solid"" Republican. Ohio Gun Owners claimed that Dolan ""sponsored Bloomberg's red-flag gun confiscation law, letting the people reporting your social media posts send SWAT teams to your house to take your guns."" Dolan sponsored a bill in Ohio, which did not become law, that would have allowed for guns to be taken from a person if a court determined, in certain situations, that person was a danger to himself or others. The bill would not have allowed for confiscations by SWAT teams based on citizens reporting a person’s social media posts",False,"May 2, 2022"
"Mehmet Oz ""called for a New Zealand-style gun ban"" and said ""Americans should have less access to guns.""","In his run for U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania, Dr. Mehmet Oz is branding himself as a protector of rights for gun owners.  So it might be surprising to GOP voters to see claims from his  chief rival for the Republican nomination that say he’s made numerous statements in support of gun-control measures. Former hedge fund CEO Dave McCormick used a  15-second video ad on Facebook and Instagram to describe Oz, the physician and TV personality who is endorsed by former President Donald Trump.  ""Mehmet Oz is anti-gun,"" the ad claims in text that appears over a grainy black-and-white image of Oz while dramatic music plays and other claims flash across the screen. ""Oz called for a New Zealand-style gun ban,"" says one. ""Oz: Americans should have ‘less access to guns.’""  Did Oz really say those things? A review of statements he has made on television, in social media posts and in bylined columns show Oz for years promoted these and other ideas supported by advocates of gun control measures. His position on these matters appears to have changed since he announced his plan to run for public office. The ""Second Amendment"" section of Oz’s campaign website says:  ""As a proud gun-owner, Dr. Oz is a firm believer in the Second Amendment and our constitutional right to bear arms for protection. He opposes anti-gun measures like red flag laws and liberal gun grabs … every law-abiding American citizen should be allowed to buy the gun of their desire."" But in nationally circulated newspaper columns that Oz co-wrote with Dr. Michael Roizen — and that Oz has recently distanced himself from — Oz frequently endorsed gun control stances. Oz’s campaign did not reply to our requests for information.  In 2019, Oz indicated support for a gun ban like one in New Zealand. That year, New Zealand banned most semiautomatic weapons following a terror attack on two mosques that left 51 people dead.  Oz was the lead author of a question-and-answer syndicated newspaper column that he wrote with Roizen. In a 2019 column that called gun deaths in America a public health crisis, the doctors suggested the United States reinstitute a ban on assault rifles.  The column ended by saying the New Zealand parliament passed legislation banning most semi-automatic and military-style weapons with a hope ""to get as many of these assault weapons off their streets ASAP. Can we?"" Oz once said Americans should have less access to guns — but he did not state support for any specific gun control measure. In a 2013 column about America’s overall health ranking, Oz and his colleague cited a number of health problems and noted the number of gun-related homicides in the U.S. They offered dietary tips and other health suggestions. ""And let's add in more access to health care; less access to guns that aren't designed for hunting; more access to good nutrition"" and other steps, they wrote. They did not elaborate on how to achieve ""less access"" to guns. McCormick’s campaign cited to us additional Oz statements on gun control that are not noted in the ad. Background checks: In a 2014 column, Oz and his colleague  wrote that ""until the government embraces gun-safety measures — polls show that 79% of the population favors universal background checks for gun buyers — it's every doctor's responsibility to their patients and your responsibility to yourself and your family to reduce gun violence."" Waiting periods: In a 2017 column, the doctors wrote: ""One regulation that seems to be very effective in reducing gun violence, and shouldn’t bother anyone, is to institute waiting periods in every state. … Just think how many lives strict background checks and tighter automatic weapon, magazine and ammunition regulations could save without impinging on anyone’s rights."" Stricter regulation: Oz and his colleague expressed support in a 2018 column for ""responsible gun laws"" to reduce gun deaths among children. They said there are twice as many pediatric firearm deaths in states with the ""most lenient"" gun regulations than in states with the strictest regulations. The column also urged readers who support stricter regulations to write to their representatives.   Study gun violence: Also in 2018, Oz tweeted in reference to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: ""Right now, the @CDCgov is NOT funded to study gun violence in this country. It’s time we treat shootings as a public health problem. Contact your congressperson today to demand they fund the #CDC to comprehensively study gun violence. #EndTheBan."" Red-flag laws: On his TV show in 2019, Oz said red flag laws, which provide a mechanism to take guns from people exhibiting dangerous behavior before they harm themselves or others, ""may help protect you and your family."" At a campaign stop in February 2022, Oz said he believes in some red flag-style laws to evaluate whether people with certain mental health issues should be allowed to be armed, but that he is against any national red-flag registry, according to a local news report of the event.  On March 18, 2022, in a story about the columns supporting gun-control measures, Fox News reported that Oz disavowed the columns. In an interview, Roizen told PolitiFact that for most of the more than 15 years that he and Oz co-authored the column, he and Oz typically wrote the columns separately, without consulting one another. Roizen said he believes he wrote all of the columns that supported gun-control measures.  ""I believe he believed in people having guns, the Second Amendment,"" Roizen said, but that he didn’t know Oz’s opinions on any gun-control measures. He said Oz never expressed any objections to him about the columns that supported gun control. ""I don’t remember any conversation about it at all,"" Roizen said. The Pennsylvania race is for the seat held by Republican Pat Toomey, who was first elected in 2010 and decided not to seek re-election.  Besides McCormick and Oz, the major Republican candidates are commentator Kathy Barnette, real estate developer Jeff Bartos, Philadelphia attorney George Bochetto and Carla Sands, who served as Trump's ambassador to Denmark.  The Real Clear Politics polling average as of April 12 shows McCormick in the lead by 2.6 percentage points over Oz. An Emerson College Polling/The Hill poll of very likely Republican Pennsylvania voters conducted April 3-4 showed McCormick in the lead, by 18% to 17%, over Oz. Trump endorsed Oz on April 9, five days after McCormick’s ad started running. Trump said Oz ""will always fight for and support our under-siege Second Amendment."" The leading Democratic candidates are Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta and U.S. Rep.  Conor Lamb. The primaries are May 17. Overall, the Nov. 8 general election race is rated as a toss-up and as ""tilts Republican."" The outcome could help determine which party controls the Senate, now split 50-50. McCormick said in an ad that Oz ""called for a New Zealand-style gun ban"" and said ""Americans should have less access to guns."" Oz currently is running as a pro-gun candidate, but that is in contrast with statements he made for years in support of gun-control measures such as an assault rifle ban and measures to restrict gun purchases, such as background checks and waiting periods.  Oz’s statement about less access to guns was vague; it did not call for governmental restrictions on gun access",Mostly True,"April 15, 2022"
The Brooklyn subway attack was a false flag.,"Hours after a gunman opened fire on a crowded subway train during morning rush hour in Brooklyn, New York, some people logged onto social media to falsely claim that the attack was staged, or what many call a ""false flag"" operation.  ""Biden gives a gun grabbing speech yesterday, when NO ONE was talking about guns, and voila! FALSE FLAG,"" someone tweeted, sharing a story about the shooting. ""The guy fired 33 rounds in a crowded subway car and hit 10 people. No deaths, and the cameras just HAPPENED to not be functioning, and the guy ‘got away’. This has EVERY marking of a False Flag,"" another said.  Other reasons social media users used to claim that the attack was fake include bogus claims of crisis actors and ""fake blood."" ""False flags"" are supposed covert operations designed to deflect blame and are frequently the subject of conspiracy theories. Posts making these claims were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) On April 12, a man popped open a smoke canister in a subway car and started shooting, firing over 30 rounds and striking 10 people as the train pulled into the 36th Street station in Sunset Park. Five riders were critically wounded in the rush-hour attack, and many more were injured in the chaos that followed, police said. No deaths have been reported. Wearing a gas mask and construction vest, the man — identified by law enforcement as 62-year-old Frank R. James — fled the scene, leaving behind a gun, ammo, gasoline and fireworks. He was arrested a day later in Manhattan. While a motive has not yet been established, investigators said that James will face federal terrorism charges. There is no evidence that the attack was staged.  Multiple local and national news organizations have been closely covering the shooting in Brooklyn, obtaining live footage, speaking to law enforcement and interviewing witnesses. Claims about ""fake blood"" and ""crisis actors"" are baseless and appear to solely come from unsourced social media posts.  Cameras not working in the New York City subway system isn’t evidence of a conspiracy — it reflects long-standing issues plaguing the Metropolitan Transportation Authority that include frequent breakdowns and mechanical failures. The day before the shooting, President Joe Biden did announce new measures to crack down on so-called ""ghost guns,"" firearms that come in parts that can be bought online and assembled without much of a trace.  But the new rule, which essentially expands the definition of a firearm to cover these kits, is unrelated to the shooting. The firearm used in the attack wasn’t a ghost gun. Police said James purchased it from a federal firearms licensee in Ohio in 2012. While James had multiple arrests dating back to the 1990s, he has no felony convictions, law enforcement said, allowing him to make the purchase. New York law enforcement also debunked reports that said the FBI had previously investigated James and cleared him (a narrative many use to support false flag theories) saying in an April 13 news conference following James’ arrest that there is ""no record"" of any FBI investigation involving James and that claims stating otherwise are inaccurate.  It’s become common after a mass shooting to hear false claims that they were staged. This happens, partly, because these false beliefs often affirm people’s worldviews, researchers have told PolitiFact. When something tragic happens that seems to challenge one’s belief systems, it can be more comfortable to think that event was all staged for nefarious purposes. Distrust in the media and police also help push these hoaxes along and makes people more susceptible to believe in elaborate set-ups. ""It can be a lot more emotionally comfortable to believe that not only did it not happen, but that the thing that happened is actually a conspiracy to delegitimize your beliefs,"" said Mike Caulfield, a research scientist at the Center for an Informed Public at the University of Washington. One way people can confront false flag claims during chaotic events is to first ask themselves if they or the people posting these conspiracy theories are experts in crises, Caulfield said, and instead of jumping to conclusions, seek out experts and credible sources first. Social media posts claim that the mass shooting in the New York City subway was a false flag. This is baseless and relies on unsourced social media posts.

"“You couldn’t buy a cannon when, in fact, the Second Amendment passed.""","President Joe Biden announced new regulations to curb the proliferation of so-called ""ghost guns,"" unserialized firearms made from kits. Biden spoke of codifying a prohibition on manufacturing these firearms without serial numbers, requiring sellers to conduct a background check on prospective buyers, among other rules. He also detailed his desire to see assault weapons and high-capacity magazines banned. Then the president invoked history to support his stance.  ""From the very beginning, the Second Amendment didn’t say you can own any gun you want, big as you want,"" Biden said at the press conference. ""You couldn’t buy a cannon when, in fact, the Second Amendment passed."" This isn’t the first time Biden made such an assertion about the Second Amendment. Or even the second.

"""48-Hour waiting periods limit crimes of passion and keep our communities safe.”","On Feb. 2, 2016, Caroline Nosal, 24, of Stoughton, was shot to death by a 26-year-old former co-worker outside the grocery store where she worked – and from where the assailant was suspended, then fired for harassing Nosal.  Exactly six years later, her father, James Nosal, spoke at a Madison news conference where a pair of Democratic lawmakers announced a bill that would reinstate a 48-hour waiting period on handgun purchases in Wisconsin. In 2015, then-Gov. Scott Walker signed a bill repealing the nearly 40-year-old provision, arguing that it was outdated because background checks could now be performed so much faster than before. In pushing for a renewed 48-hour period at the news conference, James Nosal asked of the man who killed his daughter: ""If he had had to wait 48 hours, would he have rethought his plan?""  State Rep. Shelia Stubbs, D-Madison, is sponsoring the bill — which is a longshot in the Republican-controlled Legislature – with state Sen. Melissa Agard, D-Madison. According to an analysis of current law by the Legislative Reference Bureau, before a federally licensed firearms dealer may transfer a handgun after a sale, the dealer must have the Department of Justice perform a background check to determine if the purchaser is prohibited from possessing a firearm under federal or state law. Under the proposal — AB1059 in the Assembly and SB1003,1,2 in the Senate — the dealer would be prohibited from transferring the handgun until 48 hours after the background check was requested.  In a Feb. 2 tweet, Stubbs described the need this way: ""48-Hour waiting periods limit crimes of passion and keep our communities safe. Every weapon has the ability to permanently impact individuals, families, and entire communities. Without a waiting period, we allow impulsive decisions to result in terrible consequences.""  We’re interested in the first sentence: Do such waiting periods ""limit crimes of passion and keep our communities safe""? And, if so, what research supports it? When asked for backup, Stubbs cited a 2017 study published by researchers from the Harvard Business School that examined the impact of waiting periods in the United States from 1970 to 2014.  According to the study, waiting periods reduced firearm homicides by 17% and states with waiting periods avoided around 750 homicides per year. Stubbs also cited a 2018 Behavioral Scientist article, ""The Case for Handgun Waiting Periods,"" by the same researchers who noted that ""research from behavioral economics and psychology has found that intense emotions like anger and sadness — ‘visceral factors,’ in academic language — can cause people to take actions they later regret, such as resorting to gun violence."" The researcher went on to say that those intense emotions are often transitory. ""Given sufficient time to cool off, the types of intense negative emotions that lead to violent tendencies can pass,"" the researchers wrote. ""This suggests that inserting even a short delay in the gun-buying process has the potential to reduce gun violence, without restricting anyone’s right to own a gun.""  Finally, she cited a Wisconsin-focused study, published Feb. 21, 2021, that examined suicide rates in the wake of the repeal of the waiting period in Wisconsin. Using state mortality data, the researchers concluded that the repeal ""correlated with the increase of firearm-related suicides among Wisconsin residents of color and Wisconsinites residing in urban counties.""  John Gross, a clinical associate professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Law, told us it can be hard to determine how a particular policy change, such as waiting periods, impacts crime rates or public safety.  ""When it comes to waiting periods, older studies have shown mixed results,"" he said in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin. ""Some have shown a small decrease in gun violence while others found no correlation between waiting periods and gun violence."" Thomas Leager, executive director of Waupaca-based Wisconsin Gun Owners Inc., argued that a waiting period does not by itself stop a crime, particularly if a gun is bought ""off the black market.""  (Indeed, in Wisconsin, and many other states, background checks are not required for purchase of any guns from sellers who are not federally licensed dealers. This is the ""loophole"" that gun-control activists often cite — sales between friends, online or unlicensed dealers at gun shows). Leager also noted that a waiting period could prevent people from getting a gun in time to protect themselves: ""A waiting period for a woman who is being stalked or harassed could literally be deadly.""  Setting the rhetoric aside, when it comes to the ""keeping communities safe"" aspect of the claim, there are studies that support Stubbs’ claim, but there are many situations where a gun could still be obtained without any such wait. So, that information is missing. Stubbs’ claim is more problematic when it comes to her assertion that waiting periods would reduce ""crimes of passion."" On the surface, it would seem obvious: If you don’t have a gun at the time, you can’t shoot someone in that moment. But the very definition, a ""crime of passion"" involves an illegal action committed in the heat of the moment in response to provocation (as opposed to an illegal act that was premeditated or deliberate). So if a gun were involved in such an incident, the perpetrator would already have it. Gross, the University of Wisconsin-Madison professor, noted that recent studies have found a correlation between waiting periods and a reduction in suicides.  ""The most common form of gun violence is actually suicide,"" he wrote. ""So, if Rep. Stubbs is including suicide as a ‘crime of passion,’ which the correlation between delaying the purchase of a gun and decreased suicide rates suggests it is, then the statement is true."" At the same time, Gross noted that many believe suicide should not be considered a crime, so designating it as a ""crime of passion"" could be misleading.  Finally, he said, there is plenty of evidence that the presence of a gun in a home significantly increases the chances that one partner will commit homicide.  ""For example, one study showed that direct access to guns during a domestic violence incident increases the likelihood of a female victim’s homicide compared to other acts of violence by 11 times,"" Gross said. ""What we don’t know is whether a waiting period significantly impacts the rate of gun ownership over the long term, which would then reduce the number of homes where there was a gun and, consequently, would reduce the rate of intimate partner violence or ‘crimes of passion.’ "" Stubbs claimed ""48-Hour waiting periods limit crimes of passion and keep our communities safe."" Some studies have shown reductions in homicides in states with a waiting period, but many guns are obtained illegally or through sellers where background checks are not required. Meanwhile, ""crimes of passion,"" by their very definition, happen in the moment, so if a gun were involved in such cases, the perpetrator would already have it. That said, studies show a waiting period can reduce suicides. So, there is some evidence for both parts of the claim, as well as factors that muddy the water",Half True,"February 18, 2022"
“Joe Biden uses the ATF to illegally track your gun transactions.”,"The Ohio U.S. Senate race is wide open, with both Republicans and Democrats vying for the seat currently held by retiring Republican Rob Portman. In a Facebook ad, GOP candidate J.D. Vance took aim at Rep. Tim Ryan, a contender on the Democratic side. ""Tim Ryan pretends to care about the working class, but he's a fraud who does nothing while his friend Joe Biden uses the ATF to illegally track your gun transactions and trample on your 2nd Amendment rights,"" Vance’s ad said Feb. 7. ""Unlike Tim Ryan, I'll fight to end Biden's illegal gun database."" The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is a frequent target of gun rights supporters. ATF operates under a number of legal restrictions, and here, we look into whether it has violated those limits, as Vance claims. The core complaint is that ATF has millions of records, and gun rights advocates view those records as an invitation to abuse. But the Vance campaign was unable to point to a specific act by the agency that broke the law, and we couldn’t find one either.  The Vance ad links to an interview Vance had with Fox News’ Tucker Carlson. During the brief Feb. 4 segment, Vance talked about an ATF ""database"" that ""is ultimately a back door to a gun registry in this country.""  ""Once you allow gun registry, you effectively allow the disarming of your citizenry,"" Vance said. A gun registry would be a comprehensive database of every gun owner in America, showing who they were, where they lived and what weapons they owned. Lawmakers have passed laws aimed at preventing the ATF from spending a dime on creating such a database. As recently as 2011, Congress barred the ATF from ""consolidating or centralizing"" records.  Fox News did not say the ATF actually had a gun registry. As Vance mentioned an ATF database, the chyron changed to say ""Biden admin appears to be creating unlawful federal gun database."" Appearing to do something is not the same as doing it.  There’s no particular tie between Biden and gun records. Most of the gun records Vance is talking about predate Biden’s administration by decades, although Biden has drawn the ire of gun rights supporters for proposing that firearm dealers retain their records forever, rather than disposing of them after 20 years. (Screenshot) We asked the Vance campaign what ATF action had been found illegal. The campaign press office gave no example, and cast the ad’s claim of illegal ATF activity as an opinion, rather than an assertion of fact. ""Anytime a government agency infringes on the Second Amendment, any reasonable constitutionalist will deem that illegal,"" the campaign said in a statement. The statement did not clarify how ATF has infringed on the Second Amendment. In his interview, Vance voiced concern about the ATF collecting records. The argument is that it would be a short hop from simply holding the records to converting them into a comprehensive database. What’s missing is evidence that any such hop has been made. ATF has long been caught in the tension between the need to keep records to catch criminals and concerns about how those records could be used. Over the years, both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have passed laws aimed at allowing the agency to help law enforcement when a weapon is used in a crime. That requires a lot of record keeping. Congress has paired those laws with others that set detailed limits that often make those records difficult to use. The records of firearm dealers who go out of business is a perfect example. The ATF manages several large collections of forms that track when firearms change hands. This includes when a manufacturer sells weapons to a licensed gun store, when federally licensed firearm dealers sell to other dealers, and when they sell to a retail customer. In a country that has more privately owned guns than people, these exchanges happen often. One particular collection has amassed more than 920 million records over the past five decades. About 867 million are images of the records, and the rest are hard copies waiting to be converted to images. These come from licensed dealers that have gone out of business. Under a 1968 law, they must send their sales records to the ATF. The records contain the make and serial number of the weapon and the company or person who bought it. The Out of Business Records are a critical tool for investigating gun crimes. When law enforcement officers recover a gun connected to a crime, they turn to the FBI and ATF to trace who owns it. The first step is to call the gunmaker, which leads to a wholesaler, which leads to a retailer, and so on. About 40% of the time, this process leads to a company that is no longer in business. That’s when the Out of Business Records come into play. It’s this bank of records that Vance and some other gun-rights advocates warn will become the seed of an illegal national database of gun owners. But the Out of Business Records system isn’t set up to work that way. It simply doesn’t fit the modern definition of a database. By law, these forms are stored as digital images that cannot be searched by a computer. There is no way for someone to enter a serial number and have the system spit out the details from the files. It doesn’t have computer readable data fields, it can’t be sorted by field, and it can’t be queried by field. Instead, each search is done by a staffer going through images one by one. The ATF sent us a picture of how a digital image file appears on a screen in their record tracing center. Out of Business Record search screen (ATF) ""Imagine looking at pictures on your phone,"" April Langwell, chief of public affairs at ATF said. ""Our people sit there and literally flip through thousands and thousands of images."" That said, staff typically find a matching record in about 20 minutes, although with about 1,700 requests coming in each day, it can take a day before the search begins. Langwell also noted that the 920 million figure doesn’t represent the number of firearms that were transferred by these dealers. Each transaction could produce three, six or even more images. Some of the recorded transactions involved more than one weapon. A majority of the transactions, Langwell said, don’t involve a person buying for their own use; they were transfers between dealers, or between a gunmaker and a wholesaler. Vance tied this digital image system to Democrats, but it has Republican roots. It was funded as part of an omnibus spending bill in 2004 when Republicans controlled both the House and the Senate, and George W. Bush was president. Until then, old records were stored on microfiche.  The lawmakers’ agreement on the bill said that members of both parties agreed on ""the need for the ATF to begin converting tens of thousands of existing records of out-of-business federal firearms dealers from film to digital images.""  And it doesn’t run afoul of any law. The Government Accountability Office examined ATF legal compliance in 2016. While it found some issues with other firearms tracking systems, for the Out of Business Records, the GAO found full compliance. And for the issues it did find, it said ATF changed its practices to meet legal requirements. In one case, the ATF had decided on its own in 2009 that one program went too far and canceled it. In another instance, in response to the GAO inquiry, the ATF deleted files that went beyond its legal authorization. Adam Winkler, who specializes in constitutional law and gun policy at the UCLA School of Law, told us he sees no truth in the claim that the ATF has broken the law. Vance said, ""Biden uses the ATF to illegally track your gun transactions.""  His campaign did not identify any actual legal infraction to back the claim. Some gun rights advocates warn that the vast collection of transaction records at the ATF could lay the groundwork for a national gun registry, which would be illegal. But Biden is not involved in any such effort. By law, the ATF’s largest collection of records can’t be searched by a computer. A 2016 GAO review found that the agency followed the law for these records, and had corrected its practices for other data systems it ran",False,"February 10, 2022"
Kyle Rittenhouse was an “armed person” crossing state lines when he came to Kenosha protests in 2020.,"When Kyle Rittenhouse was acquitted of killing two men and wounding another in a series of shootings during a night of unrest in Kenosha in 2020, the verdict drew cheers and outrage. And bad information -- just as the case has from the very start. In condemning the Nov. 19, 2021 verdict, some pointed to the fact Rittenhouse, now 18, had come to Wisconsin that day, joining a group of other armed individuals who said they were there to protect property. In a post-verdict tweet, U.S. Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-New York, called the outcome ""heartbreaking.""  ""Justice cannot tolerate armed persons crossing state lines looking for trouble while people engage in First Amendment-protected protest,"" he wrote. Part of that statement -- the claim Rittenhouse was armed when he crossed state lines -- was repeated by many in the wake of the verdict. But that information is wrong. When asked for backup, Nadler spokesperson Dan Rubin said the tweet was trying to make the point that Rittenhouse could be open to further review by the U.S. Department of Justice because he crossed state lines to be in Wisconsin for the protests.  The tweet, Rubin said, wasn’t meant to convey that Rittenhouse had taken the gun itself over state lines, arguing that the situation ""at least opens up the possibility of a broader review from DOJ."" But that’s not what the tweet says. It suggests Rittenhouse brought the gun to Wisconsin, when testimony said he did not. (To be sure, there was plenty of controversy around the fact he had a gun, and Rittenhouse initially faced a misdemeanor charge of unlawfully possessing the gun as a minor. Under Wisconsin law, anyone under 18 who possesses a dangerous weapon is guilty of a misdemeanor, unless they fall under an exception, such as for hunting. For months, Rittenhouse's attorneys pointed to one of those exceptions that they argued allows 16- and 17-year-olds to carry rifles and shotguns as long as they are not unlawfully short-barreled. Prosecutors acknowledged the gun was not short-barreled, after which the judge tossed the charge.) During the trial, Dominick Black, a close friend, testified that he agreed to purchase the gun for Rittenhouse, according to a Nov. 2, 2021 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel report.  Black used money Rittenhouse gave him to make the purchase in Wisconsin, knowing the purchase was illegal. Rittenhouse and Black agreed that Rittenhouse wouldn’t get the gun himself until he turned 18.  Rittenhouse did shoot the weapon several times the weekend it was purchased while up north at Black’s family hunting property in May 2020, the Journal Sentinel report said.  Black testified that normally, the AR-15 was stored in Black’s home in Kenosha, locked up in a gun safe. The safe could only be opened by Black’s stepfather. But the night of the unrest, the guns were taken out of the safe and into the basement.  Some time after Rittenhouse arrived in Kenosha on Aug. 25, 2020, he retrieved the gun from Black’s basement and went into the downtown area.  (A final note: Now that Rittenhouse has been acquitted, Black is asking that charges against him related to buying the gun be thrown out. A decision on that has been delayed.) Like many others, Nadler said in a tweet following Rittenhouse’s acquittal that the teen had traveled across state lines with a firearm.  But Rittenhouse never had his gun in Illinois, according to testimony in the trial.

But Gov. Tony Evers called in the National Guard on Aug. 24, and the guardsmen arrived the same day. The Rittenhouse shooting happened the following day, Aug. 25.  The events that unfolded in Kenosha that summer began on Aug. 23, when Jacob Blake was shot in the back by a police officer who was trying to arrest him on an outstanding warrant. Blake was left paralyzed. He had been armed with a knife during the encounter, and the officer was not charged with a crime.  A bystander’s video of the shooting circulated widely and reignited protests that had blanketed the U.S. earlier in the year, after police brutality against other Black people such as George Floyd. Protesters poured into Kenosha, the New York Times reported.  The day after the Blake shooting, protests grew violent, with more than 30 fires set and dozens of buildings destroyed. Evers activated the National Guard and 125 members arrived in Kenosha on the night of Aug. 24. On Aug. 25, Rittenhouse was invited by a friend to go to Kenosha to protect a car dealership during the protests. He has testified that he went to provide first aid. He was armed with an AR-15.  That evening, just before midnight, Rittenhouse shot three people, killing two and wounding the third. He is charged with intentional homicide, reckless homicide and other crimes, and he has pleaded self-defense.

(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Two important facts are left out:  Two of the people Rittenhouse shot were killed, leading to two homicide charges against him, including one that carries a mandatory life prison sentence.  No one died in the school shooting, and Simpkins faces much lesser charges of aggravated assault. The jail and bail details have been widely reported. Simpkins was released from the Tarrant County jail in Fort Worth on Oct. 7, 2021, the day after the school shooting, after paying a $75,000 bond. His case is pending, with a court date scheduled for Dec. 10, 2021. Rittenhouse was released from the Kenosha County jail on Nov. 20, 2020, on $2 million bail. He had been in custody since surrendering to police in his hometown of Antioch, Ill., on Aug. 26, 2020, the day after the Kenosha shooting. The jury in his trial on homicide charges began deliberations on Nov. 16, 2021. Simpkins is charged with three counts of felony aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. Simpkins, 18, was involved in a fight with a 15-year-old student at his high school in Arlington, which is between Dallas and Fort Worth, on Oct. 6, 2021, according to an arrest warrant and news reports. The incident left four people hurt, including three wounded by gunfire. During the fight, Simpkins fired shots from a handgun, according to police. He turned himself in later that day after police said he was wanted for the shooting. One teacher was injured from a fall. Three people were wounded, two seriously: the 15-year-old who was in the fight with Simpkins, who was released from a hospital after several surgeries about two weeks later, and a teacher who was hospitalized for about a week. News reports initially linked the shooting to Simpkins being bullied at school, but the police chief later said bullying was not a factor. Rittenhouse is charged with four felonies, including two homicide charges. Rittenhouse, then 17, traveled across state lines from his home in Antioch, Ill., about 20 miles to Kenosha, site of violent protests over a police shooting days earlier. He was armed with an AR-15, and on a self-described mission to protect property. During a confrontation, he shot three people, killing two. Charged with four felonies and one misdemeanor weapons charge, Rittenhouse said that he shot in self-defense.  If convicted of the most serious charge, first-degree intentional homicide in one of the shootings, Rittenhouse would face a mandatory sentence of life in prison. A viral image contrasting the treatment of two teens charged in shooting cases said that Simpkins, a Black teen shooter, got one day in jail and $75,000 bail, while Rittenhouse, a white shooter, got two months in jail and $2 million bail, implying that Simpkins was treated more favorably. The bail and jail details are correct. But the post leaves out important facts: No one died in the case involving the Black teen, Simpkins, who was charged with aggravated assault. But two people died in the case involving the white teen, Rittenhouse, who crossed state lines to commit the shooting and was charged with homicide.

Kyle Rittenhouse’s mother “drove him across state lines and dropped him off in the middle of a riot armed with an assault rifle” in Kenosha.,"With the trial of Kyle Rittenhouse nearing its end, a viral image on social media attacked the mother of the Illinois teen who is charged with shooting two men to death during a race-related violent protest in Kenosha, Wis. The image, with pictures of Rittenhouse and his mother, Wendy Rittenhouse, stated: ""Why are we just glazing over the fact that Kyle Rittenhouse’s mother put her minor child in a vehicle, drove him across state lines and dropped him off in the middle of a riot armed with an assault rifle? Why is she not behind bars?"" The image, shared in an Instagram post from actor D.L. Hughley, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We could find nothing to back the attack on Wendy Rittenhouse. There is no evidence that Wendy Rittenhouse, who has not been charged with a crime, drove her son to Kenosha, and no evidence that Kyle Rittenhouse was armed when he left their Illinois home.According to court documents and testimony, Kyle Rittenhouse arrived in Kenosha on his own and went to the protest with a friend who provided him with the gun. The gun was kept at the home of the friend’s stepfather in Kenosha.  Three nights of violent protests erupted in Kenosha, which is roughly halfway between Milwaukee and Chicago, after a white Kenosha police officer shot a Black man, Jacob Blake, while arresting him on Aug. 23, 2020. Kenosha is a city of about 100,000 residents, and almost 80% are white. Blake, who was armed with a knife, was left paralyzed; the officer was not charged with a crime. Two days after the shooting, Rittenhouse, then 17, traveled from his home in Antioch, Ill., about 20 miles from Kenosha, to the protests. He was armed with an AR-15, with a magazine that held 30 rounds of ammunition, and a self-described mission to protect property. During a confrontation, he shot three people, killing two. Charged with one count of intentional homicide and one count of reckless homicide, among other crimes, Rittenhouse’s trial centers on his claim that he shot in self-defense. Attorneys began their closing arguments to the jury on Nov. 15. Here is the first issue with the social media post attacking Wendy Rittenhouse: There is no evidence that Kyle Rittenhouse possessed any gun before he arrived in Kenosha from Illinois. The gun Rittenhouse used in the shootings was provided by his friend, 20-year-old Dominick Black of Racine, Wis., after Rittenhouse arrived in Kenosha, according to a criminal complaint. According to the complaint: Black bought the rifle for Rittenhouse in May 2020, using money from Rittenhouse, and they agreed the rifle would be stored at Black’s stepfather’s house in Kenosha. Rittenhouse, who was 17 at the time, was too young to legally buy the gun in Wisconsin.  At Rittenhouse’s trial, Black testified that he bought the rifle for Rittenhouse and that they shot target practice together in a rural area.  On the day of the shootings, Black testified, Black invited Rittenhouse to join him at the Kenosha protest to protect a car dealership. Before they went to the protest, Black testified that they went together to the home of Black’s stepfather to get Rittenhouse’s gun. Black testified that he, his brother and Rittenhouse had gone to downtown Kenosha on the morning of the shootings to view the aftermath of the previous days’ violence, and that he and Rittenhouse returned to Black’s home before going back downtown about 5 p.m. Rittenhouse testified that he went to Kenosha with his sister and friends to provide first aid after seeing online pleas for people to come to the city to help protect it. Rittenhouse testified that after the shootings, Black drove him home in Antioch, where he told his mother and two sisters what happened. He said his mother drove him to the local police station, where he surrendered. Wendy Rittenhouse told the Chicago Tribune in November that she would have tried to stop her son from going to Kenosha, but she didn’t know where he was or what he was doing. A viral image claimed that Rittenhouse’s mother ""drove him across state lines and dropped him off in the middle of a riot armed with an assault rifle"" in Kenosha.  There is no evidence that Rittenhouse’s mother took him to Kenosha. The evidence is that Rittenhouse went on his own from his Illinois home to Kenosha, and that he retrieved the rifle he used in the shootings, which had been purchased by his friend, from the Kenosha home of the friend’s stepfather",False,"November 15, 2021"
President Joe Biden threatened to “swoop down with Special Forces folks and gather up every gun in America.”,"Less than six months after the December 2012 elementary school shooting in Newtown, Conn., left 28 people dead, then-Vice President Joe Biden stood before reporters to talk about proposed gun control legislation. Though Biden was describing what he called a campaign of disinformation by the National Rifle Association, social media users have since stripped his comments of context to make it seem like he is threatening to have the government seize people’s guns. A viral Facebook post shows a 26-second clip of Biden saying, ""No way that Uncle Sam can go find out whether you own a gun because we’re about to really take away all your rights and you’re not going to be able to defend yourself and we’re going to swoop down with Special Forces folks and gather up every gun in America.""

The video has a text overlay that suggests the statement was spoken as a threat: ""This is how I see this going if u try,"" it reads before cutting to a drill sergeant yelling in a clip from the movie ""Full Metal Jacket."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Biden did make that remark in April 2013, but the post does not include his comments before or after that statement, which make it clear he was describing what he believed to be misinformation about the gun control legislation, not proposed actions by the government.  About five minutes before the comment featured in the Facebook post, at the 27:15 mark in Biden’s full speech, Biden began explaining that the National Rifle Association was engaging in a campaign of disinformation, and he talked extensively about the false ideas the organization was spreading about proposed background checks for purchasing guns. At the time of his speech, the Manchin-Toomey gun proposal was under consideration by Congress and would have mandated criminal background checks on all sales between private parties with limited exceptions. The proposal was later defeated. Biden said the NRA was falsely claiming that the federal government wanted to create a federal registry of people who’ve purchased guns. Mocking the detractors, he says, ""Black helicopter crowd really is upset."" His comment about Special Forces came at the 32:04 mark in his full speech. Until then, he had been describing and debunking claims about the proposed gun control legislation. Then he said: ""No central registry for anything. No way that Uncle Sam can go find out whether you own a gun because we’re about to really take away all your rights and you’re not going to be able to defend yourself and we’re going to swoop down with Special Forces folks and gather up every gun in America. It’s bizarre. But that’s what’s being sold out there."" A conservative news outlet noted at the time that Biden was speaking mockingly. A Facebook post claims that President Joe Biden threatened to ""swoop down with Special Forces folks and gather up every gun in America."" The claim shows a seconds-long clip from a much longer speech that Biden delivered, when he described and debunked claims about proposed gun control legislation.

“Violent crime rate dropped like a rock following West Virginia’s adoption of permitless carry.”,"Did West Virginia’s passage of a permitless open carry law for guns produce a precipitous drop in violent crime in the state? That’s what an image on Facebook said. In 2016, West Virginia lawmakers passed a law that allowed most individuals over the age of 21 to carry a firearm without a permit or safety training. When the law was passed, some critics warned that it would lead to an increase in violent crime. ""Violent crime rate dropped like a rock following West Virginia’s adoption of permitless carry,"" said the Sept. 20 post, which was attributed to a group called Clergy in Support of the Second Amendment. An accompanying chart shows violent crime rates for the United States and West Virginia, with a drop for the U.S. but a bigger decline for West Virginia after the law was passed. ""Every time a state has expanded the right to carry firearms for self defense, gun control groups have predicted a massive increase in violent crime and murder as a result,"" the post goes on to say. ""Not once has this happened."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) When we looked at the crime rate in West Virginia after the law was passed, we found a more complicated story. (We reached out to Clergy in Support of the Second Amendment but did not hear back.) The chart in question used statistics for the violent crime rate, which are collected annually by the FBI from local law enforcement offices. Four types of crime are included: homicide, rape, aggravated assault, and robbery. Between 2017, the first full year after the law was in effect, and 2018, the number of violent crimes did decrease by about 60 per 100,000 people. However, the chart in the post stops at 2018, and that means it is cherry-picked to leave out a subsequent increase in violent crime, with data that was available at the time the post was published. In both 2019 and 2020, violent crime went up, and the rate now stands around the same level as it was before the decrease.    Meanwhile, criminologists cautioned that the violent crime rate is a blunt statistic for measuring gun crimes. ""The vast majority of violent crime are aggravated assaults,"" said James Alan Fox, a Northeastern University criminologist. ""Many of these are domestic or involve acquaintances. This would not be impacted"" by a permitless carry law. Jay Corzine, a sociology professor at University of Central Florida whose research focuses on homicide and violent crime, agreed. He said most aggravated assaults do not get reported, and that rape statistics are unreliable.  He said that homicide rates may be a better statistic, although not a perfect one. ""For homicide, you’ve got a body,"" said Corzine. ""That calls for an investigation."" So how did the homicide rate change in West Virginia after passage of the law? The statewide homicide rate decreased slightly in 2018, before increasing during the next two years. (The national homicide rate also increased over the same period.)   Looking at the data this way, Corzine said, ""I don’t see any reason to believe the law had an impact."" The post said that ""violent crime rate dropped like a rock following West Virginia’s adoption of permitless carry."" This is a selective representation of the data. After an initial decline in 2017 and 2018, violent crime rose again in 2019 and 2020 and is now back around its level prior to the law being passed. In addition, experts say that the violent crime rate is an imperfect statistic to use for tracking gun crimes. Another statistic, the homicide rate, may be a better indicator, and it did not see the big drop in 2017 and 2018 that was found for violent crime. And like the violent crime rate in West Virginia, the homicide rate has also gone up in 2019 and 2020",Mostly False,"November 2, 2021"

(Read more about PolitiFact's partnership with TikTok.) ##patriot ##freedom ##nwo ##gun ##2ndadmendment ##hunter ##conspiracy The video shows a letter addressed to Biden by a group of Republican senators. One thing to note: The letter did not make the same claim as the video. The group wrote in asking for clarification about a statement from William Malzahn, the deputy director for the Office of Conventional Arms Threat Reduction, which is part of the State Department. Malzahn spoke at the Seventh Conference of State Parties to the Arms Trade Treaty in early September. The senators said that during his statement, Malzahn indicated the Biden administration’s intention to rejoin the United Nations’ Arms Trade Treaty.  The treaty regulates international trade of small arms like rifles and pistols, battle tanks, combat aircraft and warships. The Arms Control Association wrote that it ""requires all states-parties to adopt basic regulations and approval processes for the flow of weapons across international borders,"" among other requirements. In 2013 under the Obama administration, the United States signed the Arms Trade Treaty, but the Senate never ratified it. In 2019, former President Donald Trump ""unsigned"" the treaty in front of a crowd at an annual National Rifle Association convention, an organization that has been against the treaty for years based on their stance that it could affect American gun owners. The Republican senators pointed out a particular sentence in Malzahn’s statement. Malzahn said, ""The United States has long supported strong and effective national controls on the international transfer of conventional arms, and the Arms Trade Treaty is an important tool for promoting those controls internationally.""  ""We find this statement to be most concerning and contrary to the current and historical position of the United States,"" the senators wrote. While the TikTok claim that the Biden administration wants to create an international oversight committee is based on this letter, that doesn’t mean it’s accurate. PolitiFact reached out to the office of Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kan., who along with other senators signed the letter. A spokesperson for Marshall’s office said the letter does not accuse the Biden administration of trying to create an international committee to oversee Second Amendment rights, but simply asked for clarification if Biden intends to join the treaty. The White House also told PolitiFact that the TikTok claim is wrong.  A State Department spokesperson said the Arms Trade Treaty regulates the international trade of conventional arms — not domestic trade or possession. In his remarks, Malzahn said that the Biden administration is going to finalize the U.S. Conventional Arms Transfer Policy, which was revised during both the Obama and Trump administrations.  ""President Biden has made clear that diplomacy and human rights are at the center of U.S. foreign policy,"" Malzahn said in his remarks. ""We believe it’s important to publicly reflect these changes in a new CAT Policy, so we have been working to revise the policy to reflect the new administration’s priorities.""  Malzahn then said when the policy is finalized and released, the U.S. will then address other arms transfer issues, like determining its relationship with the Arms Trade Treaty. But those remarks don’t mean that a decision has already been made to join the treaty — simply that a review of that relationship is going to happen, said the State Department spokesperson.   A TikTok post claimed that the Biden administration wants to create an international oversight committee to oversee U.S. Second Amendment rights and decide if they need to be altered or cancelled. The claim stems from a letter that Republican senators addressed to Biden asking for clarification of comments during a United Nations conference from a State Department official. The senators said these comments indicated that the Biden administration would rejoin the Arms Trade Treaty, which they were concerned could impede American gun owners’ rights. But the letter was not accusing the Biden administration of creating an international oversight committee to regulate U.S. gun rights. The White House affirmed that the creation of such a committee is not in the works",False,"November 1, 2021"
"""No other country on the planet witnesses the number of gun deaths that
we do here in the United States, and it’s not even close.""","Is the United States so awash in guns that gun violence has become a public health crisis?  Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told CNN in a late August interview that she wants the agency to treat gun violence that way.  State Sen. Melissa Agard, D-Madison, is on board, issuing a Sept. 2, 2021 news release that hailed the agency for ""acknowledging the stark reality of too many lives lost each day.""  She went on to make this claim:  ""The fact is, no other country on the planet witnesses the number of gun deaths that we do here in the United States, and it’s not even close."" Is Agard right? When asked for backup, Agard’s staff pointed us to various studies examining the level of gun violence in the United States and in other countries, including studies on mass shootings, gun ownership, and the number of children shot and killed. For instance according to a 2017 Pew Research Center study, about four in 10 Americans say they either own a gun or live in a home with guns -- the highest level among the nations surveyed.  But Agard’s claim was about gun deaths, not gun ownership. And the way she phrased it -- flat out most in the world, without any qualifications -- means she is a bit off. Let’s start with the raw numbers. According to the World Population Review ""Gun Deaths By Country 2021"" report,  Brazil topped the list of the most gun deaths, with a total of 43,200 out of the 250,000 deaths worldwide. The United States had the second-highest number of gun deaths with 37,200.  The report noted that in the U.S., mass shootings receive a great deal of media attention, however, they account for a small number of overall gun violence deaths. So, by that measure, Agard is close -- the U.S. ranks second, but is certainly not ""far and away"" in first. Of course, countries are of various sizes. So, what about deaths as a proportion of the population?  There Agard fares even worse. A March 24, 2021 NPR article cited data from the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation and noted ""the U.S. has the 32nd-highest rate of deaths from gun violence in the world: 3.96 deaths per 100,000 people in 2019."" At the top of the list were a series of Central and South American countries, starting with El Salvador (36.77 per 100,000), followed by Venezuela (33.27), Guatemala (29.06), Colombia (26.36) and Brazil (21.92 per 100,000.)  Other high-ranking countries included the Bahamas, Honduras and Mexico. Researchers noted that a large factor in gun violence in Central America and the Caribbean is a high level of gangs and drug trafficking. Venezuela, meanwhile, has struggled with political unrest and economic problems. The report, released in 2020, noted that deaths from gun violence can be rare in many low-income countries — such as Tajikistan and Gambia, which saw 0.18 deaths and 0.22 deaths, respectively, per 100,000 people. But wealthy Asian countries such as Singapore (0.01), Japan (0.02) and South Korea (0.02) have the absolute lowest rates — along with China, also at 0.02. So, by this measure, Agard is way off. What happens if you narrow the examination to countries that are larger, or more developed?  In a March 2021 article, the University of Washington Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation focused strictly on gun homicides (so, not including gun-related suicides) among 64 high-income countries and territories. The U.S. ranked 8th with two U.S. territories -- Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands -- coming in first and third. (Bahamas was second). When the institute narrowed it further, and looked at high-income countries and territories with populations of 10 million or more, the U.S. did come out on top. United States 4.12 per 100,000 population Chile 1.82 Canada 0.5 Portugal 0.4 Italy 0.35 Greece 0.35 Belgium 0.34 France 0.32 Sweden 0.25 Netherlands 0.23 So, by this specific measure, the U.S. was on top, and far ahead of the next countries. But, of course, Agard did not specify that measure. She spoke in the most general terms. Agard said ""the fact is, no other country on the planet witnesses the number of gun deaths that we do here in the United States, and it’s not even close."" The U.S. does top the list when only high-income developed nations with populations of 10 million or more are considered.  However, Agard is off by a bit when looking at raw numbers, and off by a whole lot when looking at gun-related deaths as a share of the population",Mostly False,"September 17, 2021"
The Biden administration “gifted the Taliban with $80 billion-plus” in military-grade weapons but now “wants your 9mm pistols.”,"A popular take on Facebook is that the Biden administration, with its withdrawal from Afghanistan, in effect armed the Taliban and yet, wants to take handguns away from Americans.  ""The current regime that just gifted the Taliban with $80+ billion worth of military grade weapons wants your 9mm pistols,"" a viral image claims. ""THINK ABOUT IT."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The claim was made amid reports of the Taliban having seized U.S. attack planes, Black Hawk helicopters and other vehicles and equipment. But the United States has spent $88.6 billion in Afghanistan for providing security over the course of two decades, and only a fraction of it was for hardware — so there is no way that more than $80 billion in weaponry was left behind. Meanwhile, Biden has not called for banning traditional handguns such as pistols, much less made any statements about confiscating them. The recent U.S. involvement in Afghanistan followed the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, against the U.S. The attacks had been enabled by al-Qaida’s use of Afghanistan as its base.  After the attacks, the U.S. teamed up with Afghan allies to oust the al-Qaida-aligned governing Taliban and, eventually, stand up what was intended to be a more inclusive government.  In August 2021, as U.S. troops left, the American-backed Afghan army and government collapsed within about two weeks from the start of a Taliban offensive, and the Taliban resumed control of the country. The U.S. has allocated $88.6 billion to the Defense Department for equipment, supplies, services, training and funding for salaries, as well as facility and infrastructure repair, renovation and construction for providing security in Afghanistan. That’s according to the latest quarterly report, released July 30, 2021, by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction. That office was created by Congress to oversee the spending. As of June 30, 2021, there were 167 usable aircraft, including 23 A-29 attack planes and 33 UH-60 Black Hawk military helicopters in Afghanistan. But there has been no full accounting of how much aircraft or other military equipment was still there in mid-August, when the Taliban regained control. Defense expert John Pike, director of GlobalSecurity.org, said ""very little"" of the $88.6 billion would have been spent on equipment. He estimated that the military equipment remaining is worth less than $10 billion, though virtually all of it could be considered under the category of weapons. As for the second part of the claim, which suggests Biden wants to confiscate 9-millimeter pistols, during the 2020 presidential campaign we rated False a statement by the NRA that Biden wants to ban 9-millimeter pistols. Biden had said people don’t need to own ""military-style weapons,"" including pistols with 9-millimeter bullets that can hold 10 or more rounds. He was talking about banning high-capacity magazines, not the gun itself. Biden’s gun policies don’t call for outlawing traditional handguns such as pistols",False,"August 20, 2021"
"Every time outgoing New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo “says the firearm industry ‘is immune from lawsuits,’ it's false.”","In July, several weeks before he resigned amid multiple allegations of sexual harassment, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed a law that seeks to hold gun manufacturers liable for the harm their products cause. The law targets the illegal or improper marketing or sale of guns, opening their manufacturers up to civil lawsuits on the ground that the weapons pose a ""nuisance."" The law is a workaround to a 2005 federal law signed by then-President George W. Bush, the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, which largely shields the firearms industry from liability over shooting deaths. During a press conference to announce the bill’s signing, Cuomo said that the ""only industry in the United States of America immune from lawsuits are the gun manufacturers, thanks to George Bush and the NRA."" (The National Rifle Association is a pro-gun group that lobbied for the measure Bush signed.) Cuomo offered a similar comment in a news release announcing the signing. ""The only industry in the United States of America immune from lawsuits are the gun manufacturers,"" the release said. Later that day, Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., tweeted that Cuomo had his facts wrong. ""The Worst Governor in America once again attacks law-abiding Americans' Constitutional right to keep and bear arms. Every time Cuomo says the firearm industry ‘is immune from lawsuits,’ it's false."" The Worst Governor in America once again attacks law-abiding Americans' Constitutional right to keep and bear arms. Every time Cuomo says the firearm industry ""is immune from lawsuits,” it's false.

""If it's false for Biden to make this claim, then it is also false for Cuomo to make this claim,"" said Francis Brennan, a spokesperson for Stefanik. Brennan called the tweet ""100% accurate."" So who’s right, Cuomo or Stefanik? Stefanik is closer to accurate, we found. In 2015, PolitiFact gave then-presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton a False for a statement similar to Cuomo’s — that the gun industry is ""the only business in America that is wholly protected from any kind of liability."" The 2005 law provides wide legal protection for gun manufacturers and dealers. For example, if a person buys a gun legally and then uses the gun to intentionally kill someone, the gun dealer and manufacturer cannot be held liable for the crime. However, the immunity for manufacturers and dealers is not all-encompassing.  The federal law lists several situations where there is no legal immunity. For instance, the law does not protect gun dealers who transfer a gun knowing it would be used for criminal purposes, or those who knowingly break state or federal law if the violation results in harm. Gun manufacturers can also be sued if a gun, when used properly, causes injury because of a product defect, such as if the gun explodes when fired. Jake Charles, executive director of Duke’s Center for Firearms Law, said the federal law also has some exceptions that allow lawsuits in certain situations, ""if, for example, the dealer or manufacturer broke laws regulating the sale or marketing or firearms."" These provisions would come into play if the New York law is challenged in court, as is considered likely. John Goldberg, a Harvard Law professor, said he understands what Cuomo was getting at, even if his language wasn’t precise. ""If he (Cuomo) was asserting that gun manufacturers are never, ever subject to liability, then what he said is not accurate,"" Goldberg said. Scenarios like an exploding gun ""are not ones that politicians are arguing about."" Charles agreed. ""It’s true the firearms industry is not immune from lawsuits."" he said. ""Certain components of the firearms industry are, however, shielded from civil lawsuits to a degree that almost no other industry or market is.""  While Stefanik didn’t note it, Cuomo’s statement included another inaccuracy — that guns are ""the only industry"" with broad protection from lawsuits. The act ""is not the first federal law to grant a particular industry immunity from tort liability,"" Timothy Lytton, a law professor at Georgia State University who edited a book on gun industry litigation, told PolitiFact in 2015. For instance, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act blocks victims of online defamation from suing service providers, like Comcast, and content providers, like YouTube, for failing to monitor or remove defamatory posts uploaded by customers. In addition, under a law passed in the 1980s, victims of injuries that they say were caused by defective vaccines are not allowed to sue vaccine manufacturers. The law established the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, through which alleged victims can make a claim and receive compensation. There’s also some liability protection in the medical devices and airline industries, Walter Olson, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, told us in 2015. For example,the 1994 General Aviation Revitalization Act said makers of small planes cannot be sued over accidents involving aircraft more than 18 years old. Stefanik tweeted that every time Cuomo ""says the firearm industry ‘is immune from lawsuits,’ it's false."" Stefanik is basically right. The 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act grants gun manufacturers some immunity from lawsuits, but it does allow some suits to proceed, depending on the grounds for the lawsuit.  It’s also not accurate for Cuomo to say that the gun industry is alone in this protection; several other industries have similar protections, including service and content providers, vaccine makers, and general aviation manufacturers. That said, the federal lawsuit protection that Cuomo was referencing — immunity from suits stemming from killings by firearms — are the most hotly contested aspect of the law in the policy arena",Mostly True,"August 13, 2021"
Florida Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried “suspended gun rights — no due process — just because she says these people were merely ‘involved’ in January 6.”,"Florida Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried suspended gun permits for nearly two dozen people charged with crimes related to the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. ""The deeply disturbing events that occurred at our nation’s Capitol on January 6 were sedition, treason, and domestic terrorism — and those individuals involved in the insurrection must be held accountable for attempting to subvert our democratic process,"" Fried said in a July 27 statement.  Fried runs the state department that oversees gun permits, including concealed carry licenses. Fried, Florida’s only statewide Democrat officeholder, is running in the 2022 Democratic primary for governor. A conservative Florida attorney criticized the gun permit suspensions on Facebook. ""She suspended ‘gun rights’ — no due process — just because she says these people were merely ‘involved’ in January 6,"" wrote KrisAnne Hall, a Florida attorney who hosts a podcast and gives lectures on the Constitution. ""Did they have a trial? Were they convicted of a crime?"" Fried did use the word ""involved"" in a press release describing the permit holders actions on Jan. 6. But it’s wrong to suggest that Fried suspended their permits just because they were ""involved."" State law calls for suspending gun permits when people are charged with serious offenses. The post is also wrong to claim that due process rights have been ignored. These Floridians will have an opportunity to request a hearing about the suspension. The Facebook post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Florida is a ""shall issue"" state, which makes it easier to get a gun permit than in some other states. There are 2.3 million concealed weapon permit holders. Criminal activity can cost someone their license, at least temporarily. State law requires the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services to suspend a concealed carry gun permit when a person is arrested or charged with a crime that would disqualify a person from having a license. This includes any felony offense as well as certain misdemeanors, such as multiple DUIs or drug crimes. For the most recent year ending in June 2021, the state revoked 1,050 licenses and suspended about 7,300. Under Florida law, a concealed weapon or firearm license is a private record — which means we don’t know which Jan. 6 defendants had their permits suspended, and so we also don’t know their specific charges. A spokesperson for the department would not reveal which charges were at play, saying it received the information about the defendants from the U.S. Department of Justice. Suspensions are a temporary action — an interim step to a potential revocation. And state law spells out the mandate for suspensions. It says when the department is notified by a law enforcement agency or a court, it shall suspend a license of a person arrested or charged with a crime that would disqualify the person from having a license until final disposition of the case. Also, the department shall suspend a license of a person who is issued an injunction that restrains the person from committing acts of domestic violence or repeat violence. The Justice Department has charged more than 550 people in connection with the Capitol siege, according to a database run by the George Washington University Center on Extremism. Charges include obstruction of law enforcement, violence with a deadly weapon, assault, and unlawful possession of a firearm on Capitol grounds. The largest number of defendants — 63 — came from Florida, according to the university’s database. Some of the Floridians include: Kevin Tuck, a Windermere police officer who has since resigned. He was indicted on multiple offenses including obstruction of an official proceeding and disorderly and disruptive conduct in a restricted building. Adam Johnson, who was photographed carrying Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s lectern during the riot. He was charged with knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority and violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds. Joseph Biggs, a member of the neofascist group the Proud Boys. He was charged with multiple counts including destruction of government property and violent and disorderly conduct. Paul Hodgkins of Tampa, who was seen in the Senate chamber taking selfies, and was the first defendant to be sentenced for a felony charge. Relating to due process, Florida law says that the agriculture department must send a notice of suspension to the permit holder, who then has a few weeks to request a hearing. So far, one suspended permit holder has requested a hearing, said Erin Moffet, a spokesperson for Fried.  If permit holders want to present evidence that they were not charged with a disqualifying offense, they could do so. The number of suspended licenses could go up or down depending on the outcome of cases. As of Aug. 2, the number of suspended permits was 23. In an email interview about her Facebook post, Hall cited part of the law that points to felonies or drug crimes as disqualifying offenses for gun permits. ""The majority of these people have not been charged with crimes that would disqualify them from having a license, therefore they are not eligible for suspension or revocation without actual conviction of a greater crime,"" Hall said in an email. ""Therefore, neither the law nor due process have been served."" We asked Hall how she knows that the majority of these people have not been charged with disqualifying offenses since the names of the permit holders are private and did not get a reply to that question. She is wrong to suggest there is no due process since the permit holders have a right to a hearing.  Daniel W. Webster, a professor at the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Prevention and Policy, said there isn’t a lot of data to examine offending rates of concealed carry permit holders compared with the public at large.  ""But I think it is still safe to say that, as a group, permit holders are very law-abiding,"" Webster said. ""What people fail to appreciate is that this is simply a reflection of group average. Within that large group, there are clearly subgroups of individuals with much higher risks for violent offending. Participating in a violent insurrection may well be a marker for risks for committing acts of violence.""  A Facebook post said that Fried ""suspended gun rights — no due process — just because she says these people were merely ‘involved’ in January 6.""  The post wrongly suggests that Fried suspended gun permits based on the participants’ mere involvement in the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. The post ignores what Florida law actually says: Fried’s department is required to suspend gun permits for disqualifying offenses, which includes violent crimes. Since the names of permit holders are a private record in Florida, we can’t independently evaluate their charges to confirm that they are disqualifying offenses under state law. However, under state law, they have a right to request a hearing to challenge their suspensions",Mostly False,"August 3, 2021"
“President Biden says he wants to ban handguns.”,"When President Joe Biden was asked in his Ohio town hall what he plans to do about rising homicides, House Republicans were quick to fire off a tweet to their followers. ""President Biden says he wants to ban handguns,"" the House GOP account tweeted July 21. 🚨🚨🚨 MUST-WATCH 🚨🚨🚨President Biden says he wants to ban handguns. House Republicans will NEVER allow this to happen the #SecondAmendment is a RIGHT. pic.twitter.com/rOq6wecQES The tweet included a video clip from the CNN town hall-style event where Biden was speaking. That clip doesn’t back up the GOP tweet, and the full transcript goes further to sink this claim. Biden’s response followed a question from Andrea Solis Canto, a Cincinnati paralegal, about the spike in homicides. ""Gun violence has taken the lives of so many young students and young people,"" she said. ""I’m tired, and I want to see change that’s going to make our cities, like Cincinnati, safer."" Biden first noted that while crime generally is down, murders and gun violence are up. There’s always a sizable lag in national crime statistics, but based on what’s known today, Biden is broadly correct. Many cities have seen trends like the ones in Cincinnati. In the past three years, homicides are up 17%, while other serious violent crimes such as rapes and robberies are down more than 20%, according to the city’s police department. Biden's main focus, though, was on guns. ""The idea you need a weapon that can have the ability to fire 20, 30, 40, 50, 120 shots from that weapon, whether it’s a 9-millimeter pistol or whether it’s a rifle, is ridiculous,"" Biden said. ""I’m continuing to push to eliminate the sale of those things."" Those numbers Biden used apply to assault-style firearms and high-capacity magazines. As recently as June, when Biden rolled out his strategy to bring down murders, he said he wants to ban both. Experts disagree over what is or isn’t an assault weapon. States set different thresholds for what qualifies as a high-capacity magazine. But regardless of the definition, neither term includes all handguns.  For example, the Sig Sauer P365 was ranked the most popular handgun in a 2020 survey of Alabama gun dealers. The NRA’s Shooting Illustrated Magazine named it the Handgun of the Year. The standard magazine for the P365 is 10 rounds, and depending on the model, the weapon can accommodate a 15-round magazine. Nothing Biden said would curtail the purchase of the Sig Sauer P365. Nor would his policies touch any of the 15 standard handguns in the Alabama survey. It is possible that some models of pistols would be affected. There are designs that bridge the gap between handgun and rifle, and are built to accommodate larger magazines. But they represent a subset of firearms, and barring them would not constitute a ban on all handguns. In the rest of his answer, Biden talked about his focus on black-market suppliers to stop the flow of illegal firearms.  ""It's not because the gun shops in the cities are selling these guns,"" Biden said. ""They are either shadow gun dealers and/or gun shops that are not abiding by the law."" Again, that effort would not bar the legal sale of handguns. The House Republican video clip included none of Biden’s expanded answer. We reached out to the House Republicans and did not hear back. House Republicans said Biden wants to ban handguns. That is incorrect. Biden was talking about banning assault weapons and magazines that carry 20 to 120 rounds of ammunition. Those policies would not affect the most popular handgun models. Even if some smaller set of pistols came under such a ban, that would not translate to a ban on handguns across the board",False,"July 22, 2021"
"News organizations and sponsors ignored the accomplishments of Kim Rhode, a six-time Olympic medalist, because of her support of the Second Amendment.","With the delayed 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games around the corner, an old claim has resurfaced online about Kim Rhode, a six-time Olympic medalist in the sport of shooting. ""First woman to medal in six straight olympics,"" a June 30 Facebook post says. ""Media and sponsors ignore her because she is outspoken pro-2A.""    The claim first started to spread online in 2016, shortly after Rhode won her sixth medal for women’s skeet shooting. It’s just as wrong now as it was then. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) After her bronze medal win in 2016, Rhode became the first woman and first summer Olympian to medal in six consecutive Olympics. She didn’t qualify for the 2020 games. But it’s inaccurate to say that news organizations ignored Rhode’s success. Stories about the feat were published by multiple news organizations at the time, including CBS Sports, the Daily Mail, The Guardian, NBC, the New York Times, Reuters, SB Nation and USA Today. Outlets have also reported about her accomplishments and support of gun rights. It’s true that, in the past, Rhode hasn’t received sponsorships outside of the firearms industry and a hunters’ conservation group. But that appears to have more to do with shooting’s lack of fanfare compared to other Olympic sports, making it unattractive to big-name sponsors.  Shooters, including Rhode, have also suggested that the rise of gun violence and mass shootings in the U.S. has attached a stigma to the sport, and contributes to its sponsorship problems. ""When you look at the gun debate and the Olympics, there definitely is that stigmatism that’s attached to our sport due to all the negative publicity that guns get,"" Rhode told the Daily Signal in 2016. A Facebook post claims that Rhode was ignored by news organizations and sponsors because she’s an outspoken supporter of the Second Amendment. There is no evidence to support this. Several prominent news outlets have reported about Rhode’s Olympic accomplishments, as well as her support of gun rights. The sport of shooting often receives less big-name sponsors due to its lack of fanfare, and isn’t about Rhode specifically. She and other shooters have also suggested that the sponsorship issues may be due to an aversion to gun sports",False,"July 9, 2021"

"""The Second Amendment, from the day it was passed, limited the type of people who could own a gun and what type of weapon you could own.”","President Joe Biden’s plan to curb rising violence relies on several steps: more aid to local police departments, expanding job programs for young adults, more violence intervention programs, and tougher measures to shut down gun sellers who break federal laws. ""Rogue gun dealers feel like they can get away with selling guns to people who aren’t legally allowed to own them,"" Biden said June 23. ""There has always been the ability to limit — rationally limit the type of weapon that can be owned and who can own it."" And, Biden said, that power was rooted in history. ""The Second Amendment, from the day it was passed, limited the type of people who could own a gun and what type of weapon you could own,"" Biden said. ""You couldn’t buy a cannon."" We reached out to the White House and received no comment, but Biden’s statement is not accurate history. During the campaign, Biden made a similar claim about cannons in the Revolutionary War and who could own them. We rated that False.  This time, on top of that, Biden misrepresents what the Second Amendment says. The text of the Second Amendment is short: ""A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed."" University of Tennessee law professor Glenn Harlan Reynolds said the amendment’s few words speak for themselves. ""The Second Amendment places no limits on individual ownership of cannon, or any other arms,"" Reynolds said. There have been many court cases to resolve whether the amendment confers an individual right to bear arms. In 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that it does.  Setting aside ongoing disagreements over that ruling, Fordham University law professor Nicholas Johnson said, ""The amendment limited government action, not people."" ""The first federal gun control law does not appear until the 20th century,"" Johnson said. That law, the National Firearms Act, came in 1934 when machine guns were the weapon of choice of Prohibition Era gangsters. (The law was drafted before Prohibition ended in 1933.) When U.S. Attorney General Homer Cummings made the case for the law before the House Ways and Means Committee, he based it on the government’s power to tax and regulate interstate commerce, not the Second Amendment. ""If we made a statute absolutely forbidding any human being to have a machine gun, you might say there is some constitutional question involved,"" Cummings said April 16, 1934. ""But when you say ‘We will tax the machine gun’ and when you say that ‘the absence of a license showing payment of the tax has been made indicates that a crime has been perpetrated,’ you are easily within the law."" From the way Biden put it, the Second Amendment regulated weapons. The more immediate driver in 1787 was the desire to keep the federal government in check. The framers of the Constitution agreed that a federal government might need a standing army. But coming out from under one despot, they wanted to avoid creating another. This was something that Federalists and Anti-Federalists could agree on, wrote Valparaiso law professor David Vandercoy. ""Both believed the greatest danger to the new republic was tyrannical government and that the ultimate check on tyranny was an armed population,"" Vandercoy wrote in 1994. There were some state and local laws after the Second Amendment was adopted in 1792 that limited firearms. The most sweeping ones barred Black people, free or enslaved, from owning them.  A 1792 Virginia law, for example, said, ""No Negro or mulatto whatsoever shall keep or carry any gun, powder, shot, club or other weapon whatsoever.""  Historian Saul Cornell at Fordham found other laws aimed at controlling certain groups. Some banned gun ownership by people who backed the British. Others targeted Native Americans.  Cornell also pointed to a 1795 Massachusetts law that mainly targeted rioters but gave local authorities broad latitude to arrest people who carried firearms. ""The (National Rifle Association) will call out Biden, correctly, that there were no modern style gun control laws in the Founding era because there was little interpersonal gun violence among persons of European origin,"" Cornell said. ""Gun control groups will correctly say that a variety of robust regulations existed at the time of the Second Amendment and that the Founders feared anarchy as much as tyranny."" Cornell argues that for about the first 50 years after passage of the Second Amendment, gun technology was limited. The issues of crime and safety that drive the modern debate, he said, didn’t begin to emerge until manufacturers began producing reliable, affordable guns in greater volume. Biden said that from the start, the Second Amendment ""limited the type of people who could own a gun and what type of weapon you could own."" The Second Amendment limited government power, not the rights of individuals. Laws at the time that limited firearm ownership were primarily racist, aimed at controlling Black people and Native Americans.  Broadly, gun regulation came decades after passage of the Second Amendment when gun technology changed. The first national gun regulation law did not rely on the Second Amendment",False,"June 25, 2021"
"Says ATF chief nominee David Chipman was part of the 1993 assault on the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas.","After President Joe Biden nominated gun control advocate David Chipman to head the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, Chipman found himself linked to the bloody 1993 government siege in Waco, Texas, that left 76 civilians and five federal agents dead. Chipman, who spent two decades at the ATF, became a policy adviser to two national gun control groups, Mayors Against Illegal Guns and Giffords: Courage to Fight Gun Violence. The gun industry and gun rights supporters firmly oppose his nomination.  Days after Biden announced Chipman as his pick, the London tabloid Daily Mail posted a photograph of a man in camouflage pants, holding an assault rifle, standing in the middle of the smoking wreckage of Waco. The caption read: ""Pictured is a young Chipman, who worked as an ATF agent for 25 years, posing in the aftermath of the Waco siege where 76 Branch Davidian members and five ATF agents died.""  The internet is rife with repetitions of the claim, and Chipman has received a torrent of death threats. But the evidence shows that he is not the man in the photo. Justice Department records indicate the photo is of an FBI agent and was taken on April 19, 1993. Chipman’s travel orders show that he wasn’t sent to Waco until early May, and he was not in the FBI. The Branch Davidians were a religious cult that stockpiled weapons and lived in a walled compound in Waco. In February 1993, an ATF raid to seize illegal weapons led to a shootout, followed by a protracted siege as federal and state agents, led by the FBI, encircled the property.  On the morning of April 19, 1993, federal forces advanced. A fire erupted inside the compound. Most of the men, women and children inside died. The events in Waco became a symbol of government oppression — a symbol so powerful, it inspired the revenge bombing of a federal building in Oklahoma City two years later on April 19, 1995, that killed 168 people, including 19 children. On the day of Chipman’s confirmation hearing, a Republican politician in Maine tweeted the photo saying, ""We all remember Chipman’s time in Central Texas."" Let us be clear: It wasn’t him in that picture. Chipman said so at his May 26 confirmation hearing.  He was sent to Waco, he said, but as part of an ATF investigation team, two weeks after the fire. ""I was selected, because I had no involvement in the actual case that was being examined,"" Chipman said. The paper trail backs Chipman up. The picture circulating on the Internet bears the label USAWDTX 093-01048. That first part of that label tracks the photo back to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Texas.  After the siege, two court cases followed. The first was a criminal trial against surviving members of the Branch Davidians. The second, seven years later, was a civil suit on behalf of the Branch Davidians against the federal government. The Justice Department shared the photo, along with many others, as part of both proceedings. Former Dallas Morning News reporter Lee Hancock covered the entire Waco story for over a decade. She found a read-only CD in her files marked with the Justice Department’s seal and the words ""90 photos of HRT During Waco standoff through 4/19/1993.""  A Justice Department CD with photos from the Waco siege. (Lee Hancock) It is one of the Justice Department’s archives of photos from the siege, produced for the 2000 civil lawsuit. ""HRT is the FBI’s Hostage Rescue Team,"" Hancock told PolitiFact. ""They were a tactical unit on the scene, some of them as negotiators, and some as sharpshooters, all the way through."" The photo in question is stored on that disk.    The file index on the Justice Department CD of Waco photos. (Lee Hancock)    The photo of an FBI agent on the Justice Department CD of Waco photos. (Lee Hancock) The label differs from the one on the photo posted by the Daily Mail because it was for the second trial, not the first. But otherwise, it’s the same photo. The man in the picture, whom we weren’t able to identify, was with the FBI’s Hostage Rescue Team. Chipman was with the ATF, so he can’t be the one in the photo. In 2012, one of the leading critics of the FBI action, independent investigator and documentary maker Mike McNulty, described this and two other photos taken in the same spot at the same time as, ""The spirit of the FBI HRT during the Waco experience can be seen in the following pictures of three of the ‘Snipers’ posing in these ‘trophy’ shots."" One of the men in the other photos is wearing an FBI armband. One final detail: From the date printed on the Justice Department CD, along with the smoke rising from the ruins, the photo can be dated to April 19, 1993. On that day, Chipman, who was stationed at the ATF field office in Norfolk, Va., received a fax from the ATF associate director directing him and four other ATF agents to get to Waco by May 2.    1993 fax with the travel orders for David Chipman to report to Waco, Texas, by May 2, 1993. (David Chipman) Gun rights activists were quick to follow the Daily Mail’s lead in wrongly tying Chipman to Waco. Will Fite, a regional director with the National Association of Gun Rights tweeted the photo April 8, saying ""This is the man who Joe Biden just nominated to lead the ATF standing on the rubble and ashes of the Americans the ATF burned alive in Waco."" Larry Keane, the chief lobbyist for National Shooting Sports Foundation, an industry trade group, repeated the Daily Mail’s claim in a GunGuyTV post, and reminded readers that the dead at Waco ""were Americans, some innocent children."" A pro-Trump forum Patriots Win posted the photo. One comment said, ""Mass murderer. American Nazi."" Multiple tweets, blog posts and articles assert that Chipman is the man in the photo of a government agent standing in the rubble of the Waco siege. Government filings prove that the photo dates from April 19, 1993, and that the man was a member of the FBI Hostage Rescue Team.  Chipman was in Norfolk, Va., on April 19, 1993, and served with the ATF, not the FBI.

The March 30th post was flagged as part of efforts by Facebook, which owns Instagram, to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Iterations of the Instagram post in question have resurfaced through the years and caught the attention of fact-checkers. Snopes published a Nov. 11, 2017, fact-check based on a similar post and called it mostly false.  We found that while the governments cited in these societies did confiscate guns from certain people, there’s no evidence to conclude that those confiscations were directly responsible for the millions of deaths that happened afterward, as the post claims. The central claim driving this post — that gun control enabled genocide — is a popular talking point for the National Rifle Association and other opponents of gun control. But the theory has been disputed by historians and researchers as hypothetical, and as exaggerating the role personal gun ownership by civilians could have played in counteracting the power of authoritarian governments and their militaries. The concept ""suggests, for example, that the Holocaust could have been avoided if Germany's minuscule Jewish population had been better armed. It also argues that Ukrainian peasants could have defeated the Stalinist regime, backed by the NKVD and the Red Army, if they had possessed individual firearms,"" Mark Nuckols, an instructor with Russian Academy of National Economy and Public Administration, wrote in The Atlantic magazine. Under Nazi Germany’s 1938 regulations, Jews living under the Third Reich were forbidden to own or possess any form of weapons, including truncheons, knives, firearms and ammunition. But the Nazis had already been raiding Jewish homes by then, and ""the small number of personal firearms in the hands of the small number of Germany’s Jews (about 214,000) remaining in Germany in 1938 could in no way have stopped the totalitarian power of the Nazi German state,"" the Anti-Defamation League explained in 2013. In the Soviet Union, ""tens of thousands of people were shot by Soviet state police and hundreds of thousands deported,"" Yale University history professor wrote a March 2011 New York Review article. ""Those who remained lost their land and often went hungry as the state requisitioned food for export."" However, the greatest casualty figure of the Soviet era had nothing to do with access to firearms. Instead, it stemmed from a government-imposed famine which killed at least 5 million people, Snyder wrote. In Turkey’s 1915 offensive against ethnic Armenians, also cited in the post, the Armenians ""were ordered to turn in any weapons that they owned to the authorities,"" according to a New York Times article, citing David Fromkin’s book ""A Peace to End All Peace,"" about World War I, though it was mostly military members, not civilians, who were allowed to own firearms to begin with.  ""I don’t know of any evidence which shows causality"" between gun confiscation and genocide, Philip Alpers, an adjunct associate professor at the University of Sydney who studies gun laws and regulations, told PolitiFact in an email. A post on Instagram claims that ""56 million defenseless people"" were ""rounded up and exterminated"" in the 20th century because of gun control. The claim conflates gun control with confiscation. And it rests on the theory that gun confiscation policies by authoritarian governments left citizens defenseless and enabled genocide.  Researchers and historians say there’s no evidence to support the theory, and that it exaggerates the role armed civilians could have played in counteracting the power of authoritarian governments and their militaries",False,"April 9, 2021"
"“You go to a gun show, you can buy whatever you want, and no background check.""","In a Rose Garden event, President Joe Biden announced several actions his administration will take to address what he called an ""epidemic"" of gun violence. Biden repeated his call for Congress to pass legislation to expand background checks. The House voted largely along party lines to pass a pair of background check bills this year, but they haven’t moved forward in the Senate. ""These bills, one, require background checks for anyone purchasing a gun at a gun show or an online sale,"" Biden said at the April 8 event. ""Most people don't know it, you walk into a store and you buy a gun, you have a background check. But you go to a gun show, you can buy whatever you want, and no background check."" When it comes to background checks for gun purchases, what matters is who sells the guns, not where the guns are sold — and when a federally licensed seller is a vendor at a gun show, they have to run a background check just as they would if they were back at a bricks-and-mortar gun store. The White House told PolitiFact that Biden wasn’t suggesting that every gun transaction at a gun show would take place without a background check. Instead, he meant that sales without background checks could occur in some cases.  However, that's not what he said. Advocates for stricter gun control measures often talk about the ""gun show loophole,"" though some observers say the term is a misnomer. The phrase itself doesn’t explain who is and isn’t required to run background checks at gun shows.  Federal law requires that people in the business of dealing in firearms be licensed by the federal government. Specifically, the law says that a license is required if ""a person who devotes time, attention, and labor to dealing in firearms as a regular course of trade or business with the principal objective of livelihood and profit through the repetitive purchase and resale of firearms."" The law specifically rules out a required license if a person ""makes occasional sales, exchanges, or purchases of firearms for the enhancement of a personal collection or for a hobby, or who sells all or part of his personal collection of firearms."" This can sometimes be a fuzzy distinction, but it means many sellers of guns do need to have a license. ""Every federally licensed retailer, whether they are selling a gun at a brick and mortar store, a  gun show or the sale starts online,"" must complete a signed background check form from the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and get approval from the FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Check system, said Mark Oliva, a spokesperson for the National Shooting Sports Foundation. Gun shows can include either licensed dealers or private sellers. So at a gun show, the licensed sellers need to run a background check on buyers, and the non-licensed sellers don’t. So Biden’s blanket statement that if you go to a gun show, you can avoid a background check, is wrong. It depends on who you buy from. It’s also worth noting something that Biden’s statement ignores: A number of states have implemented additional background check requirements that cover at least some private sales. The states include some of the nation’s most populous, including California, New York and Illinois.  These states’ specific laws vary, but at least in the states with the strictest additional requirements, you will have to pass a background check for any gun you buy at a gun show, contrary to what Biden said. How common is it for licensed sellers to set up shop at gun shows? The available data is old and of uncertain accuracy, but what data we have shows that gun show vendors are often licensed sellers. Professors at Northeastern and Harvard universities conducted a gun survey in 2015 and found that 22% of gun owners who reported obtaining their most recent firearm within the previous two years reported doing so without a background check. For firearms purchased privately, including sales between individuals in person, online or at gun shows, 50% were obtained without a background check. Jay Corzine, a sociologist at the University of Central Florida who specializes in gun research, said that observations that he and his wife, fellow University of Central Florida sociologist Lin Huff-Corzine, have made in Florida in recent years suggest that licensed dealers have a ""disproportionate amount of the stock"" for sale at shows, accounting for roughly three-fourths of sales. Biden said, ""You go to a gun show, you can buy whatever you want, and no background check.""  This is overstated. If you go to a gun show and buy a firearm from a federally licensed seller, you will have to pass a background check, just as if you went to a bricks-and-mortar gun store. You would only escape a background check at a gun show if you bought from a seller who isn’t federally licensed. While the data is incomplete, federally licensed sellers have been found to make up a substantial share, and perhaps a majority, of gun show vendors",Mostly False,"April 8, 2021"
"In this photo, “Man uses a gun to rob a Texas convenience store.

A reverse image search revealed that this video originated in Brazil in May 2017. And this claim about the video featuring customers stopping an armed robber has been fact-checked before. According to accounts on ConcealedNation.org, Snopes.com and G1 Goiás, the image captured an attempted robbery at a pharmacy in Itumbiara, Brazil, that was stopped by plainclothes military police officers.  At the time, Brazil had strict gun ownership requirements, making it unlikely that a convenience store would have so many customers who were licensed gun owners if they weren’t police officers. The security camera footage shows that a person wearing a helmet walked into the store and pointed a gun at the cashier behind the counter. As the officers realized what was happening, they drew their weapons. In seconds, the person who attempted to rob the store is on the ground, shot.  The person who attempted to commit the robbery was a 17-year-old, and he was dead by the time emergency medical services arrived. According to the reports, it is unclear how many officers fired, but there is no evidence to support the claim that it was ""every customer inside the store.""  Concealed Nation, a website that says its purpose is ""promoting responsible concealed carry,"" accurately shared in 2017 that the incident occurred in Brazil. When sharing this story, the conservative news website Breitbart also noted that the event happened in Brazil.  A viral image post reads, ""Man uses a gun to rob a Texas convenience store. Man was shot by every customer inside the store."" The incident captured by the security cameras happened at a pharmacy in Brazil, not a convenience store in Texas, and the individuals in the video who pulled their guns on the 17-year-old robber were plainclothes military police officers.  It is unknown how many officers shot the boy who attempted to rob the pharmacy",False,"April 5, 2021"
Says Sen. Cory Booker wants to require a federal license for gun owners but criticizes voter ID laws as discriminatory.,"Critics and proponents of stricter gun legislation have sought to bolster their arguments with comparisons to restrictions on voting rights.  In one recent example, Sen. Cory Booker, a New Jersey Democrat who ran for president in 2020, was painted as a hypocrite for advocating an ID requirement for buying a gun, but opposing such a requirement for voting. ""We must have a federal license and I.D. for gun owners!"" reads the text of a viral image on Facebook, over an image of Booker giving a speech. The text over a second image of Booker reads: ""Voter I.D. laws are racist and discriminatory!""    The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) There is no evidence that Booker said the exact quotes from the post. But PolitiFact examined the underlying claim about Booker’s policies on IDs for gun owners and voters, looking at news stories and social media posts about policies he has proposed or endorsed. We found that he has both endorsed licensing for gun buyers and opposed restrictive voter ID laws as discriminatory. A spokesperson for Booker’s office said the post makes an inappropriate comparison. ""This meme wrongly conflates ballots with bullets,"" the spokesperson said. ""The fact is that we urgently need common-sense measures to stem the scourge of gun violence, and we also need to protect every eligible American’s sacrosanct right to vote against unwarranted efforts to impose new barriers based on widely discredited claims about voter fraud."" Booker made national headlines when his short-lived presidential campaign released a plan for a federal gun licensing program as part of a proposal to reduce gun violence. The proposal also included banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, limiting purchases of firearms to one per month and requiring universal background checks.  Booker summarized his federal license policy proposal this way: ""If you need a license to drive a car, you should need a license to own and operate a gun."" Under Booker’s plan, the FBI would administer the licenses, and people would apply for one at designated locations like the ones used for passports, according to a Vox explainer. Applicants would be required to pay a fee, sit through an interview, pass a background check, attend gun safety training and submit paperwork that included a photo and fingerprints.   After announcing the license plan in May 2019, Booker introduced legislation a few months later — titled the Federal Firearm Licensing Act — to make the proposal a reality. The bill was referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee but did not advance further. For years, Booker has publicly criticized restrictive voter ID laws, saying they are not justified by the small risk of fraud. While PolitiFact didn’t find evidence that Booker called voter ID laws ""racist"" as the Facebook post claims, he has publicly criticized voter ID laws as discriminatory and said they unfairly target minorities. During the 2020 campaign, Booker tweeted:  ""Voting rights are still under assault. We’ve watched as: —Voters were purged from rolls
—Voter ID laws targeted people of color
—Elections were stolen We need policy to preserve our right to vote. And it’s a shame we’re still fighting the same struggle of past generations.""  Voting rights are still under assault.

Cory Booker has called for a federal license and ID for gun owners, but opposed voter ID laws.  There’s no evidence Booker used the exact words in the claim, but in broad strokes, the claim accurately represents his positions.

"“Less than 500 people a year killed by all rifles combined” and “4,000 a year killed by illegals.”","The day after the Boulder, Colo., shooting that killed 10 people, President Joe Biden called on Congress to enact legislation to revive a ban on assault rifles and high-capacity ammunition magazines.  A Facebook post suggests the administration is overreacting to gun killings, while being too lax with its border control policies. ""Less than 500 people a year killed by all rifles combined. Let’s ban them,"" the post said, above a picture of an assault-style gun. ""4000 a year killed by illegals. Let’s give them assistance and register them to vote and keep the border WIDE OPEN.""  The claim, originally posted in March 2019 but widely reshared after the mass shootings in Boulder and a few days earlier in Atlanta, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post wildly exaggerates Biden administration policy on both guns and immigration. Biden’s proposal would ban certain semi-automatic rifles classified as assault weapons — not all rifles. And neither he nor his allies in Congress have proposed keeping the border wide open or allowing immigrants who are in the country illegally to register to vote. But for this fact-check, we’re looking at the accuracy of the numbers the Facebook post cites in arguing for stricter border enforcement over stricter gun control.  Fewer than 500 people were murdered with a rifle in each of the past three years, according to the latest annual FBI statistics available. No national statistics are kept on the number of people killed by people who are in the country illegally. But the available figures indicate the number is far below the 4,000 per year claimed. One estimate puts it at about 300. It’s important to note that this claim compares two different things: killings with a type of weapon vs. killings by a category of people. The FBI’s latest annual figures show there were 10,258 murders committed with guns in 2019, including 364 with rifles. The number for rifles was 297 in 2018 and 403 in 2017. That includes various kinds of long guns, including AR-15-style semi-automatic rifles involved in many deadly mass shootings over the past decade.  We found no evidence to support the claim about 4,000 killings a year by people in the country illegally. There are no national crime statistics that are broken down by immigration status. For a rough estimate of the numbers, we looked at administrative arrests by the Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. These are arrests of people who were either present in the U.S. illegally or had somehow violated the terms of their entry or status in the country. Many such arrests occur after local law enforcement officials do background checks on people they have arrested for crimes, said ICE spokesman Shawn Neudauer. In the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 2020, ICE made a total of 103,603 administrative arrests. It said 90% of those arrests were for immigrants with a history of criminal convictions or pending criminal charges. The criminal histories included 1,837 offenses involving homicide — 1,468 convictions and pending 369 charges. In the previous year, the total was 1,923 — 1,549 convictions and 374 pending charges. But the combined offenses noted in those two years didn’t necessarily involve homicide cases from those years. They were people who had been charged with or convicted of homicide in the United States at some time in the past — ICE data doesn’t indicate when. So the claim of 4,000 homicides a year is not supported by ICE data. Alex Nowrasteh, director of immigration studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, said that in Texas, which does track immigration status in crimes, 42 immigrants in the country illegally were convicted of committing a total of 50 homicides in 2019. If those numbers were representative of the country overall, he estimated, about 294 homicides would have been committed by immigrants in the country illegally in 2019. A widely recirculated Facebook post claimed: ""Less than 500 people a year killed by all rifles combined"" and ""4,000 a year killed by illegals.""  The latest FBI figures show there were 364 murders committed with rifles in 2019.  No national crime statistics are kept on the number of people killed by people who are in the country illegally. One estimate based on Texas data puts the national number at under 300. In fiscal 2020, ICE arrested people on immigration violations whose criminal histories included 1,837 homicide convictions or charges sometime in the past, but its data doesn’t say when the killings or convictions occurred.

Ten people were killed in the shooting, including one police officer. Police arrested Alissa, 21, in connection with the attack, during which he was shot through his right leg. Alissa’s brother, Ali Aliwi Alissa, told CNN that their family emigrated from Syria to the U.S. in 2002, and court records and Alissa’s Facebook page said that he was born in 1999 in Syria, a majority-Muslim country. Ali Aliwi Alissa, told CNN that in high school bullies made fun of Ahmad Al Aliwi Alissa’s name and for being Muslim. The Washington Post reported that Alissa complained about hostility toward refugees and Muslims, writing in sharing a link about the impact of immigration on the U.S. economy: ""Why refugees and immigrants are good for America."" A classmate of Alissa’s in high school in Arvada, about 20 miles southeast of Boulder, told the Denver Post that in high school, Alissa was often concerned about being targeted because of his Muslim faith. Alissa often spoke about his Muslim faith on social media and said he believed he was targeted over Islamophobia and racism, Heavy.com reported.

We rated Mostly False a claim by conservative activist Jack Posobiec that Alissa ""was a Syrian refugee who arrived via Obama-era asylum programs.""

"""Ted Cruz says owning a gun should be as hassle free as owning a car, which as I recall requires a license and registration.""","Days after a Colorado gunman opened fire in a grocery store, social media users accused Sen.

We also queried Cruz’s official Twitter accounts and Politwoops, a project from ProPublica that tracks deleted tweets from Cruz and other politicians.  The unsubstantiated quote appears to have taken off after a Twitter user shared it to their more than 11,000 followers, according to Hoaxy, a social media analysis tool. We reached out to that Twitter user, as well as the person who posted the claim to Facebook, but we did not hear back. One Twitter user who shared the same claim pointed PolitiFact to a 2013 Senate hearing. But Cruz did not make the claim about cars and guns during that hearing, either.

"“In a majority of states, new voters are able to obtain a rifle quicker than they’re able to cast their first ballot.”","Shortly after high-profile mass shootings in Georgia and Colorado, the Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing on gun violence. Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., used an analogy with voting rights to make the case for stricter gun control. ""In a majority of states, new voters are able to obtain a rifle quicker than they’re able to cast their first ballot,"" Padilla said on March 22. ""It seems to me we have our priorities entirely backwards when it comes to this, when we make it easier to buy a gun than we do to cast a ballot."" Some critics disagreed. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, tweeted that Padilla’s statement was ""demonstrably, laughably false."" This is demonstrably, laughably false. Find me the Dem that says “it’s abusive to require a photo ID to buy a gun!”They ALL say that about voting.(Except for the CA gubernatorial recall....) https://t.co/YEVqiIbzTq As support, Padilla’s office referred PolitiFact to statistics from the nonpartisan National Conference of State Legislatures; the pro-gun-control Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence; and an analysis by the Washington Post. When we reviewed these sources, we found Padilla’s assertion to be largely supported by the evidence, though we found some nuances. In his analysis, Philip Bump of the Washington Post compared every state and the District of Columbia on how quickly a resident could secure a rifle and cast a ballot after registration. (Bump noted that policies for purchasing a handgun are different, but Padilla specifically mentioned rifles at the hearing. A rifle is a type of ""long gun,"" which is a firearm with a longer barrel that is meant to be held with both hands.) In 13 states, going through either process is equally fast: In Vermont, for instance, it’s possible to buy a rifle without a waiting period, and you can register to vote on Election Day itself.  Three states — Illinois, Minnesota and Washington — make it faster to cast a ballot after registering than to secure a rifle. (There are some complications in some states, such as rules applying to certain types of rifles but not others, Bump noted.) But the majority of states — 34 states plus D.C. — have a longer wait time to cast a ballot than to obtain a rifle, according to Bump’s analysis. . According to Giffords, some states have waiting periods for firearms generally, including rifles. For instance, in Hawaii, the waiting period is 14 days, while in both California and D.C. it takes 10 days. In Florida, the law is three days or however long it takes to complete a background check, whichever is longer. Only two states have waiting periods specific to rifles — Minnesota at seven days and Washington state at 10 days.  As for voting, registration is mandatory in every state except for North Dakota. However, the last day one can register before casting a ballot — in effect, the ""waiting period"" to vote — varies by state. According to data compiled by the group Vote.org, some states like Alaska and Arkansas require registration 30 days prior to Election Day, while in other states like Colorado you can register on Election Day if you are going to vote in person. The fastest voting procedures are in force in 17 states and D.C., where a resident can register and vote the same day, said Danielle Lang, co-director of voting rights and redistricting for the Campaign Legal Center.  ""So there is essentially a waiting period for voting in all other states,"" she said. ""You have to plan to vote ahead of time and can’t do it on a whim the day of."" The bottom line, then, is that about two-thirds of states have a faster process for obtaining a gun than for being able to vote. That’s a ""majority,"" as Padilla said. While Padilla is right on the numbers, the elements of his comparison — guns and voting — are not entirely parallel.  Bump noted in his article that voting ""necessarily involves the state, while a gun purchase doesn’t. One can buy a rifle from a friend, for example; you can’t vote with a friend. That by itself tends to lower the benchmarks required"" for clearing a new gun owner. In addition, election bookkeeping is focused on the smooth functioning of a specific event on a specific date, said Edward B. Foley, an Ohio State University law professor who specializes in election law. The purchase of a gun isn’t. ""Once a background check has been done on a potential gun owner, is there any reason for the government to keep track of the gun owner’s identity?"" he said. ""A gun ownership ‘registry’ would be different than a background check."" Padilla said, ""In a majority of states, new voters are able to obtain a rifle quicker than they’re able to cast their first ballot."" By the numbers, this is accurate: About two-thirds of states have a faster timetable for obtaining a gun than for casting a ballot after registration. Obtaining a gun and casting a ballot aren’t exactly parallel activities. An election is an event on a specific day that requires some degree of advance bookkeeping by state officials to be prepared.

"""In 2004, George W. Bush lifted the ban on those (AR-15 type) rifles, and since then, the number of massacres has increased 183%. During the ban, there were 12 incidents. Since he lifted the ban, there were 34 incidents.""","After a Colorado gunman killed 10 people in what was the second mass shooting in a week, Democrats and gun control advocates renewed calls for a nationwide ban on assault weapons, like the federal law that was in effect from 1994 until 2004. Joy Behar, co-host of ABC’s ""The View,"" joined the chorus March 23. ""In 2004, George W. Bush lifted the ban on those rifles, and since then, the number of massacres has increased 183%,"" Behar said, after rattling off a list of high-profile mass shootings from recent years where the perpetrators used AR-15 style weapons. ""During the ban, there were 12 incidents,"" Behar continued. ""Since he lifted the ban, there were 34 incidents. Anybody, or a right-minded person, can see that that gun has to go."" PolitiFact has fact-checked similar claims assessing the impact of the 1994 assault-weapons ban several times following other mass shootings. We wondered if Behar’s statement was true. The first part of her statement was not. The 1994 ban enacted under former President Bill Clinton expired because of a sunset provision written into the law, not because Bush decided to axe it, as Behar claimed. News reports from the time said he was on board with renewing it. But on the second part, we found that Behar’s numbers aligned with at least one researcher’s findings on mass shootings during and after the ban. And experts who study mass shootings said her broader point — that the number of high-fatality incidents has increased since the ban went away — is largely accurate, although proving cause-and-effect is difficult. The 1994 law, part of an anticrime package authored by then-Sen. Joe Biden, banned the ""manufacture, transfer and possession"" of certain semiautomatic firearms classified as ""assault weapons"" as well as certain high-capacity ammunition magazines of more than 10 rounds.  Clinton signed the law, and Bush was in office when it expired. But Bush didn’t scrap the law.  ""It had a sunset provision and would end after 10 years without renewal or reinstatement,"" said Adam Lankford, a professor of criminology and criminal justice at the University of Alabama. News accounts from the time indicated that as Congress considered extending the ban beyond 2004, Bush said he would support doing so. ""There were attempts by members of Congress to reauthorize it, including Dianne Feinstein, and they all failed,"" said Jaclyn Schildkraut, associate professor of criminal justice at the State University of New York at Oswego. ""But it was not George Bush who lifted it."" There’s no universally accepted definition for mass shootings or ""massacres,"" as Behar described the incidents in question. Asked where Behar got her numbers, an ABC spokesperson pointed to a 2018 report in the Washington Post. The report documented the findings that Louis Klarevas, research professor at Teachers College, Columbia University, outlined in his 2016 book, ""Rampage Nation."" Klarevas examined incidents over three decades — before, during and after the 1994 ban — in which six or more people were shot and killed, not including the perpetrators.  His findings shook out this way: The decade before the ban, 1984-94: 19 incidents. The decade during the ban, 1994-04: 12 incidents. The decade after the ban sunset, 2004-14: 34 incidents. That shows a 183% increase from the decade during the ban to the decade after it ended. Klarevas told PolitiFact that Behar’s claim was largely accurate, save for the blame she wrongly heaped on Bush — and one other caveat. The research Behar cited ""does not account for all high-fatality mass shootings since the federal ban expired,"" Klarevas said. It accounts for only the first 10 years after the ban. ""Behar actually understated the raw numbers, because she said 34 incidents ‘since’ the ban was ended,"" Lankford said. Klarevas said that since the ban expired, he has counted 62 incidents in which six or more people were shot and killed, including the recent shootings in Atlanta and Boulder, Colo.  ""To put this in perspective, during the decade of the federal assault weapons ban, there were 12 high-fatality mass shootings. That comes out to an average of 1.2 incidents per year,"" Klarevas said. ""In the 16.5 years since the expiration of the federal ban, there have been 62 high-fatality mass shootings. That comes out to an average of 3.8 incidents per year."" Between the ban’s expiration and the end of 2019, 32% of high-fatality mass shootings Klarevas recorded involved firearms classified as assault weapons, and 82% involved large-capacity magazines, he said. Other research backs Behar’s broader point that mass shootings have gone up since the ban ended. Not all mass shootings are carried out with the style of weapons that were banned.  Schildkraut’s research follows a different definition of mass shootings that counts targeted, public shootings in which ""multiple"" victims are injured or killed within 24 hours. By her definition, which doesn’t count shootings related to gang violence or terroristic activity, there were 13 mass shootings involving an assault weapon during the ban, and 27 in the decade after. ""We used a different definition of public mass shootings, but our numbers are similar,"" she said.  Grant Duwe, director of research and evaluation for the Minnesota Department of Corrections, who defines mass shootings as incidents where four or more victims are publicly killed, told the Washington Post that his numbers show ""there has been an increase in both the incidence and severity of mass public shootings (on a per capita basis) since the latter part of the 2000s."" Other recent research came from Christopher Koper, a George Mason University professor who wrote a 2004 Justice Department study that gave fuel to both sides of the gun control debate.  In a 2020 report, Koper said the ban on assault weapons and large-capacity magazines ""had exemptions and loopholes that limited its short-term effects, but its expiration in 2004 was followed by an increase in the use of these weapons in mass shootings and other crimes."" Research Lankford co-authored found that attackers’ increased use of semi-automatic rifles and assault weapons is part of the reason why the U.S. has had more high-fatality shootings over time. Another reason appears to be ""a change in motives"" that has more recent mass shooters seeking to kill large numbers of people for fame and attention, Lankford said.  In previous fact-checks, experts cautioned that it's difficult to directly tie increases in mass shootings to the expiration of the 2004 ban.  Klarevas, for his part, argued that the data are strong enough to suggest a causal relationship. A 2019 study that he co-authored, which focused on large-capacity magazines, ""suggested that bans on large-capacity magazines were effective at reducing mass shooting violence,"" he said. Behar said, ""In 2004, George W. Bush lifted the ban on those (AR-15 type) rifles, and since then, the number of massacres has increased 183%. During the ban, there were 12 incidents. Since he lifted the ban, there were 34 incidents."" The ban expired because of a sunset provision in the law, not because of Bush.  The numbers in Behar’s claim aligned with — and even understated — one researcher’s findings on the number of mass shootings that occurred during and after the 1994-to-2004 ban. Other research has similarly identified increases in such incidents since the ban ended, though the exact numbers vary partly due to how ""mass shooting"" is defined",Half True,"March 25, 2021"
These 11 mass shootings involved an AR-15-style weapon.,"Semi-automatic rifles in the AR-15 style have been the weapon of choice in numerous deadly mass shootings. Until 2004, they were banned as assault weapons under federal law. Gun control advocates have focused on firearms of this sort for decades. In the arrest warrant for the gunman in the March 22 shooting that killed 10 people in a Boulder, Colo., supermarket, police describe one of the weapons as ""a rifle (possible AR-15)."" Adam Best, an entrepreneur and progressive activist with over 189,000 followers on Twitter, posted a list with 11 other shootings over the past decade that he said involved an AR-15. Boulder: AR-15Orlando: AR-15Parkland: AR-15Las Vegas: AR-15Aurora, CO: AR-15Sandy Hook: AR-15Waffle House: AR-15San Bernardino: AR-15Midland/Odessa: AR-15Poway synagogue: AR-15Sutherland Springs: AR-15Tree of Life Synagogue: AR-15 AR-15 once referred to a specific model of rifle, but the label has come to be recognized in recent decades as a shorthand term for a category of firearms that share certain characteristics. (The AR stands for ArmaLite, the original maker of the AR-15 rifle.) They are semi-automatic, which means the trigger must be pulled to fire each round, and a new round moves into the chamber after each pull. As rifles, they have a general shape and configuration, and can be customized with a choice of grips, triggers, stock, and more. We reviewed news and law enforcement reports on the shootings listed in Best’s tweet.  We verified that all but one did involve at least one weapon in the AR-15 style. The possible exception was the deadly attack on the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla. Orlando June 12, 2016: A gunman began shooting inside the Pulse, killing 49 people and wounding 53. Orlando Police officers shot and killed him after a three-hour standoff. One of the weapons was a SIG Sauer MCX. The SIG Sauer takes a lot of the form and functions of the AR-15 but with reworked internal mechanics and some other changes. For example, the SIG Sauer is built to handle a different caliber round than the standard AR-15. The two weapons have so much in common that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms called the SIG Sauer used in Orlando a "".223 caliber AR type rifle.""  Guns traced in #Orlando shooting: .223 caliber AR type rifle and 9mm semiautomatic pistol.

""The timing of this is very coincidental, to say the least."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) In 2018, the city of Boulder enacted a ban on the possession, transfer or sale of assault-style weapons and large-capacity magazines. On March 12, more than a week before the shooting, Boulder County District Court Judge Andrew Hartman ruled that the city can’t enforce the ban due to a 2003 state law that says local governments can’t prohibit the possession or sale of firearms, the Post reported. The city has not announced if it will appeal Hartman’s ruling, and the case has yet to reach the Colorado Supreme Court. If it does, ""justices there could for the first time issue a statewide ruling on whether local governments can pass more restrictive gun laws,"" the Post said.  In 2006, the state Supreme Court allowed an assault weapons ban in Denver to stand in part because the city’s ban predated the state law by more than a decade, according to the New York Times. But that ruling did not set a binding precedent for future cases because the court was divided 3-3 on whether Denver’s ban was legal. That left in place the lower court’s ruling in the case. Police have not yet identified the exact weapon used in the supermarket shooting but the New York Times reported on March 23 that ""a federal law enforcement official confirmed that the weapon used was some version of an AR-15 rifle."" A police affidavit said the suspect had both a rifle and pistol at the store and that an officer ""observed the suspect with an assault rifle of unknown make and brand who was shooting toward him."" It also noted that the suspect purchased a Ruger AR556 pistol on March 16.  Our ruling The post says that a week before a mass shooting in Boulder, the Colorado Supreme Court declared that Boulder’s AR-15 ban was unconstitutional. The post is partially accurate but got some important details wrong. A little more than a week ago, a district court judge ruled that the city’s ban on assault-style weapons wasn’t legal under a 2003 state law, not the U.S. or Colorado constitution.  The Colorado Supreme Court has yet to consider the case, and the city hasn’t announced if it will appeal the decision",Half True,"March 23, 2021"
The Atlanta shooting suspect wrote an anti-China post on Facebook prior to the shootings.,"Questions are swirling about Robert Aaron Long, the white gunman charged with killing eight people at three Atlanta area spas on March 16.

A screenshot of the post displays Long’s name and reads:  ""China is engaged in a COVID coverup. They blocked our investigators from going to their lab in Wuhan and finding the truth about the experiments they were conducting there. If they're innocent, why block? China must be hiding something.

I’m here to tell you today that this is not true. The Anti-Gun Lobby has been making this lie up for years."" The post is from Colion Noir, a gun rights advocate who has 1.41 million Facebook followers. It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Thompson, the California Democrat who sponsored H.R. 8, has said it would require background checks for all gun sales and that ""we have 90% of the American people on our side."" The last time national polls were widely done on background checks was in 2019, when the House passed a similar bill. When Americans were asked if they support universal background checks, support was at or near 90%. We found only one national poll since 2019. It was taken online a few days before the House vote and showed 84% support.  H.R. 8 is the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2021. It would prohibit gun transfers between private parties unless a licensed gun dealer, manufacturer, or importer first takes possession of the firearm to conduct a background check. There would be some exceptions, such as gifts between immediate-family members.  ""Nothing in this Act, or any amendment made by this Act, shall be construed to authorize the establishment, directly or indirectly, of a national firearms registry,"" the bill says. The House passed the bill 227-203 on March 11 and sent it to the Senate. Rep. Jared Golden of Maine was the only Democrat to vote no; eight Republicans, including three from Florida, voted yes.  Colion Noir is an alias used by Texas lawyer Collins Iyare Idehen Jr. As a host on the National Rifle Association’s TV channel, he criticized students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., as being un-American when they led a protest march in Washington after a former student shot and killed 17 people at their school in 2018.  Noir argues in his post that a national gun registry would have to be established in order to enforce universal background checks, and that support for universal checks would not be 90% if a registry were required. But neither his post nor an accompanying video provides evidence to back up his claim. He did not reply to our email.  Gun sellers in all 50 states who are federal firearms licensees already use the National Instant Criminal Background Check System to verify that a gun buyer does not have a criminal record or is not otherwise ineligible to purchase or own a firearm. Universal checks would extend that to all gun purchases. The most recent poll that we found was conducted March 6-8, just before the House vote, by Morning Consult/Politico. Registered voters polled online were asked: ""To what extent do you support or oppose the following — requiring background checks for all gun purchasers?"" Those who said they strongly or somewhat support such a measure totaled 84%.  The pollsters asked a similar question in August 2019, and found 90% support. Other polls from 2019 found support for background checks in a similar range, from 83% to 93%, even with some variety in the phrasing of the question; in some cases, it mentioned Congress, pending legislation or the goal of reducing gun violence. Here’s a rundown: NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist   Dec. 9-11: ""Do you think each of the following is a good idea or a bad idea — background checks for gun purchases at gun shows or other private sales?"" Good idea: 87% (compared with 89% in July). Sept. 5-8: ""Do you think Congress should or should not pass legislation to require background checks for gun purchases at gun shows or other private sales?"" Should pass: 83%.  February: ""In order to reduce gun violence, do you think requiring background checks for gun purchases at gun shows or other private sales will make a difference or not make a difference?"" Make a difference: 82%. Washington Post-ABC News Sept. 2-5: ""Would you support or oppose requiring background checks on all potential gun buyers, including private sales and gun shows?""

Pew Research Center Sept. 3-15: ""Please indicate whether you would favor or oppose the following proposals about gun policy — making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks."" Favor: 87%. Quinnipiac University Aug. 21-26: ""Do you support or oppose requiring background checks for all gun buyers?"" Support: 93% (92% to 94% in three other polls between January and May.) September: ""As you may know, the U.S. House of Representatives has passed a bill that would require background checks on all gun sales, including those at gun shows and through online retailers. Do you support or oppose this bill?"" Support: 83% (down from 86% in March). Suffolk University/USA Today Aug. 20-25: ""Do you support requiring background checks for all firearm sales?"" Support: 90%. Monmouth University Aug. 16-20: ""Do you support or oppose requiring comprehensive background checks for all gun purchasers, including private sales between two individuals?"" Support: 83%. NBC News/Wall Street Journal Aug. 10-14: ""I'm going to read you some actions that Congress might take related to guns. Would you strongly support, somewhat support, somewhat oppose, or strongly oppose expanding background checks to all firearm sales and transfers?"" Strongly or somewhat support: 89%.

Associated Press-National Opinion Research Center March 14-18: ""Do you favor, oppose, or neither favor nor oppose ... a federal law requiring background checks on all potential gun buyers, including private sales and gun shows?"" Favor: 83%.  Marquette Law School Poll director Charles Franklin said he hasn’t polled recently on background checks because his focus has been on the coronavirus pandemic and the 2020 election, and that’s likely true for other pollsters.  Kathleen Weldon, director of data operations and communications at the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research at Cornell University, said she was not surprised there hasn’t been much recent polling on background checks, because gun control has not been in the news.  ""I wouldn’t put too much weight on any single polling result,"" Weldon said of Morning Consult’s March 2021 poll. ""To be convinced there was any sort of meaningful drop in support in something where support has been in the high-80s or low-90s for a couple decades, I would definitely want to see more than one example.""

The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.18 percentage points.  The poll, conducted for the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, showed that 89 percent of Democrats and 83 percent of Republicans in Iowa favor background checks. But, the report does not state how many Republicans or Democrats were polled or the margins of errors for each of those groups.  One of the survey’s questions was: ""Do you support or oppose requiring a background check on all gun buyers?"" 86 percent of respondents said support, 7 percent said oppose, and 8 percent said unsure, according to the Giffords report on the poll. The goal of Wessel-Kroeschell and other Democrats has been to show bipartisan support for some gun control measures, like background checks, as Iowans consider the proposed strict scrutiny constitutional amendment that could overturn them. More than one survey exists on the topic. In September 2020 Giffords commissioned a Public Policy Polling Iowa Survey, which found 79 percent of 1,151 Iowa voters — 91 percent of Democrats, 70 Percent of Republicans, and 77 percent of Independent voters,  said they supported background checks for all gun sales. That poll’s margin of error plus or minus 2.9 percentage points. According to a 2019 SurveyUSA poll commissioned by gun-control advocacy group EveryTown for Gun Safety Action Fund, 92 percent of Iowa gun owners, ""support the state’s background check requirement for all handgun sales,"" with a majority of both Democrats and Republicans supporting background check laws. The poll was conducted among 1,239 registered Iowa voters and had a margin of error of plus or minus 2.9 percentage points. Iowa’s margin of supporters for universal background checks on gun owners was comparable to results from nationwide polls on similar questions. In August 2019, NBC News and the Wall Street Journal asked 500 adults if they supported, ""expanding background checks to all firearm sales and transfers."" In that survey, 75 percent said they strongly supported it and 14 percent said they somewhat supported it. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points for 1,000 interviews among adults, and 3.39 percentage points for 834 interviews among registered voters. In September 2019, National Public Radio (NPR), PBS Newshour, and Maris College asked 1,317 people in a nationwide poll if they thought Congress should pass legislation that requires background checks for gun purchases at gun shows or other private sales. Of those answering, 83 percent said yes, 14 percent said no and 3 percent said they were unsure. That poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. A 2019 Pew Research Center Poll showed that Democrats more strongly favored gun control reform, but data showed a majority of Republicans also favor tighter restrictions like background checks. In September 2019, the center partnered with the American Trends Panel to survey 9,895 U.S. adults and found that 93 percent of Democrats and 82 percent of Republicans said they favored, ""making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks.""

The Colorado-based advocacy group has more than 4 million followers on Facebook.  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Rubio’s bill would give grants to states to adopt and implement what are known as extreme-risk protection-order laws, or ""red flag"" laws. Under the bill, a court could order the immediate confiscation of a person’s guns on an emergency basis if the person is judged to be a ""significant danger"" to himself or herself, or to others, ""in the near future.""  But the post and the information it links to are misleading. The bill, in fact, spells out a process that calls for sworn testimony and court hearings.  The headline in the image in the Facebook post is: ""STOP ‘red flag’ gun confiscation."" The rest of the post says:  ""‘Red flag’ gun confiscation bills call for legally owned firearms to be forcibly confiscated from law-abiding Americans without due process, based on unsubstantiated accusations from disgruntled family members, neighbors, co-workers, and/or current or ex-romantic partners, or roommates. In other words: Gun confiscation without due process. Sign the petition to stop S.292!"" It links to a petition that claims the bill ""would use YOUR tax dollars to fund grants to bribe states into passing ‘Red Flag’ Gun Confiscation."" The group and Rubio’s office did not reply to our request for additional comment. This is Rubio’s second time proposing a red flag bill. The first was a month after the Feb. 14, 2018, shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., in which a 19-year-old former student with a semi-automatic rifle killed 17 people and injured 14 more. News stories reported that there had been warning signs about the shooter, including calls about him to 911 and the FBI, threatening statements he allegedly made and the fact he had a gun. The original bill did not come up for a vote.  Rubio introduced a new version on Feb. 8, 2021. S.292, the Extreme Risk Protection Order and Violence Prevention Act, is cosponsored by Sens. Rick Scott, R-Fla.; Jack Reed, D-R.I.; and Angus King, I-Maine. The bill was referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee, but no other action has been taken. Florida is among states that already have red flag laws; it took effect in March 2018. Due process broadly refers to the formal proceedings and rules that ensure that the law is administered fairly and reasonably.  Under due process requirements of a criminal case, for example, a person must be given notice of the charges, be allowed to present evidence on their own behalf and receive a decision from a neutral decision maker.  The due process requirements in a given case can vary, though, based on the circumstances or type of proceeding.  To get an extreme-risk protection order under the Rubio bill, a law enforcement officer, family member or household member would have to petition a court with a sworn affidavit stating why the person ""poses a significant danger of causing personal injury to himself or herself or others"" by possessing a gun.  The petitioner can be someone who has a child in common with the person, a current or former dating partner, or someone who lived with the person in the past year. An initial hearing would be held the same day or on the next business day to consider the evidence. The bill says a court could consider evidence such as:  A threat or act of violence by the respondent in the past 12 months; Evidence of a serious mental illness; Past convictions for violent crimes; Threats or use of weapons against himself or herself or others; Recurring use or threat of use of physical force or stalking another person; Corroborated evidence of drug or alcohol abuse; Other relevant information from family or household members; or, Sworn witness testimony. If the court finds ""clear and convincing evidence"" of significant danger ""in the near future,"" it can order that the guns be temporarily confiscated.  The person with the gun does not have a right to be present for the hearing, or even notified of it, said David Kopel, an adjunct law professor at the University of Denver and an adjunct scholar at the Cato Institute.  However, the court must schedule another hearing within 14 days to determine whether the order should be extended, for up to 12 months. The respondent has the right to participate in that hearing. The National Association for Gun Rights stated that ""Rubio's 'red flag' gun confiscation bill"" calls for guns to be confiscated ""without due process, based on unsubstantiated accusations."" The bill would provide grants to states to enact and implement red flag laws that would allow for courts to order the temporary confiscation of guns from people judged to be a danger to themselves or others because of their gun possession.  In an emergency, based on clear and convincing evidence, a court can order the temporary confiscation of a gun without the person possessing the gun attending a court hearing.  But the bill spells out due process requirements, including sworn testimony and evidence to be presented at the initial hearing, as well as another hearing that’s open to the respondent to determine if a confiscation order should be extended",Mostly False,"March 4, 2021"
Says Jan. 6 Capitol riot “didn’t seem like an armed insurrection.”,"Five people died Jan. 6, 2021, including a U.S. Capitol Police officer, when a mob violently invaded the U.S. Capitol in protest of the November 2020 election results. Few arrests were made that day, but our understanding of the day’s events and the rioters’ motivations has grown over time, as more than 230 people have now been identified and charged, according to a database maintained by National Public Radio. But U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisconsin, still claims accounts of the day’s events are being exaggerated. He made his case Feb. 15, 2021, in an appearance on ""The Jay Weber Show"" on WISN radio. ""The fact of the matter is this didn’t seem like an armed insurrection to me. I mean armed, when you hear armed, don’t you think of firearms?"" Johnson said. ""Here’s the questions I would have liked to ask. How many firearms were confiscated? How many shots were fired? I’m only aware of one, and I’ll defend that law enforcement officer for taking that shot."" Johnson made a nearly identical claim later that morning on another Wisconsin radio show. Johnson is couching this as an opinion, but he’s attempting to make a factual case that Jan. 6 wasn’t an ""armed insurrection.""  So let’s review the evidence on that point. Johnson prefaced this comment by claiming that Democrats are painting a picture of every Trump voter being a violent rioter. Certainly not everyone in the crowd was armed. And many clearly came intending only to peacefully protest. But claiming this was not an armed insurrection goes well behind this line of thinking. Many in the crowd attacking the Capitol have said their intent was to stop the vote confirmation and keep Trump in office despite the election results. That’s an insurrection. That leaves us with his objection to the word ""armed."" Yes, carrying a gun would constitute being armed. But the definition of the word is much more broad, referring simply to carrying a weapon. So the question is whether this insurrection involved people carrying weapons. And it certainly did. First off we’ll note that any reports of weapons at the Capitol will greatly understate the quantity that was likely there. Only 75 people were arrested that day, and police weren’t doing any widespread searches that would have identified weapons on others present, NBC News notes. ""The cops weren't searching people,"" Mark Jones, a former agent of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives with 20 years of counterterrorism experience told NBC News in a Jan. 13, 2021, story. ""I'd speculate that there were many, many more firearms that were there that were not uncovered."" But news and official reports are filled with accounts of armed people at the Capitol. Fourteen people tied to the Jan. 6 attack are facing federal charges related to bringing or using dangerous weapons inside the building and two are facing firearms-related charges, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia. NBC News reported that within a week after the attack a dozen guns and thousands of rounds of ammunition had been found on seven people arrested before and after the Capitol riot. Cleveland Grover Meredith, drove to Washington from Colorado with an assault-style Tavor X95 rifle with a telescopic sight, a Glock 9 mm with high-capacity magazines and more than 2,500 rounds of ammunition, including at least 320 rounds of armor-piercing bullets, NBC reported. Reuters said Meredith texted ""War time"" after hearing Vice President Mike Pence would count electoral votes from states Trump lost. In the trunk of Lonnie Coffman’s vehicle, police found an AR-15-style rifle, a shotgun, a crossbow, several machetes, smoke grenades and 11 Molotov cocktails, Reuters reported. Another man, Christopher Alberts of Maryland, was stopped as he left the Capitol grounds after a police officer spotted a loaded handgun on his hip. Many more people armed themselves by more unorthodox means, causing damage and injury. Robert Sanford, 55, of Pennsylvania, was allegedly caught on video throwing a fire extinguisher at a group of police officers. David Blair, 26, was seen hitting officers with a lacrosse stick, NBC said. Others had pepper spray, brass knuckles, a pipe and pocket knives, and one man was carrying a ""stinger whip,"" a tool with blunt and whip-like edges marketed for self-defense and escaping a locked vehicle. One rioter was caught on video beating a police officer with a flagpole bearing an American flag, NBC Washington reported. The New York Times reviewed video that showed people using stolen police shields, sticks and crutches as weapons. And the man photographed with his feet on the desk of U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was carrying a 950,000-volt stun gun walking stick, House impeachment manager Stacey Plaskett revealed Feb. 10. Not to mention pipe bombs were found near the Capitol at Republican and Democratic party headquarters. Johnson’s staff did not immediately return an email seeking evidence or explanation of his claim. Johnson said the Jan. 6 Capitol riot ""didn’t seem like an armed insurrection."" That’s ridiculous revisionist history. Overwhelmed police arrested and had direct contact with only a fraction of the mob that day, but we still can identify accounts of numerous weapons found in and around the Capitol, brought there in some cases by people who saw themselves as soldiers in a war. And many other rioters used whatever hard objects they could find to attack police and force their way into the Capitol. A majority of senators, through the impeachment vote, put the blame on Trump for stirring up the riot, though others debate the ""why"" question for the events of Jan. 6. But the ""what"" question shouldn't be debated. It was an armed insurrection",False Pants on Fire,"February 15, 2021"
"The woman killed during the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol assault was shot by a Secret Service agent, not Capitol Police.","The unprecedented Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol spawned a predictable array of online rhetoric about who was involved and what exactly happened. Many details were still emerging a day later, but we know the mob fueled by and in support of President Donald Trump forced its way into the House and Senate chambers after a series of f violent clashes with law enforcement. When the dust cleared, more than 50 police officers were injured and four people were dead — three from what authorities termed medical emergencies, and one from a gunshot wound. Wisconsin state Rep. Jonathan Brostoff, D-Milwaukee, focused on the woman shot and killed in a Jan. 7 tweet, describing the matter this way: ""The Trump Terrorist who was put down during the violent mob assault wasn’t (as they claimed) shot by the Capitol Police, they were (physically) on her side. Instead it was a secret service agent who discharged his firearm while doing his duty to protect democracy."" The Secret Service claim caught our eye. Let’s take a closer look. After an incendiary speech from Trump the morning of Jan. 6, thousands of his supporters marched to the Capitol. It was a gathering long planned and promoted online by Trump backers and conspiracy theorists. In what experts have called a catastrophic failure of security, the group not only moved through barriers around the building but broke through windows to enter the building itself.  The deadly showdown occurred in a hallway where Capitol Police had used furniture to barricade a glass door. Witness video (warning, graphic content) shows a plain-clothes officer standing with a gun drawn. He fires once as a woman later identified as Ashli Babbitt climbs through a broken window adjoining the door. Babbitt falls to the floor, where she is immediately treated by uniformed officers on her side of the barricade. A Jan. 7 news release by Capitol Police said she was taken to a nearby hospital where she died of her injuries. U.S. Rep. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., told Good Morning America he was in the hallway behind the officer who shot and killed Babbitt. ""When they broke the glass in the back, the (police) lieutenant that was there, him and I already had multiple conversations prior to this, and he didn't have a choice at that time,"" Mullin said in a Jan. 7 interview. ""The mob was going to come through the door, there was a lot of members and staff that were in danger at the time. And when he (drew) his weapon, that's a decision that's very hard for anyone to make and, once you draw your weapon like that, you have to defend yourself with deadly force."" Babbitt, a 35-year-old San Diego woman, was a 14-year Air Force veteran who served four tours as a high-level security official, KUSI-TV in San Diego reported. Her husband told the station she was an avid Trump supporter. Babbitt also backed the violent QAnon conspiracy theory, with 21 tweets referencing that slogan since February 2020, according to the Daily Beast. The site reported that Babbitt posted Jan. 5 that the United States would soon see ""The Storm,"" a day of reckoning the conspiracy theorists believed was coming for deep-state pedophiles, sex traffickers and Trump opponents. Brostoff said his claim was based on watching witness video that showed a non-uniformed officer shooting Babbitt.  But he’s wrong. A statement by Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund said Babbitt was shot by a sworn Capitol Police officer who has been placed on administrative leave in line with agency policy. That’s in line with the description from Mullin, who witnessed the shooting and talked to the officer involved. In light of that information, Brostoff said he ""may well have been misinformed"" and deleted his tweet. Brostoff claimed a Secret Service agent was responsible for the lone shooting death in the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol. But he now acknowledges that was incorrect. Law enforcement confirmed later that day a Capitol Police officer pulled the trigger",False,"January 7, 2021"
"""Kyle Rittenhouse used his COVID-19 stimulus check to purchase the AR-15 he used in the fatal Kenosha shooting.""","Out of jail for the first time since August, Kyle Rittenhouse is garnering a new wave of attention. The 17-year-old from Antioch, Ill., had been held on a $2 million bond on charges he shot three people — killing two — during the Kenosha unrest that followed the police shooting of Jacob Blake. In that time the Illinois teen has become something of a conservative celebrity, generating millions of dollars for his release and the ongoing legal case where his lawyers will argue he acted in self defense. Rittenhouse was released from custody Nov. 20, 2020, but we learned an array of new details the day before in a jailhouse interview with the Washington Post — including how he came by the gun used in the shooting. One widely shared Instagram post honed in on that detail Nov. 20, saying, ""Kyle Rittenhouse used his COVID-19 stimulus check to purchase the AR-15 he used in the fatal Kenosha shooting."" Did the gun used in the streets of Kenosha really come from a federally-funded stimulus? The balleralert Instagram account that posted the claim cited the Washington Post as its source, and that is largely what the paper reported. The Nov. 19 story reads in part, ""The Post found that Rittenhouse, who was too young to buy a rifle, had arranged for an adult friend to buy the weapon for him using money Rittenhouse had received from a government stimulus program."" That friend, 19-year-old Dominick Black of Burlington, Wis., purchased the weapon for him at an Ace Hardware store in Ladysmith, Wis., on May 1, 2020, according to a criminal complaint charging Black with two felony counts of intentionally giving a dangerous weapon to someone under 18, resulting in death. The gun was then stored at Black’s stepfather’s house in Kenosha, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. Here’s how Rittenhouse described the purchase to the Post. ""I got my $1,200 from the coronavirus Illinois unemployment because I was on furlough from YMCA,"" he said. ""And I got my first unemployment check so I was like, ‘Oh, I’ll use this to buy it.’"" This is where the matter gets a bit muddled. The Post reported generally that stimulus funds were used, while the Instagram post made a more specific reference to ""stimulus checks,"" which would reference the payments of $1,200 per person. And Rittenhouse appears to confuse the two in his statement. The stimulus checks approved by Congress in March were indeed for $1,200, but those are different from unemployment. Stimulus payments went to all adults under certain income limits, while unemployment benefits are paid only to those out of work — as Rittenhouse was, based on his furlough description.  Rittenhouse told the Post he lived with his mother, a circumstance that would typically mean she claims him as a dependent on her taxes. That would make him ineligible for the $1,200 stimulus payment. Instead, it appears Rittenhouse was referencing several weeks of unemployment compensation approved through the CARES Act, said Washington Post Investigations Editor Jeff Leen. He said Rittenhouse’s mother later told the paper that money for the gun came from ""special unemployment"" related to the pandemic. Rittenhouse had noted he was off work, and the act signed into law March 27 provided an extra $600 per week in unemployment through the end of July. Rittenhouse’s attorneys did not return a phone call or email seeking clarification. An Instagram post says ""Kyle Rittenhouse used his COVID-19 stimulus check to purchase the AR-15 he used in the fatal Kenosha shooting."" We don’t have bank records or documents to concretely prove this, leaving us to take Rittenhouse at his word on the source of the funds.  Rittenhouse did tell the Post he used $1,200 in coronavirus funds, but he appears to confuse stimulus and unemployment payments.  It’s more likely Rittenhouse was referring to unemployment than the stimulus program itself, based on his life circumstances and description from him and his mother. That is indeed a ""COVID-19 stimulus,"" but not the one people would think of based on this post’s description",Half True,"November 25, 2020"
"Says Joe Biden told a factory worker, “I don’t work for you!” while pointing a finger in the worker’s face.","There’s no question that Joe Biden cursed at a factory worker during a March 10 visit to a Fiat Chrysler assembly plant, calling him ""full of s---"" and telling him not to be a ""horse’s a--.""

Biden was visiting the Detroit plant on the day of the Michigan primary when a factory worker accused him of ""actively trying to diminish our Second Amendment right and take away our guns,"" PolitiFact reported.  Biden replied that he supports the Second Amendment but not assault weapons or high-capacity magazines. The exchange, which took place in a noisy site crowded with workers, turned contentious as the worker repeatedly challenged Biden’s responses, with Biden shouting at times and other workers and aides trying to cut off the exchange.  At one point, according to media reports, the worker said to Biden, ""You’re working for me, man."" Biden’s reply was not uniformly reported by the media, and video footage of the incident does not clearly capture all of the dialogue.   WATCH: ""You’re full of sh*t,"" @JoeBiden tells a man who accused him of ""actively trying to end our Second Amendment right.""""I support the Second Amendment,"" Biden adds while vising under-construction auto plant in Detroit. @CBSNews pic.twitter.com/sueOSBaY9P   Some outlets, including CBS News and The Detroit News, reported that Biden responded, ""I’m not working for you.

Don’t be such a horse’s a--.""  CNN’s report was presented more like a transcript of the exchange, while other media accounts appeared to paraphrase it or edit it down. For example, Biden clearly says ""give me a break"" at the 1-minute mark in the video before saying ""don’t be such a horse’s a--."" Neither the CBS nor Detroit News article included that phrase.  The Facebook post includes a photo of Biden pointing his finger at the worker.

“BREAKING NEWS: All Charges Dropped for Kyle Rittenhouse.”,"Kyle Rittenhouse, the 17-year-old accused of killing two protesters and injuring a third in Kenosha, Wis., has become a cause celebre for gun-rights activists and others. Through online appeals, his lawyers have raised millions for Rittenhouse’s legal defense and released a video that positions him as a patriot who acted in self defense. But have they already won an acquittal on all charges, as a viral Facebook post claims? No. Far, far from it. Rittenhouse faces charges in Wisconsin based on the shootings, which occurred late Aug. 25, 2020 during civil unrest in Kenosha, which began after a Kenosha police officer shot Jacob Blake, 29, in the back, leaving Blake paralyzed. Rittenhouse is currently being held in Lake County, Ill., where he turned himself in to authorities after returning home to Antioch after the incident. Nevertheless, an Oct. 13, 2020, post on Facebook included this blaring headline: ""BREAKING NEWS: All Charges Dropped for Kyle Rittenhouse.""  The post included two images of Rittenhouse from that night, with these words: ""All charges dropped for Kyle Rittenhouse,"" and ""Lake County prosecutors announce they will not file charges against Kyle Rittenhouse.""  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook). We reached out to the Facebook user who posted the claim but did not hear back. But this is an easy one to tackle: The claim all charges have been dropped is simply false. The confusion may stem from an announcement earlier on Oct. 13, 2020, in which prosecutors in Lake County, Ill., said they had found no basis to charge Rittenhouse under Illinois laws.  More specifically, an article posted that day on JSOnline.com, the website of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, noted the Illinois authorities said they had determined the AR-15 rifle in question had been purchased, stored and used in Wisconsin, and that Rittenhouse never possessed it in Illinois. Thus, he would not face gun-related charges there. But Rittenhouse still faces Wisconsin charges of first-degree intentional homicide in the killing of two protesters and attempted intentional homicide in the wounding of a third. He also faces a misdemeanor charge of underage firearm possession.  Those charges are on hold while Rittenhouse’s lawyers fight his extradition to Wisconsin. But they have not been dropped, or otherwise magically gone away. A Facebook post said:  ""All charges dropped for Kyle Rittenhouse.""  That is flatly and plainly wrong. The shootings happened in Wisconsin, not Illinois. The Wisconsin charges remain. Rittenhouse was never charged in Illinois, so when authorities said they found no basis to issue gun-possession charges, it didn’t change anything",False,"October 15, 2020"
Says Tony Evers and Mandela Barnes “have participated in rallies that have done more to incite than calm the situation” in Kenosha,"Wisconsin’s elected officials didn’t hesitate to point fingers at one another after Kenosha police officer Rusten Sheskey shot Jacob Blake, a 29-year-old Black man, seven times at close range on Aug. 23, 2020.  The shooting and the video of it that went viral ignited days of protest and unrest in the city, which reached a breaking point Aug. 26, 2020 when an Illinois teen — who had joined a group of armed people responding to a Facebook call to protect and defend the city — shot and killed two people, according to criminal charges.  Wisconsin Democrats say their counterparts across the aisle haven’t done enough to act on racial disparities and police brutality, criticizing GOP leaders for gaveling out of an Aug. 31, 2020 special session called by Gov. Tony Evers to address such issues in less than 30 seconds.  Republicans, meanwhile, have pointedly blamed Evers, saying the deaths of the two people that Kyle Rittenhouse is accused of shooting could have been avoided if the state had been more aggressive earlier about deploying National Guard troops. Trump appeared in Kenosha on Sept. 1, 2020 to meet with local law enforcement officers and business owners, despite a plea from Evers and other Democratic state leaders to stay away during a painful time for the city.  U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisconsin, welcomed the visit and in an Aug. 31, 2020 statement blasted Evers and Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, saying that instead of working with Trump they ""made statements, leapt to conclusions, and have participated in rallies that have done more to incite than calm the situation.""  Did Evers and Barnes participate in rallies that have ""done more to incite than calm the situation in Kenosha,"" as Johnson claims?  Johnson’s office did not respond to a request for the evidence that he used to make the claim, but his statement echoes an Aug. 25, 2020 claim from state Sen. Howard Marklein, R-Spring Green, that Evers and Barnes did not ""call for peace"" or ""encourage calm"" after Blake was shot.  We rated that claim Mostly False. Evers released a video statement the day prior asking protesters to remain peaceful.  What about the rallies? Besides a joint news conference on Aug. 27, 2020 in Kenosha, Evers and Barnes have not appeared together publicly to discuss the situation.   Evers spokeswoman Britt Cudaback said the pair have gone to one rally between the two of them, an Aug. 29, 2020 event that Blake’s family asked Barnes to attend.  Barnes met with Blake’s family, spoke at the event and marched alongside thousands who showed, Cudaback said.  Reports from the rally confirm it was a peaceful one, but the Republican Party of Wisconsin and the Kenosha News seized on a comment near the end of the event in which an unidentified  man took the microphone, decried police shootings of Black people and said, ""If you kill one of us, it’s time for us to kill one of yours.""  The remarks were met with a muted response from the crowd. To be sure, the comment strayed from the message of the event. In the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel’s reporting, Blake’s father, Jacob Blake Sr., is quoted asking people to be calm and civil, saying, ""If we tear it up, we have nothing.""   Barnes, meanwhile, spoke on the importance of voting and continued activism, commended Blake’s family for their resilience despite ""centuries of injustice"" that Black people have endured and urged the crowd to demand accountability from police departments.  In any case, Johnson’s claim was that the rally did more ""to incite than calm the situation."" But examining the timeline of the last week in the city, the violence and property destruction in Kenosha took place in the days before the Saturday rally — not after.  Protests and cases of arson and looting began the night Blake was shot and reached a chaotic point two nights later, on the night Rittenhouse is charged with killing two and injuring one.  The rally Barnes attended was days later. Indeed, Johnson himself noted during Trump’s visit that the situation in Kenosha became much calmer after the night where the protesters were shot. He credits the president. But in praising Trump for bringing calm, he undermines his claim here that an event days later attended by Barnes somehow incited violence again. In short, it can’t be both. Johnson claimed that Evers and Barnes ""have participated in rallies that have done more to incite than calm the situation"" in Kenosha. Barnes was present at a rally where a threat was made, but the event was overall a peaceful one, and reports of violence tied to Blake’s shooting came before the rally, not after.   And Johnson himself, while praising Trump’s actions, has acknowledged things had been quiet for days before the Barnes speech -- and have remained so in the days since",False,"September 1, 2020"
"Says video shows Kyle Rittenhouse, the 17-year-old charged with killing two protesters in Kenosha, ""was trying to get away from them"" ... ""fell, and then they violently attacked him.""","Editor's note: This item was updated to make clear that we are rating whether Trump described what happened accurately, not the separate question of whether what happened amounted to self-defense or, as charged by local prosecutors, homicide and other offenses. President Donald Trump visited Kenosha on Sept. 1, 2020 as the city reels from the shooting of a Black man by police and the shooting deaths of two protesters during a night of chaos.  Jacob Blake, 29, was shot in the back seven times at close range by Officer Rusten Sheskey on Aug. 23, 2020 as he walked away from officers and tried to get into an SUV with three of his children inside. The shooting left him paralyzed from the waist down, according to his family.  Two nights later, an Illinois teenager used an AR-15-style rifle to kill two protesters and injure a third, according to eyewitness videos and a criminal complaint. The charges against Kyle Rittenhouse, 17, increased tensions in a city that was already on edge, with some condemning his actions and others saying he was protecting the city and only shot in self-defense. In an Aug. 31, 2020 media briefing, on the eve of his visit to Kenosha, Trump defended Rittenhouse’s actions when asked about the teenager.  ""You saw the same tape as I saw,"" Trump said. ""And he was trying to get away from them, I guess; it looks like. And he fell, and then they very violently attacked him. And it was something that we’re looking at right now and it’s under investigation."" He went on to say of Rittenhouse: ""I guess he was in very big trouble. He would have been — I — he probably would have been killed."" The president correctly describes some minor details about that night. But overall, his comments grossly mischaracterize what happened — leaving out that by the time of the events he described, prosecutors say Rittenhouse had already shot and killed a man. In this fact-check, we are not examining the question of whether Rittenhouse acted in self-defense, as his attorney claims. We are examining whether Trump is providing an accurate description of what happened by focusing on only a portion of the events of that night. He is not. Let’s take a look.  Details of the Aug. 25, 2020 shootings have emerged through eyewitness videos and a criminal complaint filed in Kenosha County Circuit Court.  Here’s what we know:  Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, approached Rittenhouse and a reporter interviewing him that night and began to chase Rittenhouse after he did a ""juke"" move. Rosenbaum threw a plastic bag at Rittenhouse, but it didn’t hit him.  The two ended up in a parking lot, and the reporter told authorities that Rosenbaum tried to grab Rittenhouse’s gun. Rittenhouse fired four shots, and Rosenbaum dropped to the ground in front of him. In a video, Rittenhouse can be heard saying on his cell phone, ""I just killed someone."" Rittenhouse began running slowly down the street as a crowd began to follow him, with some people shouting ""get him!"" and shouting he just shot someone. Rittenhouse tripped and fell.  While he was on the ground, police say, he appeared to fire two shots at a man who jumped over him but missed.  After that, Anthony Huber, 26, ran up to Rittenhouse with a skateboard in one hand and appeared to hit him with it before reaching for Rittenhouse’s gun. Rittenhouse fired one round that hit Huber in the chest and killed him. Rittenhouse sat up and pointed his gun at Gaige Grosskreutz, 26, who had started to approach him. Grosskreutz took a step back and put his hands in the air, but then moved toward Rittenhouse, who fired a shot that hit Grosskreutz in the arm. Grosskreutz had a handgun. It is unclear whether Grosskreutz was pointing the gun at Rittenhouse, or if Rittenhouse saw that Grosskreutz had a gun. Trump’s comments completely overlook the fact that people started following him after he allegedly shot and killed someone. He also claimed protesters ""violently attacked"" Rittenhouse, but that is not fully supported by the videos, either. Witnesses say those who were chasing Rittenhouse were trying to stop him. Rittenhouse later walked past a group of police vehicles, hands in the air, and ultimately returned home to nearby Antioch, Illinois, where he was arrested the next day. What’s more, Trump suggested the matter is ""under investigation."" But while Rittenhouse’s attorney has indicated he would argue self defense, the teen has already been charged with homicide. It’s unclear what, if any, investigation would still be open. Even before the comments, Trump drew headlines when he ""liked"" a tweet that said, ""Rittenhouse is a good example of why I decided to vote for Trump."" Rittenhouse, who is in jail awaiting extradition to Kenosha to face charges, is a Trump supporter. Trump said a video shows Rittenhouse ""was trying to get away from"" protesters""  and ""fell, and then they violently attacked him."" Rittenhouse did fall as a crowd followed him, but Trump’s comments leave an incendiary and false picture: By the time he fell, according to criminal charges, Rittenhouse had already shot and killed one person that night",False,"September 1, 2020"
"In contrast to how a Black man who was shot by police was treated, Kenosha police officers ""let an armed white supremacist walk right past them after shooting people.""","A volatile climate in Kenosha turned violent after an Illinois teen allegedly killed two protesters and injured another amid turmoil over the shooting by police of Jacob Blake.  Kyle Rittenhouse, 17, was charged with first-degree intentional homicide and five other crimes on Aug. 27, 2020. He is accused of using an AR-15-style rifle to shoot and kill Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, and Anthony Huber, 26, and injure Gaige Grosskreutz, 26.  The violence came days after Blake, a 29-year-old Black man, was shot in the back seven times at point-blank range by a Kenosha police officer. Blake remains hospitalized and paralyzed from the waist down, according to his family, as protesters renew calls to combat police brutality that disproportionately affects Black people. Rittenhouse’s arrest prompted scrutiny of the teenager’s background and frustration over his treatment by Kenosha police — particularly when compared to Blake’s treatment by officers days prior.  U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore, a Milwaukee Democrat, weighed in with this tweet Aug. 26, 2020:  ""The same police department who shot an unarmed black man 7 times in the back for walking away from them just let an armed white supremacist walk right past them after shooting people."" We previously looked at claims about the shooting of Blake, and whether he was armed, including that he ""declared he had a gun in the car and was going to go get it"" and was ""brandishing"" a knife. We rated that claim False. There was no gun, and while there are varying reports of whether he had a knife in his hand or it was found on the floorboard of the car he was entering, he was not ""brandishing"" it at police on the scene. So we will focus here on Moore’s characterization of how authorities in Kenosha treated Rittenhouse in the moments after the shooting. Let’s take a look at her account. When asked for evidence to support Moore’s claim, her office pointed to four news articles about the Aug. 25, 2020 incident that led to Rittenhouse’s arrest. Here’s what we know: According to eyewitness videos and the criminal complaint, Rittenhouse shot and killed Rosenbaum in a parking lot after Rosenbaum chased him and tried to grab his gun.  Rittenhouse then began running slowly down the street, but tripped and fell as a crowd began to follow him. While he was on the ground, Huber approached him with a skateboard in one hand and reached for Rittenhouse’s gun with the other. Rittenhouse fired one round that hit Huber in the chest and killed him. Rittenhouse sat up and pointed his gun at Grosskreutz, who took a step back but then moved toward Rittenhouse. He fired a shot that hit Grosskreutz in the arm. Afterward, video footage showed Rittenhouse approaching police vehicles with his hands raised. Several vehicles passed him after he waved toward the first. A voice can be heard yelling, ""Hey, he just shot them! Hey, dude right here just shot them!"" Another voice on a police loudspeaker is heard saying, ""Someone injured, straight ahead."" Rittenhouse ultimately returned to his hometown of nearby Antioch, Illinois, where he was later arrested. Kenosha Police Chief Daniel Miskinis defended his department’s actions in an Aug. 28, 2020 news conference, saying the police in the vehicles didn’t see Rittenhouse as a threat and wouldn’t have heard yelling from the crowd over other noise. He said officers were more focused on the injuries and what happened down the street. So, multiple sources — including the Kenosha Police Department — have verified that Rittenhouse walked by police after the shootings. Moore is on target with that part of the claim. Merriam-Webster defines a white supremacist as someone who ""believes that the white race is inherently superior to other races and that white people should have control over people of other races."" Video taken before the shootings showed Rittenhouse with a group of armed, older men linked to a local group called the Kenosha Guard. Leaders of the group, which that afternoon put out a call for people to bring weapons to defend Kenosha businesses, say Rittenhouse is not a member. But according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Rittenhouse identifies with such groups. ""People are getting injured and our job is to protect this business,"" Rittenhouse said in a video interview that night with The Daily Caller. ""And my job also is to protect people. If someone is hurt, I’m running into harm’s way. That’s why I have my rifle; I’ve gotta protect myself, obviously. But I also have my med kit."" Before it was taken down, Rittenhouse’s Facebook page showed several pro-police photos, including one that featured the phrase, ""Blue lives matter.""  Three of the four news reports cited by Moore’s office do not reference white supremacy or extremism. And the only one that does, an Aug. 27, 2020 article from CBS News, cites the Anti-Defamation League as saying Rittenhouse does not appear to be involved with any extremist movements. Oren Segal, vice president of the Anti-Defamation League’s Center on Extremism, echoed that in an interview with PolitiFact Wisconsin. Based on a review of Rittenhouse’s TikTok, Facebook and Instagram accounts, Segal said, the organization has not found evidence linking Rittenhouse to white supremacist groups. Segal noted that Rittenhouse appears to embrace the Blue Lives Matter movement, which backs police officers and was created in the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement. Segal said Blue Lives Matter is supported by some extremist groups, but also by many other people.  He contends misidentifying someone as a white supremacist can amount to ""crying wolf"" and minimize the seriousness of extremist beliefs and behaviors. ""We need to really be sober about what we are seeing, and we need to tackle it with some honesty and not just fall prey to inaccurate, perhaps politically expedient categorizations,"" Segal said.  In a tweet, Moore said in contrast to how a Black man who was shot by police was treated, Kenosha police officers ""let an armed white supremacist walk right past them after shooting people."" Kenosha police did let Rittenhouse walk by and ultimately return home to Illinois after prosecutors say he killed two protesters and injured a third.  But social media posts and profiles haven’t revealed any evidence linking him to white supremacist groups, according to a key organization that tracks extremist activity",Half True,"September 1, 2020"
"Says a photo shows accused shooter Kyle Rittenhouse’s mother, armed with a long gun, in Kenosha, Wisconsin, on the night two protesters were killed and one injured.","Nearly a week after 17-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse arrived in Kenosha from Antioch, Illinois, and — according to criminal charges — shot and killed two people during a night of protests and chaos in the city, a photo is circulating on social media purporting to describe how he got there.  Rittenhouse was recorded on video that night carrying a rifle and saying it was his job to protect life and property. It was the third night of unrest after a Kenosha police officer shot Jacob Blake, a 29-year-old Black man, seven times in the back at close range. Rittenhouse has been charged with homicide and remains in Illinois awaiting further legal proceedings. On Aug. 28, 2020, Facebook user Doug McLean shared a photo and connected it to the night of the deadly shooting. It has since drawn more than 800 shares and, in its various iterations, scores of comments.  In the picture, a white woman is shown wearing fatigues with a long gun strapped to her chest. ""How did Kyle Rittenhouse cross state lines to Wisconsin? His mom, pictured below drove him. #KyleRittenhouse’s mom Wendy, photographed on same night her son killed two people and shot another,"" McLean wrote.  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) A release from Rittenhouse’s attorneys on Aug. 28, 2020 disputes this. That release says Rittenhouse had stayed in Kenosha for the night after finishing work as a community lifeguard. But there’s a bigger problem with the photo that was shared: It’s not even from the same day. Or the same city. Let’s dig in.  The woman with the long gun actually appears in a photo in a separate city, on a different day. The image was cropped in the Facebook post in question to focus on her. Facebook user Miki Pope shared the original photo, in which the woman stands with a group of other similarly armed people outside the Wisconsin state Capitol in Madison, where protests also occurred after Blake was shot by police.  ""Last night (Aug 24) in Madison, these counter-protesters showed up with long guns,"" Pope wrote in the early morning hours of Aug. 26, 2020.  Pope’s post references the violence Rittenhouse is charged with in Kenosha, but does not in any way tie him to the people in the photo aside from decrying the actions of such militia members that have been showing up at various protests.  ""I'm afraid this won't be the last shooting, as armed white supremacists are becoming more and more public about their hatred for Black lives and the Black Lives Matter protests,"" Pope wrote.  It’s unknown whether Rittenhouse’s mother had any involvement in bringing her son to Kenosha that day — but the photo does not depict anyone who was there.  And, as noted, Rittenhouse’s attorney says the teen was in Kenosha already and stayed there into the night hours. A Facebook user claimed that a photo of a white woman with a gun was the mother of Kyle Rittenhouse.  But the photo is not from that protest. It’s cropped from a larger image of a handful of people with guns standing outside the state capitol in Madison two days earlier",False,"August 31, 2020"
“At 17 years old Kyle (Rittenhouse) was perfectly legal to be able to possess that rifle without parental supervision.”,"EDITOR'S NOTE, Nov. 16, 2021: Judge Bruce Schroeder recently dismissed a misdemeanor charge of possession of a dangerous weapon by a person under 18 against Kyle Rittenhouse. Readers asked us if this made the fact-check below invalid. We don’t think so. Here’s why.  In August 2020, we fact-checked a claim that it was ""perfectly legal"" for Rittenhouse to possess an AR-15 without parental supervision. Our reporting found that it was far from perfectly legal, and that it was, in fact, legally murky. That’s why we rated the claim False. Wisconsin law says that ""any person under 18 years of age who possesses or goes armed with a dangerous weapon is guilty of a Class A misdemeanor."" In our fact-check, we cite the possibility of an exception for rifles and shotguns. The exception is aimed at letting children ages 16 and 17 hunt. But, as it is also clear, Rittenhouse wasn’t in Kenosha to hunt. This same legal debate played out a couple of times during the Rittenhouse trial, according to the Associated Press.  Rittenhouse’s defense asked Schroeder to dismiss the firearm possession charge during a pretrial hearing in October. Schroeder, according to the Associated Press, acknowledged the intent of the statute was murky but decided not to dismiss the charge. The issue came up again on Nov. 15 as lawyers were debating instructions to the jury.  Prosecutors argued that allowing an exception for hunting-style weapons would effectively eliminate the prohibition on minors carrying weapons. But in this instance, Schroeder dismissed the charge, saying he had a ""big problem"" with the state statute. In its reporting, the Associated Press quoted Kenosha defense attorney Michael Cicchini, who is not involved in the case. Cicchini said when statutes aren't clear, they must be read in favor of the defense. ""This is the price the government must pay when it is incapable of drafting clear laws,"" Cicchini wrote in an article. The ruling does appear at odds with the intent of legislators. In 2018, the Wisconsin Legislative Council Staff, a nonpartisan legislative service agency akin to the Congressional Research Service, wrote that, ""Under Wisconsin law, with certain exceptions for hunting, military service, and target practice, a person under age 18 is generally prohibited from possessing or going armed with a firearm."" These subsequent events show the grey areas of local gun laws — hardly a case of something being ""perfectly legal."" Our fact-check remains unchanged. • • • The 17-year-old accused of shooting three people during a protest in Kenosha, Wis., faces several charges, including first-degree intentional homicide. But some widely shared Facebook posts say he should be cleared of at least some of them. In an Aug. 27 post, one Facebook user said it was ""perfectly legal"" for Kyle Rittenhouse — who was arrested in Antioch, Ill., after fleeing Wisconsin — to brandish an assault-style rifle on the streets of Kenosha. ""Carrying a rifle across state lines is perfectly legal,"" the poster said. ""Based on the laws I can find of this area at 17 years old Kyle was perfectly legal to be able to possess that rifle without parental supervision."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) On Aug. 25, two protesters were killed and one injured after police say someone opened fire on them. The violence occurred on the third night of protests over the shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man, by a white police officer in Kenosha. Blake survived, but he is partially paralyzed from a bullet that severed his spinal cord. Rittenhouse stands accused of shooting the protesters. Since his lawyer has said that Rittenhouse obtained the assault-style rifle from a friend in Wisconsin (meaning that he didn’t transport it with him from Illinois), we’re going to focus on the second half of the claim — that it was ""perfectly legal"" for the teenager to carry a firearm in Kenosha.  Is that true? State laws suggest not. The Wisconsin Department of Justice honors concealed carry permits issued in Illinois. But Rittenhouse did not have a permit to begin with, and he was not legally old enough to carry a firearm in Wisconsin. In Illinois, concealed carry applicants must be at least 21 years old. Since Rittenhouse is 17, he would not qualify for a permit. In Wisconsin, it is legal for adults to carry firearms in public without a license if the gun is visible. However, to open carry, you must be at least 18 years old. Wisconsin law stipulates that ""any person under 18 years of age who possesses or goes armed with a dangerous weapon is guilty of a Class A misdemeanor."" On Aug. 27, prosecutors charged Rittenhouse with a misdemeanor count of possession of a dangerous weapon under the age of 18, according to court records. John Monroe, an attorney who specializes in gun rights, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that there’s an exception for rifles and shotguns, which is aimed at letting children ages 16 and 17 hunt, that could apply. But Rittenhouse wasn’t in Kenosha to hunt. The newspaper reported that — based on interviews, videos and social media posts — Rittenhouse considered himself to be a militia member protecting private property. His Facebook page, which has since been taken down, had several posts expressing support for police. ""People are getting injured and our job is to protect this business,"" Rittenhouse told the Daily Caller in a video interview before the shooting. ""And my job also is to protect people. If someone is hurt, I’m running into harm’s way. That’s why I have my rifle; I’ve gotta protect myself, obviously. But I also have my med kit."" We reached out to the person who published the Facebook post for a comment, but we haven’t heard back. Whether Rittenhouse violated Wisconsin law by possessing a firearm underage is the subject of ongoing litigation. But the Facebook post claimed that it was ""perfectly legal"" for the teenager to carry an assault-style rifle in Kenosha. At best, that’s unproven. At worst, it’s inaccurate",False,"August 28, 2020"
"Says Gov. Tony Evers and Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, after police shooting of Jacob Blake, ""did not call for peace. They did not encourage calm.","The national protests over police brutality that started in Minnesota after a Minneapolis police officer killed George Floyd by kneeling for nearly nine minutes on his neck have now focused squarely on Wisconsin. On Sunday August 23, 2020, a Kenosha police officer shot Jacob Blake in the back multiple times at close range as Blake tried to get into a small SUV. Protests re-ignited across the country, including in Madison and, of course, Kenosha, where buildings were vandalized and burned, windows smashed out and stores looted.  State Sen. Howard Marklein, R-Spring Green, decried the destruction in an August 25, 2020, news release and Facebook post.   ""There is absolutely no justification for the vandalism, destruction, rioting and looting that took place at the State Capitol, in the City of Madison or the City of Kenosha last night,"" Marklein posted on Facebook. Then he took aim at the state’s Democratic leaders. ""We need leadership in this state to take a stand, protect our citizens and call for peace, rather than capitulating to violent mobs. Governor Tony Evers and Lieutenant Governor Mandela Barnes made irresponsible comments about the incident in Kenosha before having all of the facts. They did not call for peace. They did not encourage calm.""  The statement came before a night of chaos involving protesters and armed militia members left two men dead and a third man injured. Kyle Rittenhouse, 17, of Antioch, Ill., is charged with shooting the men. Rittenhouse is a self-described militia member. We’ll focus on the last part of Marklein’s claim.  Did Evers and Barnes ""not call for peace"" and ""not encourage calm"" in the wake of the Blake shooting? When asked to provide backup for the statement, Katy Prange, Marklein’s chief of staff, focused on the timing and context of statements made by Evers and Barnes. Let’s look at the sequence.  Here is the complete August 23, 2020 news release from the governor’s office, hours after the incident: MADISON — Gov. Evers tonight released the following statement regarding the officer-involved shooting that critically injured a Black man in Kenosha. ""Tonight, Jacob Blake was shot in the back multiple times, in broad daylight, in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Kathy and I join his family, friends, and neighbors in hoping earnestly that he will not succumb to his injuries. While we do not have all of the details yet, what we know for certain is that he is not the first Black man or person to have been shot or injured or mercilessly killed at the hands of individuals in law enforcement in our state or our country. We stand with all those who have and continue to demand justice, equity, and accountability for Black lives in our country—lives like those of George Floyd, of Breonna Taylor, Tony Robinson, Dontre Hamilton, Ernest Lacy, and Sylville Smith. And we stand against excessive use of force and immediate escalation when engaging with Black Wisconsinites. I have said all along that although we must offer our empathy, equally important is our action. In the coming days, we will demand just that of elected officials in our state who have failed to recognize the racism in our state and our country for far too long."" There was no call for peace or calm in the statement. The following morning, Evers’s office issued a video message:  In the video address, neither Evers nor Barnes mentioned the violence or damage from the previous night, but they did ask that those protesting ""do so peacefully.""  Marklein’s statement was posted on Facebook at 11:06 a.m. the next day, August 25. So, that’s our starting point for the accuracy of the claim. We also looked at Barnes’ tweets and Facebook posts, but did not find any reference to calling for peace or calm prior to Marklein’s post. In a news release later that day, Evers said: ""Tonight, and in the days ahead, if you are going to protest, please do so peacefully and safely. Please do not allow the actions of a few distract us from the work we must do together to demand justice, equity, and accountability.""  So, clearly, that statement from Evers -- his strongest on the question of peace and calm -- came after Marklein’s claim. Britt Cudaback, Evers’ deputy communications director, argued Evers had called for a peaceful protest the day before Marklein’s claim, citing the video message Barnes’ communications director Chet Agni, said Marklein was making ""broad claims.""  ""Our administration has been calling for people to exercise their First Amendment rights peacefully and safely since before Sen. Marklein released his statement, just as our administration did during the unrest following the murder of George Floyd months ago,"" he said in an email. That said, our research, and the information provided by the offices of Evers and Barnes, shows a single reference to ""peacefully"" before the Marklein statement was made. Marklein claimed that Evers and Barnes,  after the police shooting of Jacob Blake, ""did not call for peace. They did not encourage calm."" The governor did not call for peace and calm in his statement hours after the incident. But in a video statement posted the next day, Evers urged people planning to protest to ""do so peacefully."" That said, his most direct comments -- saying the Kenosha protests went too far -- didn’t come until after Marklein’s statement",Mostly False,"August 28, 2020"
"Says Kamala Harris said, “If elected & you don’t surrender your guns, I will sign an executive order & the police will show up at your door.”","Sen. Kamala Harris has taken a strong stance on gun control, but has she actually threatened to send police to your house to take your guns? The short answer is no. But that hasn’t stopped social media users from spreading a fabricated quote attributed to her that suggests otherwise. ""If elected & you don’t surrender your guns, I will sign an executive order & the police will show up at your door,"" reads a post attributed to Harris, the newly selected running mate for presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden. Harris didn’t say this. And there is no evidence Harris plans to force people to surrender their guns. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The claim appears to be a mischaracterization of a pledge Harris made during a CNN Presidential Town Hall in April 2019.  ""Upon being elected, I will give the United States Congress 100 days to get their act together and have the courage to pass reasonable gun safety laws, and if they fail to do it, then I will take executive action,"" Harris said during the town hall.  Harris continued, clarifying what her executive action would encompass.  ""And specifically what I will do is put in place a requirement that for anyone who sells more than five guns a year, they are required to do background checks when they sell those guns,"" Harris said. ""I will require that for any gun dealer that breaks the law, the ATF take their license."" During the town hall, Harris did not discuss confiscating guns using law enforcement officers. What’s more, a commitment to use ""executive action"" can refer to more than just executive orders, as the Washington Post reported. At another campaign event in August 2019 in Las Vegas, Harris reiterated her pledge to take action on guns within 100 days of taking office. At that event, she said she would also use executive action to implement ""a ban on the importation of assault rifles into our country."" In a follow-up question, Harris was asked what enforcement of an assault rifles ban might look like. A reporter is heard off-camera asking, ""Does it involve law enforcement essentially going to people’s houses looking for specific banned guns? Does it involve perhaps creating a database of people who are legal gun owners? What kind of process are we talking about here?"" Harris answered by referencing her experience as attorney general in California, when she said law enforcement was permitted to confiscate guns by going to the doors of people who were both ""found by a court to be a danger to themselves and others"" and were also ""on a list where they were precluded and prohibited from owning a gun because of a conviction.""   ""I have to stress, lawful gun ownership, that is one thing. We’re talking about something else and we have to stop conflating and blending all these issues,"" Harris said.  Harris did not say she planned to send law enforcement officers to the homes of all gun owners, as the post suggests.  When we first spotted the false quote being shared Aug. 11 on a Facebook page called YET-iheart-NRA, PolitiFact reached out to the page administrator to ask what evidence they had to support the claim. Someone with the Facebook page responded, pointing us to an article from the blog Law Enforcement Today. That article referenced an exchange between Biden and Harris in the September 2019 Democratic presidential primary debate, found here.  In it, debate moderator David Muir of ABC’s World News Tonight pointed out that Harris said she planned to use executive action to ban imports of AR-15 assault weapons if Congress did not act quickly enough. Muir explained that Biden had expressed doubts about the future president’s ""constitutional authority"" to ban assault weapons via executive order, which Harris had not committed to doing.  When asked if Biden’s stated concern had a point, Harris jokingly replied, ""I mean I would just say, ‘Hey Joe, instead of saying no we can’t, let’s say yes we can.’"" Here again, there is no evidence she made the statement that is being attributed to her. (The post made by YET-iheart-NRA appears to have been removed since we inquired about it.) Other fact-checking organizations debunked similar claims that circulated online in 2019, but Harris’ new role as vice presidential candidate caused the claim to reemerge. Fact-checking organizations have continued debunking the claim after it reappeared. A post claims that vice presidential candidate Sen. Kamala Harris said, ""If elected & you don’t surrender your guns, I will sign an executive order & the police will show up at your door."" This quote is fabricated. When she was running for president, Harris pledged to take executive action on gun control within the first 100 days of her administration. She did not say she would require people to surrender their guns or say she would order law enforcement to collect guns",False,"August 17, 2020"
Says Joe Biden has said 150 million Americans died from guns and another 120 million from COVID-19,"Former Vice President Joe Biden has drawn mockery and criticism — primarily from conservatives — for verbal missteps throughout his presidential campaign. One recent Facebook post pulled out two statistical claims in particular, connected to gun violence and COVID-19. The July 13, 2020, post said with a laughing emoji: ""America has around 300 million people. Joe Biden said 150 MILLION were lost to gun violence AND we just lost ANOTHER 120 million to covid-19. So I’m reaching out to my friends to see if ANY of you are still alive"" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook). This is obviously a joke, but it raises a question about Biden’s comments. Did he really claim both of those statistics at some point?   Yes, Biden made these claims on two separate occasions, though for one he corrected himself immediately. Biden made the claim regarding the U.S. COVID-19 death toll on June 25, 2020, at a campaign event in Pennsylvania. He was talking about health care coverage with families. An ABC News Facebook Live video shows an attendee at the event mentioned the stress she felt over finances in addition to stress from hospital treatments, and how it all lowered her already low mental health at that time. Biden answered he intended to invest in mental health. ""That’s why we have a major multibillion dollar investment in mental health,"" Biden said. ""What people drastically underestimate is the impact on the mental health of people who now, everything is complicated. People don’t have a job. People don’t have anywhere to go. They don’t know what they’re going to do."" He went on to say ""Now we have over 120 million dead from COVID, I mean, 120,000 dead from COVID,"" according to audio obtained by Snopes.com. Biden made the gun violence claim in the final Democratic primary debate on Feb. 25, 2020, in South Carolina, where he said that 150 million Americans died since 2007 due to gun violence. ""In addition to that, I passed the Brady Bill with waiting periods. I led that fight. But my friend on my right,"" Biden said, gesturing to U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, ""and others have in fact also gave in to the gun manufacturers absolute immunity. Imagine if I stood here and said we give immunity to drug companies. We give immunity to tobacco companies. That has caused carnage on our streets; 150 million people have been killed since 2007 when Bernie voted to exempt gun manufacturers from liability. More than all the wars, including Vietnam, from that point on."" So, the Facebook post is correct in that he made these claims, though it omits the date range Biden used and doesn’t give Biden credit for immediately correcting the COVID data error. In both cases, Biden or his staff acknowledged he intended to say thousands, not millions.  As Biden noted a moment after referencing millions of COVID deaths the current death toll remains in the thousands. As of June 25, 2020 when he made this statement, the death toll was more than 119,000, according to the John Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center dashboard. On the gun violence claim, a member of Biden’s campaign said Biden meant to say 150,000 people. Biden has previously referenced that stat correctly. Data from the CDC shows from 2007 to 2018 there were 148,182 firearm homicides. A Facebook post said Biden said 120 million Americans died from COVID-19 and that 150 million Americans died from gun violence since 2007.  Both of those numbers are drastically wrong. Biden meant to say ""thousands"" in both cases, not ""millions.""

""They have no rationale for being owned by individuals on the street,"" Biden said. ""They should be outlawed. … From the very beginning you weren't allowed to have certain weapons. You weren't allowed to own a cannon during the Revolutionary War as an individual."" Screenshot from Biden's video A reader suggested we look at Biden’s assertion on Revolutionary War cannons. The historians we reached out to were dubious. To confirm Biden’s point, ""you would need to point to something — a law, or a tradition, or a case where someone was not allowed to possess a cannon,"" said University of Pennsylvania law professor Kermit Roosevelt. But the Biden campaign was unable to point to a specific law. ""The vice president's point is that to help end the tragic epidemic of mass shootings that is taking so many American lives, we need to ban weapons of war from our streets,"" the campaign told PolitiFact. Historians say they are doubtful that there were laws to bar individual ownership of cannons during the Revolutionary War period. ""It seems highly unlikely that there were restrictions on the private ownership"" of cannons, said Julie Anne Sweet, a historian and director of military studies at Baylor University. David Kopel, the research director and Second Amendment project director at the free-market Independence Institute, agreed. ""I am not aware of a ban on any arm in colonial America,"" he said. ""There were controls on people or locations, but not bans on types of arms."" The legal framework in the colonies was haphazard during the Revolutionary War period. ""At that time, there was no United States, just a bunch of very confused former colonies trying to cooperate, and often failing, to defeat the British military,"" Sweet said. ""Any sort of gun regulations would have been at the local level, and therefore incredibly difficult and tedious to chase down. The new states were still writing new constitutions and probably did not take this matter into consideration."" There is at least one group of private citizens that owned cannons during the period: privateers. Privateers were privately owned and operated ships that in wartime captured enemy ships for profit. While privateers received a license from the government that allowed them to avoid being prosecuted for piracy, they were not a part of the official navy. So any cannons they set sail with (or that they seized from the enemy) would be private property, not the property of the government or the regular military. The 1899 book ""A History of American Privateers"" by Edgar Stanton Maclay notes several cases in which privateers during the Revolutionary War set sail using cannons. Biden said, ""You weren't allowed to own a cannon during the Revolutionary War as an individual."" The campaign was unable to come up with an example of a law banning private ownership of cannons, and historians of the period doubt that any existed. To the contrary, there are documented instances of privateers, or privately owned vessels, setting sail with cannons during the period",False,"June 29, 2020"

We couldn’t find any state where wearing a protective mask while carrying a concealed weapon is currently banned. Here’s a look at the situation in several states, some of which were the subject of similar Facebook claims: North Carolina: We’ve rated as False a claim that in North Carolina, ""you can be charged with a felony for wearing a mask and concealed carrying."" A state law — sometimes known as the anti-Ku Klux Klan law — forbids adults to conceal their identities in public. But it applies whether they’re carrying a concealed weapon or not. And the law was suspended in May for the coronavirus, although it expires Aug. 1. Georgia: Fordham University law professor Nicholas Johnson noted that Georgia has a KKK-related law similar to North Carolina’s. But that law was suspended for people wearing masks because of the coronavirus in an April executive order from Gov. Brian Kemp. Oregon: ""Oregon law does not prohibit someone from wearing a mask while lawfully carrying a concealed weapon,"" reads a June 25 statement from Marion County Sheriff's Office.  South Carolina: ""There is no South Carolina concealed-weapons permit law that prohibits a South Carolina CWP holder from wearing a mask to comply with a city or a county health ordinance or to help stop the spread of COVID-19 while carrying a concealed weapon,"" reads a June 25 statement from the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division. Utah: ""Utah law has no prohibition against carrying a concealed firearm and wearing a mask,"" tweeted the Utah Department of Public Safety, June 24. Virginia: Virginia has a law that generally prohibits the wearing of masks to conceal identity. Gov. Ralph Northam issued an executive order requiring masks for the coronavirus, leading to questions about concealed carry. The Augusta County Sheriff’s Office said May 28: ""This order doesn’t restrict your ability to conceal a firearm legally",False,"June 29, 2020"
"In North Carolina, “you can be charged with a class H felony for wearing a mask and concealed carrying.”","In North Carolina, some residents are speculating about the ripple effects of Gov. Roy Cooper’s mandate that people wear masks in public. One Facebook post, which was viewed hundreds of times, said the mandate will infringe upon North Carolinians’ Second Amendment rights. ""For those of you like myself that has your concealed carry permit and carry, you can be charged with a class H felony for wearing a mask and concealed carrying,"" it says, adding: ""Once you have a felony(,) you can no longer carry."" Is that true? No. A spokesman for Cooper, who is a Democrat, a spokesman for the Republican state Senate leader, and the leader of the state’s leading gun rights group all agree: North Carolinians are allowed to wear a mask and carry a concealed weapon. The Facebook post references North Carolina’s General Statute 14-12. That statute, specifically 14-12.7, forbids adults from concealing their identities in public. But it doesn’t mention guns at all. And it passed decades ago to target the Ku Klux Klan, according to WRAL. The mask law was suspended in May when state lawmakers passed their coronavirus relief package.  The law now says ""any person wearing a mask for the purpose of ensuring the physical health or safety of the wearer or others"" is exempt from state law prohibiting masks in public. It’s set to expire Aug. 1. But even when it does expire, experts told us they don’t believe there will be a conflict between mask laws and concealed carry laws. Pat Ryan, a spokesman for Senate leader Phil Berger, told PolitiFact that the anti-mask law applies ""irrespective of whether a person is carrying a weapon or not."" ""No statute exists that treats carrying a concealed weapon while masked differently than any other activity while masked,"" Ryan said. Grass Roots North Carolina, one of the state’s leading advocates for Second Amendment rights, interprets the mask laws the same way. Paul Valone, president of Grass Roots NC, told PolitiFact in a phone interview that he’s aware of the rumors.  He says they’re inaccurate and could potentially discourage someone from carrying their concealed weapon and protecting themselves. Valone posted a letter from the group’s lawyer on its Facebook page. ""At your request, I have investigate(d) the rampant rumors that NC law makes it a felony to carry a firearm while wearing a mask – even if the individual holds a valid Concealed Handgun Permit,"" wrote Ed Green, the group’s Director of Legal Affairs. ""There is no such law."" Green explained the mask and concealed carry laws this way: ""There is no law that makes wearing a mask illegal because one is carrying a firearm, and there is no law that makes carrying a firearm illegal because one is wearing a mask."" Asked if it’s illegal to carry a concealed weapon while wearing a mask, Cooper spokesman Ford Porter said: ""Having reviewed the concealed carry statute, our office does not believe this is the case",False,"June 26, 2020"
"Says Nate McMurray said that “gun owners are part of the most insecure and dangerous club on earth,” that “the NRA are homegrown terrorists,” and that “abortion opponents are the American Taliban.”","Republican Chris Jacobs and Democrat Nate McMurray are facing off in a June 23 special election for a congressional seat in western New York, and may also face each other in the regular election in November. Their June 13 debate got heated. In the debate, Jacobs, a state senator, brought attention to past tweets by McMuray, his rival to fill the 27th district vacancy created when Republican Rep. Chris Collins stepped down earlier this year. Here’s a rundown of three assertions by Jacobs, with an analysis of their accuracy. Jacobs said, ""Nate tweeted, ‘Gun owners are part of the most insecure and dangerous club on earth.’""  During the debate, McMurray countered that Jacobs ""is literally making stuff up.""  Both sides have a point. McMurray did tweet about ""the most insecure and dangerous club"" last year, but Jacobs suggested that McMurray had targeted a broader group of gun owners for that description. Jacobs was referring to an Aug. 3, 2019, tweet in which McMurray said, ""YOU WANT TO BE A MAN? Make something. Build something. Better, help someone. Serve someone. Care for them. Your damn assault rifle has no part in that. It just makes part of the most insecure and dangerous club in the world."" YOU WANT TO BE A MAN? Make something. Build something. Better, help someone. Serve someone. Care for them. Your damn assault rifle has no part in that. It just makes part of the most insecure and dangerous club in the world. Kate Walker McArdle, McMurray’s communication director, said Jacobs had unfairly conflated ""gun owners"" with ""assault rifle"" owners. McMurray ""specifically referenced assault-style weapons in his tweet,"" she said. ""While Nate is a gun owner, he was also conveying the fact that owning an assault rifle doesn't make one a ‘man.’  His vision for America does not include assault weapons."" Soon after, Jacobs said that McMurray had ""said the NRA are homegrown terrorists."" (The NRA is the National Rifle Association, a prominent pro-gun group.) Here too, Jacobs has a point, though he oversimplifies a bit. On March 8, 2018, McMurray tweeted a response to a video advertisement from NRATV, an NRA affiliate, that featured conservative commentator Dana Loesch holding a large hourglass.  In his tweeted response, McMurray wrote, ""If ISIS made a video as threatening as the NRA’s hourglass offering, we would all be legitimately freaked out. Who is behind this ‘genius’ marketing? Are they channeling Margaret Hamilton in the Wizard of Oz? Yikes. #HomeGrownTerrorism"" If ISIS made a video as threatening as the NRA’s hourglass offering, we would all be legitimately freaked out. Who is behind this “genius” marketing? Are they channeling Margaret Hamilton in the Wizard of Oz? Yikes. #HomeGrownTerrorism pic.twitter.com/IkBGdNMNkG So McMurray did not outright call the NRA ""homegrown terrorists,"" his use of the hashtag above essentially aligns with Jacobs’ claim.  Walker McArdle told PolitiFact, ""This tweet was calling out the NRA for their scare tactics and videos that were highly scrutinized for threatening violence against Americans and journalists. (McMurray) did not say, ‘the NRA is a terrorist organization.’"" Jacobs pulled a third claim from McMurray’s Twitter feed before the end of the night.  Jacobs said, ""I am pro-life; (McMurray) is pro-abortion. He said abortion opponents are the American Taliban. That’s another tweet of Nate McMurray."" McMurray has in fact referenced the ""Taliban"" or the ""American Taliban"" in tweets about abortion before. On July 3, 2018, McMurray tweeted, ""DO THE MATH: 67% of the public is pro choice according to recent polls. Only 2 Republican members of Congress are pro-choice. 1 President actually said he wants to PUNISH women for abortion. Forget Democracy, forget mental health, act like the Taliban and PUNISH women.

Walker McArdle countered, ""Nate did not use the phrase ‘American Taliban.’ Just as the phrase ‘act like spoiled children’ do(es) not literally mean that the person is a spoiled child, ‘act like the Taliban’ doesn’t literally suggest someone is a member of the Taliban. But if the accusation is that Nate does not believe women should be punished for getting an abortion, that is correct."" Jacobs’ campaign team did not provide any further information or context for what Jacobs said during the debate. Jacobs said McMurray had said that ""gun owners are part of the most insecure and dangerous club on earth,"" that ""the NRA are homegrown terrorists,"" and that ""abortion opponents are the American Taliban."" In each case, McMurray did tweet something very close to what Jacobs cited in the debate, although sometimes with slightly different wording from what Jacobs used. The biggest divergence was in the first of these claims, in which McMurray was referring to people who own assault weapons rather than gun owners more generally",Mostly True,"June 18, 2020"

(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It’s been around for at least a couple of years; Snopes checked this same claim and image in 2018. We looked at training and gun-related deaths and found that while the numbers for the Nordic countries are largely accurate, the numbers fall apart when we get to the U.S. statistics. And while the overall claim that the U.S. has less police training and more civilian deaths at the hands of police is accurate, this idea falls short in that it presumes a direct link between police training and fatal civilian encounters and does not take into consideration additional factors like each country’s gun culture. The U.S. has more gun violence than any other large, wealthy country and ranks the 28th-highest rate of gun violence in the world, according to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. The U.S. also has the highest concentration of guns owned by civilians, with 120.5 guns for every 100 residents. The second highest rate of gun ownership is in Yemen with 52.8 guns for every 100 residents. Iceland and Finland are in the top ten gun-owning countries, with a little over 30 guns for every 100 residents.  Finland has the 11th highest rate of intentional homicides in Europe, which is considered average compared to other European countries but high for a Nordic country. However, in 2017, the U.S. homicide rate was four times the homicide rate in Finland. And, as of 2015, the U.S. gun-related homicide rate was more than four times Finland's. Iceland hasn’t had a gun-related civilian murder since 2007. And while Norway is known for having a high gun-owning rate, it has a low rate of gun violence compared to the rest of Europe. In a Washington Post article on police shootings, leading criminologist Geoffrey Alpert described how researchers struggle to pinpoint why the U.S. has had so many fatal police shootings.  ""We’ve looked at this data in so many ways, including whether race, geography, violent crime, gun ownership or police training can explain it,"" he said. ""But none of those factors alone can explain how consistent this number appears to be."" George Washington Law Professor Cynthia Lee in the 2018 University of Illinois Law Review wrote that ""only a multiplicity of reforms"" will reduce fatal police shootings and lead to ""lasting structural changes in policing.""  The claim that Norway requires three years of training and has had four people killed since 2002  is accurate. According to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, which calls itself the world’s largest regional security organization, basic police training in Norway includes a three-year college education at the Norwegian Police University College. Trainees study at the college in their first and third years and spend their second year in on-the-ground training. The Norwegian Bureau for the Investigation of Police Affairs releases annual reports on police encounters they have investigated and articles on policing trends. In 2014, the report included an article on police shootings. In all 15 police shootings the bureau had investigated ""16 persons have been injured… and, in two of these cases, the injuries resulted in death."" A European news network called The Local reported in 2016 that there had been a fatal police shooting in 2015 and another in 2016 that marked ""the fourth time that police in Norway have been involved in a fatal shooting since 2002.""  The Norwegian Bureau for the Investigation of Police Affairs’ most recent report was from 2018 and it doesn’t list any fatal shootings. Searching recent news, we couldn’t find another story on fatal police shootings in Norway from 2019 or 2020. The claim that Finland requires two years of training and has seven people killed since 2000 is a bit off. The country’s police training program takes more than two years, and there is a little more information to be considered when calculating the number of deaths. Like Norway, Finland’s Police University College has a policing bachelors program. It requires students to complete 180 credit points, which usually takes three years to complete, not two like the post claims. Snopes reviewed and shared a list of 2000-18 police-related fatalities from the Finland National Police Board. Contacted by PolitIFact, Liisa Haapanen, the board’s senior communication adviser, verified the accuracy of the list and said that the numbers have not changed. The list details nine police-related fatalities, including a 2012 case in which a person died after an officer deployed a Taser; the report says it is unclear how electric shocks contributed to his death. The report also includes a 2010 incident in which a security guard was fatally shot after a police officer ""accidentally discharged"" their weapon. The post’s claim that Iceland requires two years of training and that one person has been killed is right. Iceland has very little violent crime. Iceland’s police university, the University of Akureyri, offers a bachelor's degree for police and law enforcement that has a two-year schedule. In 2013, Iceland’s first-ever fatal police shooting generated a lot of media coverage. The police department apologized to the victim’s family. The Reykjavík Police chief said the event would be thoroughly investigated and the police officers involved received grief counseling.  Ásgeir Sverrisson, The National Commissioner of the Icelandic Police, verified with PolitiFact that the 2013 shooting was the only fatal police shooting in Iceland’s history but that there have been instances in which citizens died in police custody or following police confrontations.  This Facebook’s most misleading claims come when it summarizes police training and officer-involved fatalities in the U.S. It says the U.S. requires 21 weeks of training and has experienced ""8,000+ people killed since 2001."" The best data suggest a number far higher than 8,000. Where the post has a point is that initial U.S. police training requirements are shorter than in these Nordic countries. U.S. police academies vary. A 2016 Bureau of Justice Statistics review found that from 2011 to 2013, most academy training lasts ""an average of about 840 hours, or 21 weeks.""  Nearly all police officers completed a mandatory field training after their basic training according to that 2013 report. About 37% of field training programs are organized by academies that require an average of 500 additional hours, or over 12 weeks, to complete field training. Based on these numbers, police officers have an average of 33 weeks of training. Based on that 2016 report, U.S. police officers are trained for almost eight months, and about three months of that training is in the field. The bigger problem in analyzing the post is that there are only estimates for the number of people killed by police.  The Bureau of Justice Statistics recorded arrest-related deaths from 2003-09. During that seven-year period, there were 4,813 reported deaths from ""law enforcement personnel attempting to arrest or restrain"" citizens. About 60% of those deaths, 2,931 of them, were ruled a homicide. There is no data in the report that indicates how many of these were gun-related. Though the FBI in 2019 launched the National Use-of-Force Data Collection effort, law enforcement agencies are not required to participate and the FBI has not yet released any findings. The Washington Post in 2015 started recording fatal shooting victims and found that police have shot and killed about 5,400 people in the five years since — roughly 1,000 people a year.  Fatal Encounters, a database created by a journalist, tracks deaths of people killed by law enforcement with crowd-sourced information and paid researchers, using public records and news reports. The database lists over 28,000 people who have been killed while interacting with law enforcement since 2000. About 20,300 were the result of firearms. A Facebook post compared the number of fatal gun-related police encounters and the length of police training in three Nordic countries and the U.S. ""Cops in Norway: require 3 years of training, 4 people killed since 2002. Cops in Finland: require 2 years of training, 7 people killed since 2000. Cops in Iceland: require 2 years of training, 1 person killed since ever. Cops in the U.S.: require 21 weeks of training, 8,000+ people killed since 2001."" The numbers in this claim were partly accurate. Finland’s police training takes longer than two years, and it had two more police-related deaths. The claims about U.S. policing were the most inaccurate. Police academies and departments usually require more than 21 weeks of training and estimates for fatal police shootings point to about 20,000 deaths in the past 20 years. What’s missing most from the post, however, is context. The rate of gun violence and gun ownership is higher in the U.S. than in these other countries. Research has also shown that fatal police shootings are the result of a combination of factors and are not limited to time spent in police training alone. Experts say there needs to be structural U.S. policing reform, not just more time spent intraining",Half True,"June 16, 2020"

There have been reports of looting and violence at some protests, and law enforcement entities have come under fire for tactics used against participants and journalists covering the events.  A Facebook post circulating online urges Texans to take advantage of a recently passed state law allowing people to carry firearms during disasters. The post claimed the law, adopted in 2019, ""allows any Texan who can legally own a firearm to carry their handgun, open or concealed, for a full week after a state or natural disaster is declared.""  ""Arm yourselves, protect your family, loved ones and neighbors,"" the post reads. ""Stand together, Stand your ground, protect your family and your property. If you feel threatened, You have every right to protect yourselves!  Be vigilant and look out for one another, stay safe."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Texas Gov. Greg Abbott issued a disaster declaration on May 31 in response to violence that broke out at protests in some parts of the state. The law highlighted in the post moved through the state’s legislature as House Bill 1177 and it  was authored by state Rep. Dade Phelan, a Republican from Beaumont. The bill does regulate firearm usage during a natural disaster, but it was passed with 2017’s Hurricane Harvey front of mind, with lawmakers arguing that the measure was necessary to give survivors of natural disasters a way to protect themselves and their property. But does it apply to this situation? We decided to find out. ‘Evacuating from an area’ HB 1177 allows handgun license holders and other Texans who are not prohibited by law from possessing a firearm to legally carry and transport their handguns during a mandatory emergency evacuation. It includes parameters that dictate when the law is applicable: not only must there be a state of disaster, but a person must also be ""evacuating from an area following the declaration of a state of disaster"" or ""reentering that area following the person’s evacuation.""  The post does not make mention of the circumstances that would trigger this protection and insinuates that the law applies at any time within a week of a disaster declaration. For this reason, Lauren Lumsden, Phelan’s legislative director, said it was inaccurate. ""It does not appear that the Facebook post was a correct application of the bill, since they do not seem to be evacuating,"" she said.  Attorneys specializing in government law reached by PolitiFact agreed with that interpretation. ""Assuming that the Governor has declared a qualifying state of disaster, it is my opinion that the statute does not allow the unrestricted open carrying of handguns,"" said Texas appellate attorney and former Texas Assistant Solicitor General Ryan Clinton. ""Rather, it allows handguns to be openly carried when a person is ‘evacuating from’ or ‘reentering’ an area following the declaration of a state of disaster in the area."" Clinton also noted that the law does not apply to people who are otherwise banned from having a firearm under state or federal law. Mike Cox, legislative director of the Texas State Rifle Association, said many members had reached out to the organization about similar claims. After consulting with attorney Richard D. Hayes, II, of Houston-based law firm Walker & Taylor, Cox said he agreed that the law does not currently apply. ""The circumstances that would allow for the unlicensed carry of a handgun after a declared disaster are fairly limited,"" Hayes said in a blog post and video on the matter. ""It doesn’t suspend 46.02 for all purposes. It really relates to evacuating.""

“Getting access to a gun in America is easier than adopting a dog or registering to vote.”,"Wisconsin state Rep. Chris Taylor, D-Madison, has a take on why gun control is badly needed:  ""Getting access to a gun in America is easier than adopting a dog or registering to vote."" The statement was made in a Dec. 13, 2019 news release, on the anniversary of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. But it mirrored many statements that came in the wake of the Feb. 26, 2020 shooting at the Miller brewery complex in Milwaukee.  And it remains somewhat of a timeless talking point.  In the release, Taylor said she vividly remembered the day the Sandy Hook shooting took place, as her son was in first grade at the time. She then said that Republican lawmakers are no closer to enacting legislation that would protect children from gun violence now than they were then.  We asked Taylor for backup, her staff sent back information on the laws and regulations surrounding gun ownership, dog ownership and voting in Wisconsin.  So we’ll start there.  Is it easier to get a gun than to adopt a four-legged friend or register to vote?  PolitiFact Wisconsin has previously written about gun sales in Wisconsin, and how purchases through a licensed dealer are different from purchases from a private seller.  If someone buys a gun from a licensed dealer, they must undergo a background check. For handguns, that check is run by the state Department of Justice. For long guns -- such as rifles or shotguns -- the check is through the National Criminal Background Check System.  Under state law, the buyer must show photo identification to the seller. Then he or she must fill out three copies of DOJ-issued documents, one for the seller, one for the buyer and one that is  sent to the DOJ after the purchase.  After the forms are completed, the seller contacts the DOJ, which charges $10 to run the check, or the National Criminal Check System. If the check turns up clear, the buyer can leave the store with the gun.  In 2019, some 294,999 guns were purchased from a licensed dealer in Wisconsin, according to Gillian Drummond, DOJ communications director. The department does not, however, track how many guns are sold in Wisconsin from non-licensed dealers, she said in an email.  Private gun sales work a bit differently.  They’re not regulated by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, according to the agency’s website. Wisconsin doesn’t regulate private sales, either, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, a group that advocates tighter restrictions on gun ownership.  Private sales can also be conducted through web sites such as Armslist or even Craigslist, taking out the process of a background check completely.  So, circling back to Taylors claim: While many gun sales require a background check, private purchases can be made with little or no scrutiny at all.  The process for adopting a dog in Wisconsin may vary from organization to organization, but for the Wisconsin Humane Society, dogs can be adopted in one day, said Angela Speed, vice president of communications.  Potential owners are required to fill out an adopter profile and then meet with a counselor, who will review the adopter’s history and needs to find a compatible four-legged match, she said. The wait to get in with a counselor can vary, from 30 minutes to three hours, depending on the day and how many others are waiting. Then of course, the meeting takes time, too.  ""We talk with each potential adopter about their lifestyle and needs of the animal, the process of meeting takes an additional hour,"" Speed said.  After an adopter is approved and picks a dog, they pay a fee that runs between $25 and $449.  Speed said that sometimes denials happen, though rare. Though the Wisconsin Humane Society doesn’t, some organizations also require home visits after a pet is adopted, Speed said.  After a dog is brought home, an owner must also purchase a dog license for any dog over 5 months old, as required by State Statute section 174.07, and the dog must be kept up-to-date on all immunizations.   So, in comparison to a gun purchase, adopting a dog can take longer and includes a counseling step. It also requires that a license be purchased. As for registering to vote, the process can be done online, in-person at a municipal clerk’s office or at the polling location the day of the election or via mail, according to the Wisconsin Elections Commission’s website, myvote.wi.gov.  If a voter is registering by mail or online, the forms must be completed and sent back to clerks 20 days before the election. For in-person registration, forms can be completed up until the Friday before the election. Voters can also register on voting day at the polls. In order to register to vote, a person needs to have a valid Wisconsin drivers license or ID card that shows that they will be 18 by the day of the election, as well as a current address. If the address on the ID is not current, then the voter must also provide a proof of residence, such as a utility bill or bank statement. If the ID or license is expired, the last four digits of a person’s Social Security number are needed.  If registering online, a photo must be submitted of the ID. If submitting the form via the mail or fax, the ID must be copied, printed and included.  Though registering to vote requires an ID (or part of voter’s social security number or a utility bill), registering does not require a background check, as purchasing a gun from a licensed dealer does.  Taylor claimed that the process of obtaining a gun was easier than adopting a dog or registering to vote. When it comes to private sales, the claim is on target -- there are virtually no checks that happen, so any process with adopting a dog or voting requires more scrutiny. But the picture is muddier when it comes to gun sales through licensed dealers.  In those cases, purchasers face a criminal background check -- which is more than what happens when you adopt a dog or register to vote. That leaves us with a statement that’s accurate but needs clarification or additional information",Mostly True,"May 22, 2020"
Says Gov. Tony Evers is “pushing firearm confiscation orders”,"A year-old claim about Gov. Tony Evers and firearm confiscation is getting new life online amid the coronavirus pandemic. Many on Facebook have recently picked up a story from April 2019 headlined ""Wisconsin gov. pushing firearm confiscation orders."" When shared, no date for the story is visible on Facebook. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The new life and lack of date gives this claim a very different ring amid the flurry of executive orders by Evers. The first-term Democrat has taken a series of dramatic steps to limit activity in Wisconsin as he and officials across the country take steps to contain the spread of coronavirus. His latest ""Safe at Home"" order, issued Tuesday, March 24, 2020, closed non-essential businesses and gathering places until April 24. But none of those orders deals with gun confiscations. The headline was misleading in 2019. Surfaced a year later, it’s downright ridiculous. The article, from a website called Steadfast and Loyal, describes Evers as ""attacking the Second Amendment."" But it offers zero proof for that claim or the headline reference to the governor ""pushing firearm confiscation orders."" Instead it pastes in a series of paragraphs from a similarly headlined story from far-right Breitbart news, published back in January 2019. But neither story actually details Evers proposing any such thing. The Breitbart story — as quoted by Steadfast and Loyal — refers to a WISN-TV story about Attorney General Josh Kaul, a Democrat, calling for red flag laws during his inaugural address. We will note, though the stories didn’t, that Evers had generally voiced support for Kaul’s plan in January 2019. But there’s a huge difference between red flag laws and the widespread gun seizures implied by this headline. Red flag laws provide a mechanism — with a judge’s approval — to take guns from people exhibiting dangerous behavior before they harm themselves or others. At the time the Steadfast and Loyal article was written, Evers hadn’t proposed anything in this vein, but he later did, in November 2019. He called a special session of the Legislature to consider proposals for a red flag law and universal background checks, but Republicans who control the Assembly and Senate immediately closed the session without action. Under Evers’ proposal, a law enforcement officer, family member or household member could petition a judge to intervene if they believe an individual is a danger to self or others. The judge then could issue a preliminary order good for up to 14 days, during which the guns could be taken away. A judge would then schedule a full hearing, where the gun owner could present his or her case and the judge could issue a final order valid for up to one year. A year-old story now circulating again on Facebook says Evers is ""pushing firearm confiscation orders."" That was an overreach in 2019, and it’s even more absurd now. The article was referring to red flag laws, but at the time of this post Evers hadn’t proposed one yet.

The gun-rights organization makes the claim in a November 2019 story that recently resurfaced online, citing comments he made at a fundraiser. But this is misleading. While Biden’s statement did call out guns that use 9 mm ammunition, he was referring to the high-capacity magazines that sometimes come standard, or are added onto, those types of guns. A pistol, according to federal regulations, is a handgun that has its chamber integrated with the barrel. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The NRA article cites a Seattle Times story on two Biden campaign fundraisers in the region. At one point the story says: ""While saying he supports the Second Amendment, Biden called the absolutist arguments of some gun-rights supporters 'bizarre.' Noting people can’t own machine guns or bazookas, Biden said, 'Why should we allow people to have military-style weapons including pistols with 9-mm bullets and can hold 10 or more rounds?'""  So, does that mean Biden wants to ban those pistols? His campaign says no.  ""Predictably, the NRA is lying about the only candidate in this race who has taken them on and beaten them twice,"" Biden campaign spokesman Andrew Bates told PolitiFact.  ""His statement here, as he has often said, is about banning high-capacity magazines for use in any type of weapon. The NRA's support for these magazines, despite the carnage that could not have taken place and the innocent lives that would not have been lost without them, is a moral crisis for that organization."" There is no mention of banning any type of traditional handgun on Biden’s presidential campaign website. Among other measures, his gun control policies include: Banning the manufacture and sale of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines and initiating a buyback of these weapons; closing loopholes in the background check system and requiring checks on all gun sales; and ending the online sale of firearms and ammunitions. Biden has voted on amendments to ban certain rifles, guns considered assault weapons and semi-automatic weapons. But he has no record of supporting measures that would ban traditional pistols.

"“Remember, the American Revolution began when they came for the guns.”","Some Revolutionary War events aren’t covered in the Broadway hit Hamilton. Lord Dunmore’s orders happen to be some of them.  Dunmore, Virginia’s royal governor at the time of war, recently had his chance at the limelight when he was compared with Virginia's current Democratic governor, Ralph Northam, on the issue of gun control State Sen. Eric Burlison, R-Springfield, tweeted: ""Anyone who knows Virginia history can see the comparison with Lord Dunmore and @GovernorVA Ralph Northam. Remember, the American Revolution began when they came for the guns. #2ndAmendment"" Burlison tweeted this the day of a gun rally in Virginia.  More than 22,000 people rallied outside the state Capitol on Jan. 20 in protest of gun control legislation Northam supported. Northam supported a bill that called for the ban of certain assault rifles, but it failed in the state Senate on Feb. 17. Other bills, ranging from giving local Virginian governments more ability to ban concealed carry in public places to reporting stolen guns, passed on Feb. 28. We reached out to Burlison’s office. His staff said that the senator did not mean to imply that Dunmore caused the Revolution, so we’re concentrating here on the sentence about guns. They also cited a History.com article as a summary of the war.  Burlison’s tweet seems to simplify an entire revolution. So, we dusted off the history textbooks. Here’s what we found.  This tweet was meant to call back on American history and use it as a cautionary tale — except the tale was taken out of context.  The first battles of the Revolution were on April 19, 1775, at Lexington and Concord in Massachusetts. The town was alerted before the British arrived. Minutemen stood waiting for them — a shot rang out and the scene became violent. We know a few things for sure:  Gen.Thomas Gage sent Lt. Colonel Smith to lead the British troops to Concord.  Gage received a tip that colonial soldiers in Concord were gathering arms.  The British troops were ordered to destroy gunpowder and arrest the colonial rebels John Hancock and Samuel Adams.  What else were the troops after? While one said arms weren't targeted, another said that guns would've been part of the order to confiscate the armory at Concord. A third, University of Missouri history professor John L. Bullion, showed us the written orders. In a letter from Gage to Smith, Gage orders the destruction of guns — and ammunition, flour, tents, pork or beef, carriages and more.  We should probably take a look at Lord Dunmore. After all, Burlison mentions him in the first half of the tweet.  Lord Dunmore, also known as John Murray, was the last royal governor of Virginia. As tensions grew, Dunmore called for the removal of gunpowder stored in local magazines.  Dunmore was then pressured by the hundreds of countrymen that stormed Williamsburg to either return or pay for the lost gunpowder. Dunmore ended up having to pay 330 pounds (or about $56,000 in today’s dollars).  He became very unpopular and was chased out of his home. Dunmore and his family then had to stay on the British ship Fowley.  However, Dunmore is probably better known for his later 1775 proclamation. It announced that a revolution was underfoot and offered freedom to enslaved people if they fought for the British.  WIth politics, money usually becomes an issue at one point. That goes for what leads up to the revolution, too.  Britain won the French and Indian War, but the fighting wasn’t cheap. The 1764 Currency Act said the colonies couldn’t print their own money, but what caused the biggest uproar was the Stamp Act of the next year. The tax was on all printed paper — including newspapers, legal documents and more.  That kicked off a building frustration for colonists over taxes without representation in the British Parliament. That’s not all, though — more acts were added that taxed more products. More soldiers occupied colonists’ homes.  And the British Parliament made clear it could make whatever laws it liked. Things got worse when five colonists died in the Boston Massacre. Soldiers were convicted of lesser crimes, but not murder. Samuel Adams created committees of correspondence to spread the news about the massacre in 1772.  The following year, some Sons of Liberty members snuck on a tea ship in Boston Harbor. They dumped the tea overboard to protest a monopoly given to the East India Tea Company. Britain retaliated. However, colonists encouraged boycotts, and New England began preparing for war. In 1775, British soldiers attempted to take some ammunition but were turned away. Later, word got out to the British that the growing rebellion might be storing military supplies in Concord.  One day after the first battles, Lord Dunmore made an order to get rid of gunpowder. The rest is (literally) history.  Burlison tweeted that ""the American Revolution began when they came for the guns.""  His tweet was a dramatic simplification of history There were many factors at play that sparked the American Revolution. It was caused by a lack of economic freedom and representation in the government and more.  That said, arms may have been one of many factors in the invasion of Lexington and Concord",Half True,"March 18, 2020"
Says a video of Joe Biden and Beto O’Rourke at a Texas Whataburger shows Biden “looking directly into the camera and promising to take away Americans’ guns if elected.”,"The day before Super Tuesday, Beto O’Rourke said he is endorsing former Vice President Joe Biden in the Democratic presidential primary. At a Dallas rally, Biden thanked O’Rourke, a former rival for the nomination, for his support and told attendees: ""This is not the last you’ve seen of this guy."" ""You’re going to take care of the gun problem with me,"" Biden told O’Rourke, the former Democratic congressman from El Paso, on stage. ""You’re going to be the one who leads this effort. I’m counting on you."" During his own presidential campaign, which ended in November, O’Rourke called for mandatory buybacks of assault style weapons. He famously said during the Sept. 12 debate in Houston: ""Hell yes, we are going to take your AR-15, your AK-47."" Opponents of the proposal have taken O’Rourke’s endorsement, and Biden’s comments about a possible leadership role for O’Rourke, to mean that Biden now supports mandatory buybacks of assault style weapons — a policy he has not backed in the past. Conservative-Daily, an online platform featuring articles with a conservative slant, said in a recent post that Biden has been explicit in his support of the buyback program, which has been equated with ""confiscation"" by gun rights advocates. The post is titled ""Watch: Biden Looks Into The Camera And Promises To Take Away Americans’ Guns"" and includes a 15-second clip cut from a longer Facebook live video of Biden and O’Rourke talking with O’Rourke’s wife Amy O’Rourke at a Whataburger after the Dallas rally. In the clip, Biden says: ""This guy can change the face of what we’re dealing with, with regard to guns, assault weapons, with regard to dealing with climate change. And I’m just warning Amy: If I win, I’m coming for him."" The post states that the video shows Biden agreeing to adopt O’Rourke’s ""most radical gun control proposals."" ""This is a video of Joe Biden looking directly into the camera and promising to take away Americans’ guns if elected,"" the post reads. ""And he had the audacity to make this promise in Texas …"" When asked for clarification, Max McGuire, author of the post, said he heard Biden differently in the video. Instead of saying ""I’m coming for him,"" McGuire said Biden can be heard saying, ""if he wins he is coming for ‘em,’ which we interpreted to mean guns, given the fact that seconds earlier he was praising Beto's gun control advocacy re: assault weapons."" For the record, multiple viewings of the video confirm that Biden is directing his remark to O’Rourke’s wife when he says: ""If I win, I’m coming for him."" He also gestures toward O’Rourke. FactCheck.org also reviewed the video and reported that Biden said ""I’m coming for him,"" in reference to O’Rourke. The footage has been fact-checked by Reuters, which came to the same conclusion about Biden’s remarks. No role for O'Rourke in Biden's camp But McGuire said if Biden had said ""I’m coming for him,"" that means he plans to hire O’Rourke to be part of his administration. ""If he said 'coming for him,' we contend that there is no difference in intention,"" he said. ""Beto O'Rourke has made his gun control intentions clear. If he had been elected, he promised whole-heartedly that ‘hell yes’ he would be coming for Americans' guns. Joe Biden has since made his intention clear to have Beto run his campaign's and/or administration's gun control policy."" But that is inaccurate. Biden did say O’Rourke would work with him on gun policy, but in an interview O’Rourke said he does not have a role in Biden’s campaign and that he has not spoken with Biden or his team about what role he could play in a future administration. O’Rourke also said Biden has not expressed support for his gun safety policies. ""I have not heard him say he would support a mandatory buyback of assault weapons,"" O’Rourke said. Biden’s campaign did not respond to multiple requests for comment, so we turned to his platform on guns and recent public remarks he has made to assess whether his position on mandatory buybacks has shifted. Biden’s platform on guns calls for a ban on the manufacture and sale of assault weapons and high capacity magazines and the establishment of a voluntary program to buy back those weapons already in peoples’ possession. ""This will give individuals who now possess assault weapons or high-capacity magazines two options: sell the weapons to the government, or register them under the National Firearms Act,"" his website reads. In a heated exchange with an auto worker in Detroit on Tuesday, a week after receiving O’Rourke’s endorsement, Biden rejected the idea that he supported taking guns away from people. In a video of the exchange, the man can be heard telling Biden: ""You are actively trying to diminish our Second Amendment right and take away our guns."" Biden told the man that he was ""full of shit"" and added, ""I'm not taking your gun away — at all."" The man cited a video circulating online that shows Biden saying he is ""trying to take our guns."" Biden responded: ""I did not say that. I did not say that. It’s a viral video like the other ones they’re putting out that are simply a lie."" Our Ruling A blog post from Conservative Daily says a video of Biden and O’Rourke at a burger joint in Texas shows Biden ""looking directly into the camera and promising to take away Americans’ guns if elected."" Biden does not say this in the video included in the blog post. The video shows Biden issuing a joking warning to Amy O’Rourke, Beto O’Rourke’s wife, that if Biden is elected, he will be ""coming for him"" — meaning Beto O’Rourke. O’Rourke said he has no formal role in Biden’s campaign and has not spoken with Biden’s team about a job in a potential future administration. Plus the larger point here, that Biden now supports O’Rourke’s proposal for mandatory buybacks, is not accurate.

"On key issues including taxes, health care, the Green New Deal, abortion, and guns, there is “no daylight between” Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden.","The Republican National Committee didn’t waste much time after the Democratic presidential race narrowed to two main candidates to paint Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders with the same brush.  A mass email sent by the RNC on March 5 began with the subject line, ""Biden and Bernie, two sides of the same coin."" It offered about a dozen policy issues where — according to the email at least — the two Democrats had identical stances. The issues include taxes, health care, the Green New Deal, federal abortion funding, the death penalty, and guns. ""It’s official, the Democrat Party is now deciding which near octogenarian career politician will be their nominee,"" the email said. ""And those aren’t the only similarities between Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders. … There is no so-called ‘moderate’ option for Democrats. Just radicalism."" We decided to take a closer look at the email, issue by issue. Here’s what we found. Claim: ""Biden: The ‘the first thing I would do’ is raise middle class taxes. Bernie says he will raise taxes on anyone making over $29,000."" One of Sanders’ options for paying for his Medicare for All proposal is to add an additional 4 percentage points to existing income tax rates for those who earn more than $29,000. So while this is not a guarantee, it is one option Sanders has suggested. Biden hasn’t proposed anything like this. In fact, his tax plan would increase the top marginal rate from 37% to 39.6%, affecting those who earn more than $400,000 — not exactly a middle-class income level. Other aspects of Biden’s tax plan target provisions of special interest to higher-income individuals and corporations, such as capital gains taxes, corporate tax rates, and additional payroll taxes for high earners. *** Claim: ""Biden supports government health care for illegal immigrants. Bernie supports government health care for illegal immigrants."" When we asked the RNC about the assertion about Biden, they pointed to a June 2019 debate in which NBC’s Savannah Guthrie asked all candidates to raise their hand ""if your government plan would provide coverage for undocumented immigrants."" Biden and Sanders, among others, raised their hands. However, this glosses over some nuances in their positions. Sanders would provide coverage to undocumented immigrants under his single-payer insurance plan; he has tweeted, ""If you are a human being, regardless of your immigration status, you have a right to health care.""  Biden would not go quite that far. Under Biden’s proposal, undocumented immigrants would be able to buy insurance from the Affordable Care Act marketplaces — from which they are currently barred — but would not be able to receive federal subsidies that make these plans affordable.  If undocumented immigrants bought plans without subsidies, they wouldn’t be receiving government health care, as the email claims — they would be signing up for private insurance plans in the marketplace. *** Claim: ""Biden supports a government takeover of health care. Not only does Biden’s plan not allow Americans to keep their private health insurance, it guarantees ‘massive disruptions to private coverage.’ Bernie supports a government takeover of health care. Bernie’s health care agenda eliminates private health insurance."" Sanders would create a single-payer system in which the government acts as the health insurer for everyone, effectively supplanting most private insurance. This plan would ""provide everyone in America with comprehensive health care coverage, free at the point of service,"" Sanders’ campaign website says.  Biden offers a more modest alternative, in which individuals could voluntarily buy in to the federal Medicare program for their insurance. Under Biden’s proposal, private insurance would remain part of the health insurance market. ""Instead of starting from scratch and getting rid of private insurance, he has a plan to build on the Affordable Care Act by giving Americans more choice, reducing health care costs, and making our health care system less complex to navigate,"" Biden’s campaign website says. *** Claim: ""Biden supports free college. Bernie supports free college."" This is substantially misleading. Sanders would ""guarantee tuition and debt-free public colleges, universities,"" trade schools, and historically black colleges. Biden’s proposals apply only to community colleges. Biden would provide ""two years of community college or other high-quality training program without debt for any hard-working individual."" Claim: ""Biden supports reparations. Bernie supports reparations."" Biden and Sanders have both said they support an official process to study the question of whether the descendants of slaves should receive reparations, but it’s too strong a statement to say they support the idea. As recently as 2019, Sanders was dismissive of reparations, but he later announced his support for a bill that would establish a commission to study the issue. Biden, meanwhile, told the Washington Post that his administration would ""study how reparations may be part of"" efforts to curb racism ""and ensure the voices of descendants are central when gathering data and information."" The Biden campaign also told Vice that he thinks the U.S. should ""gather the data necessary to have an informed conversation about reparations."" *** Claim: ""Biden promised to end illegal immigration detention ‘across the board,’ and to not deport illegal immigrants who have committed felony-like offenses in other countries. Bernie backs a moratorium on all deportations of illegal immigrants in U.S. and says that it is not ‘appropriate’ to deport illegal immigrants not following law in the U.S."" This is largely accurate. The email cites a comment by Biden at a Vice News event when he was asked, ""How exactly would you detain immigrants?"" He said, ""I would not retain them behind bars … They show up, and you have an ankle bracelet (and) you set a hearing. We have to surge to the border, to the areas where people are being held. Get rid of all the cages, everybody out of prisons. The most you put on is an ankle bracelet, and you give a date when you show up for an immigration hearing, and you show up."" Asked whether that was for adults and children, Biden said, ""across the board."" The email also cited a separate town hall comment by Biden in which he promised that in his first 100 days in office, deportations would only be carried out for felonies committed in the United States. Sanders, for his part, says on his website that he would ""dismantle"" deportation programs and detention centers and ""institute a moratorium on deportations until a thorough audit of past practices and policies is complete."" *** Claim: ""Biden supports the Green New Deal, ""radical decarbonization,"" and eliminating fossil fuels even if that means sacrificing hundreds of thousands of blue-collar jobs. Bernie supports the Green New Deal, eliminating fossil fuels, and is okay with sacrificing American jobs for his climate agenda."" Sanders is a proud supporter of the Green New Deal — he is a leading co-sponsor of the Senate version of the resolution, which is an aspirational document that sets goals for combating climate change through reductions in carbon emissions, increased energy efficiency, and expansions of clean-energy infrastructure. Biden isn’t as vocal a supporter of the legislation specifically, but he has name-checked the plan on his campaign website and echoed some of its language in his climate change policy. ""Biden believes the Green New Deal is a crucial framework for meeting the climate challenges we face,"" Biden’s campaign website says. ""It powerfully captures two basic truths, which are at the core of his plan: (1) the United States urgently needs to embrace greater ambition on an epic scale to meet the scope of this challenge, and (2) our environment and our economy are completely and totally connected."" Among other things, Biden seeks to achieve a ""100% clean energy economy"" later than 2050.  The email is also correct that Biden responded affirmatively to a question in a Democratic debate that he’s OK with thousands or even hundreds of thousands of job losses in carbon-based energies as part of the transition to renewable energy. *** Claim: ""Biden supports federal funds for abortions after repealing the Hyde Amendment. Bernie supports federal funding for abortions as well as the repealing of the Hyde Amendment."" Repealing the decades-old Hyde Amendment — which bars the use of federal funds for abortions — is a goal Biden and Sanders share. Biden is a relatively recent convert to this position. After sustaining attacks from other Democratic presidential candidates, including Sanders, Biden announced in June 2019 that he would be seeking an end to the restriction. *** Claim: ""Biden supports an end to the death penalty. Bernie wants to end the death penalty."" This is another issue both candidates agree on. Biden’s campaign website says that he would ""eliminate the death penalty"" by ending it at the federal level and encourage states to do the same. Death row inmates would instead serve life sentences without parole. *** Claim: ""Biden supports a federal ‘assault weapon’ ban. Bernie supports a federal ‘assault weapon’ ban."" The two candidates agree on this as well. Biden’s website says he supports a ban on the manufacture and sale of assault weapons. He would also seek to tighten regulation of existing assault weapons and pursue buybacks. Sanders’ proposals are essentially identical: Banning the sale and distribution of assault weapons, tightening regulations and implementing a buyback program. The Republican National Committee said in a mass email that on about a dozen issues, there is ""no daylight between"" Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden. The email accurately portrays the candidates’ similarities on roughly half of the issues cited, including their positions on federal abortion funding, ending the death penalty, banning assault weapons, and the Green New Deal. However, the email is incorrect on a similar number of other issues, including taxes, health care, free college tuition, and reparations for slavery",Half True,"March 10, 2020"
Says Bernie Sanders “voted against the Brady Bill five times for background checks on people.”,"Former Vice President Joe Biden went after his presidential campaign rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., over gun policy during an interview with NBC’s Savannah Guthrie. Sanders ""voted against the Brady Bill five times for background checks on people,"" Biden said in the March 5 interview. The Brady Bill line was also an attack that Sanders’ 2016 presidential rival, Hillary Clinton, used, and Biden, like Clinton before him, is correct about the number of times Sanders voted against the landmark gun law, which among other things would have tightened background check requirements. However, Biden’s assertion glosses over the fact that Sanders now supports tighter background checks. Before it became law in 1993, the Brady bill underwent many transformations. Sanders, then Vermont’s sole representative in the U.S. House of Representatives, voted against the bill in its entirety five times: 1. In May 1991, Sanders voted against a version that mandated a seven-day waiting period. The bill passed in the House.   2. The Senate then voted to decrease the waiting period to five days, and the bill returned to the House. In November 1991, Sanders voted against that version. Although it passed in the House, the Senate didn’t muster enough votes for the new version. 3. After some back and forth, a bill resurfaced that reinstated the five-day waiting period. In November 1993, Sanders voted against that version twice in the same day.  4. Sanders voted against an amendment that would have ended state waiting periods, and for an amendment giving those denied a gun the right to know why. 5. The final compromise version of the Brady bill —  an interim five-day waiting period while installing an instant background check system — was passed and signed into law on Nov. 30, 1993. Sanders voted against it. The Sanders campaign told PolitiFact in 2015 that Sanders voted against the bill because he believed a national waiting period was a federal overreach and because he was answering to his constituents. Sanders’ early votes against the Brady Bill reflected his constituents’ views on guns in the rural state of Vermont. Sanders has also voted to allow firearms on Amtrak trains and in National Parks. ""He wasn't opposed to states having (waiting periods) if they wanted to. The Republicans wanted to repeal waiting periods in states that had them, and Bernie voted that down,"" Sanders aide Jeff Weaver told us at the time. ""He said he would be against waiting periods, and he kept his word to the people of Vermont."" In recent years, Sanders has moved closer to an anti-gun position that is more in line with the norms within the Democratic Party. Sanders has voted in favor of banning assault weapons, closing the gun show loophole, regulating high capacity magazines, and expanding background checks, spokesman Michael Briggs told PolitiFact in 2015. And over the past 15 years, he has received mixed marks from the National Rifle Association, ranging from a C-minus to F. His most recent pro-gun vote came in 2009. Early in the 2016 campaign, Sanders sounded something of a middle-ground message, such as telling CNN’s Jake Tapper in July 2015 that ""we need a sensible debate about gun control which overcomes the cultural divide that exists in this country, and I think I can play an important role in this."" But later in the 2016 campaign, after primary rivals had hit him on his past votes, Sanders sharpened his anti-gun rhetoric and said he would repeal the law he previously voted for that blocks lawsuits against gunmakers. In his current presidential campaign, Sanders has made clear his support for tighter gun restrictions. On the issues page of his campaign website, Sanders promises to expand background checks, ban the sale and distribution of assault weapons, and prohibit high-capacity ammunition magazines, among other policies. Biden said Sanders ""voted against the Brady Bill five times for background checks on people."" Sanders did vote against the Brady bill, including a shifting mix of background check provisions, five times. The most recent of those votes took place 26 years ago. In his 2020 campaign, Sanders is fully supportive of expanded background checks and other gun control policies supported by a wide range of Democratic politicians",Mostly True,"March 9, 2020"
"""Bloomberg says he wants to ban guns holding more than three rounds.""","Mike Bloomberg has made gun control a central pillar of his Democratic campaign for president, including a call for limits on assault weapons. But limiting guns to three rounds? That social media claim is based on vague comments Bloomberg made in 2012 about how to define such weapons. He does not have such a policy in 2020. The headline of one Facebook post, paired with a video commentary, says of the former New York City mayor:  ""Bloomberg says he wants to ban guns holding more than three rounds."" The post resembles comments made in 2013 by Wayne LaPierre, chief executive of the National Rifle Association, on NBC’s Meet the Press. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Two problems:  1. The claim uses the present tense in describing what it refers to as Bloomberg’s proposal, but it cites comments Bloomberg made in a 2012 TV interview. 2. In those comments, which were in response to questions about how to determine which weapons would be subject to restrictions, Bloomberg alluded to limiting the number of rounds a gun could fire quickly. But he didn’t explicitly say he supported a limit of three. Bloomberg has publicly endorsed a ban on ""military-style assault weapons"" and ""high-capacity ammunition magazines,"" such as in a Feb. 11, 2013, letter to lawmakers from Mayors Against Illegal Guns, a coalition Bloomberg co-founded in 2006. The recent Facebook post includes a video with a narrator commenting on excerpts from an ABC News Nightline interview with Bloomberg on Dec. 20, 2012.  The interview referenced the 20 first-graders and six school staffers who were killed by a gunman at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut. In the interview, anchor Cynthia McFadden asked Bloomberg about the challenge of defining an ""assault weapon."" Bloomberg responded by expressing a desire to limit how quickly a gun can fire rounds and the number of rounds a gun can carry. ""Well, if it can fire a lot of bullets very quickly, that's a good place to start, OK, and then you can argue about what a lot is,"" Bloomberg said. McFadden started to interject, and the mayor continued: ""OK, let's pick it. Let's say three. If you haven't hit the deer with three shots, you're a pretty lousy shot. That deer deserves to get away. Let's get serious here."" The Bloomberg campaign didn’t respond to a request for comment. Bloomberg supports reinstating the federal ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines; it banned certain types of semi-automatic firearms along with magazines holding more than 10 rounds of ammunition. Under Bloomberg’s proposal, current assault weapons owners could keep their guns, but would have to report them to federal officials. A Facebook post says: ""Bloomberg says he wants to ban guns holding more than three rounds."" The post is misleading in that Bloomberg made the reference to three rounds in a 2012 interview. And while he suggested restricting the number of rounds that can be fired quickly, and tossed out the idea of three, he didn’t articulate a particular proposal. He also expressed a desire to limit the number of rounds a gun can hold.

"“The majority of hunters now want universal background checks, the majority of Trump voters.”","On the heels of a fiesty Democratic debate that touched on everything from health care to former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg’s past comments and positions, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar joined MSNBC’s ""Morning Joe"" to talk about an issue that didn’t come up: Guns.  Klobuchar said she was ""sad"" that gun violence wasn’t talked about during the debate in Las Vegas, the location of the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history in 2017. She also lamented the lack of progress in Congress on universal background checks. ""The majority of hunters now want universal background checks, the majority of Trump voters,"" Klobuchar said. ""There’s absolutely no reason we shouldn’t be moving on it.""  We’ve fact-checked a number of related claims from Democrats about support for universal background checks among groups such as NRA members, gun owners and Republicans. But what about hunters? And what about supporters of President Donald Trump?  Klobuchar has made the same claim a few times before, including on ABC’s ""The View,"" so we decided to check it out. We found that her statement lines up with the available polls. Many Democrats have called for universal background checks, which would require background checks on nearly all gun purchases, including private sales made at events such as gun shows. The Democrat-led House passed a bill in 2019 to ban the private transfer of firearms unless a licensed gun dealer or manufacturer takes possession of the firearm to conduct a background check. But the GOP-led Senate has refused to take it up. Trump, meanwhile, has made inconsistent statements about background checks, often touting the need to strengthen them in the wake of mass shootings only to walk back his support later. When we examined a previous claim about GOP support for universal background checks, we found a number of polls that showed Republican approval floating between 82% and 95%. Not all registered Republicans necessarily voted or are planning to vote for Trump, whose approval rating within the party has generally held within the mid-to-high 80s. But a few polls that have narrowed the scope to Trump voters lend credence to Klobuchar’s claim. The Klobuchar campaign specifically cited an Aug. 14 Fox News poll that asked 1,013 randomly sampled registered voters if they ""favor or oppose"" proposals ""requiring criminal background checks on all gun buyers, including those buying at gun shows and private sales.""  That poll — conducted shortly after mass shootings in Dayton, Ohio, and El Paso, Texas — found support for such proposals from 90% of ""Trump voters,"" with 8% signaling opposition and 2% saying they didn’t know. Similarly, a mid July Marist poll conducted in partnership with NPR and PBS NewsHour asked 1,346 respondents about ""background checks for gun purchases at gun shows or other private sales."" And 82% of ""2016 Trump supporters"" said the checks were a ""good idea."" Still, it’s worth noting that support for background checks doesn’t always line up with voting for specific pieces of legislation. The National Rifle Association has pointed to 2016 referendums in Maine and Nevada that showed lower support for background checks than the national polls. It’s also not clear how many people surveyed as part of the Fox News and Marist polls identified as Trump voters or supporters, although the Marist poll only reported results for subgroups of at least 100 people. Small sample sizes could be misleading, even if a larger number of polls shows high support for background checks among Republicans more generally.

Membership.politifact.com As for hunters, the Klobuchar campaign cited a 2013 Politico article about a poll commissioned by Bull Moose Sportsmen’s Alliance, an advocacy group representing hunters and sportsmen.  That poll surveyed 800 hunters and found that 77% support ""requiring anyone who wants to purchase a firearm to pass a criminal background check before each potential gun purchase.""  It also found that 72% of hunters support criminal background checks that allow for exemptions for ""gun exchanges between family members, sharing guns on hunting trips and shooting ranges, or sales to those who have concealed carry permits from state government."" By now, the poll is almost seven years old. Liam Sullivan, press secretary for Brady United Against Gun Violence, a gun control advocacy group, said the organization was not aware of any other surveys measuring hunters’ support for background checks.  We couldn’t find other related polls via Google and Nexis. Neither could Everytown for Gun Safety, another gun control advocacy organization. But Sullivan noted that pollsters — including the Pew Research Center  — have found majority support for background checks among gun owners more generally. Klobuchar said, ""The majority of hunters now want universal background checks, the majority of Trump voters.""

“There are more guns in this country than there are citizens.”,"Culpeper Sheriff Scott Jenkins recently told state senators that reinstating Virginia’s one-handgun-a-month purchase limit would not reduce crime. He was speaking before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Jan. 13, a few minutes before the panel approved the limit. Slightly different versions of the legislation have since passed the Senate and the House, largely on party-line votes with Democrats in favor and Republicans opposed. Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat, backs the measure. Jenkins spoke against the bill and made an interesting statistical claim. ""Simply put, there are more guns in this country than there are citizens,"" he said. ""All you’re going to do is continue to drive up the cost for the criminal to purchase the illegal guns. Evil will still be committed."" Are there more guns than people in the United States? The estimates Hard figures on the number of guns in the U.S. are elusive. In the past few years, headlines in the Washington Post and on Vox have declared there are more guns than people in the country. Both noted a surge of gun sales following the 2008 election of President Barack Obama.   But the headlines suggest the figures are certain when they’re not, given that there is no record keeping that would produce an actual count of guns in the United States. As the Pew Research Center has observed, ""Gun ownership is one of the hardest things for researchers to pin down."" At the same time, there have been studies to produce estimates on the number of civilian guns in the nation. Both the Post and Vox noted an estimate on the high end - 310 million guns - that was cited in a 2012 report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. The study said the estimate was based on U.S. Department of Justice data and was the ""total number of firearms available to civilians"" as of 2009. That 310 million count is higher than the U.S. population in 2009 of about 307 million and the citizenship estimate of 285 million, estimated by the U.S. Census Bureau. But one gun-statistics expert, Philip Cook at Duke University, told the Post that the actual figure then was probably closer to 245 million guns, not 310 million, to take into account circumstances such as guns that break down or are lost or destroyed. Cook and two other experts -- Tom Smith at the University of Chicago and Daniel Webster at the Johns Hopkins at the Center for Gun Policy and Research -- have told PolitiFact the best, most recent estimate is in a study published in October 2017 by researchers from the Harvard Injury Control Research Center. A total of 3,949 adults, representative of the U.S. population, were surveyed online. The lead author of the study, Deborah Azrael, says respondents were asked if they owned guns and how many, and told not to count BB guns, replicas or other firearms that were not functioning.  The estimate: 265 million civilian guns in the United States, as of when the survey was taken, in January 2015. The number of U.S. citizens at that time, according to the Census Bureau, was about 299 million. Other highlights of the Harvard study: Of the estimated 265 million total civilian guns, 113 million were handguns. The typical gun owner (the median, in the survey) owned two guns. 39% of the estimated 265 million guns were owned by 8% of the gun owners -- that 8% of all owners owned 10 or more guns. Prior fact checks PolitiFact has previously rated two claims that there are more guns than people in the U.S. That’s similar - but not identical - to Jenkins’ claim that there are more guns than citizens.  One of the claims was made in 2013 by Democrat Eleanor Holmes Norton, the non-voting delegate in the U.S. House of Representatives representing the District of Columbia; the other in 2018 by Kevin Nicholson, an unsuccessful Republican candidate for Congress in Wisconsin",Half True,"February 5, 2020"
"""More than 80% of Republicans think we ought to at least be doing universal background checks.""","Pete Buttigieg is running in the Democratic primary for president, but he said a lot of ""future former Republicans"" are coming to hear his ideas.  ""I am proposing things that most Americans even in conservative states think we ought to do,"" including gun control, Buttigieg said Jan. 26 at a Fox News town hall in Des Moines.  ""More than 80% of Republicans think we ought to at least be doing universal background checks,"" the former South Bend, Ind., mayor said. We’ve fact-checked multiple claims about support for expanding background checks among the general public and NRA members. So what about support for universal background checks among Republicans? Many Democrats running for president have called for universal background checks, which would extend such checks to private sales, including at gun shows. The House in 2019 passed a bill to ban the private transfer of firearms without a background check, but it hasn’t been heard in the Senate. Buttigieg’s campaign pointed to two polls that backed up his point. Both followed the back-to-back mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton in August 2019. While one could argue that such timing could affect the public’s willingness to support stricter measures on guns, we found support was also above 80% before those mass shootings. A Politico/Morning Consult poll in August 2019 found that 90% of Republicans said they would back background checks for all gun sales.  A Washington Post-ABC News poll in September 2019 found that 83% of Republicans support requiring background checks for all potential buyers. We looked at other polls in recent years and found that between 82% and 95% of Republicans stated support for background checks for all buyers. NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist Poll in July 2019 found that 84% of Republicans said it was a good idea to require background checks at gun shows and private sales. Gallup found in 2017 that 95% of Republicans supported background checks for all buyers after the Las Vegas shooting. (Gallup didn’t include the statistic specifically for Republicans in their original press release because there wasn’t a significant difference between parties, but a spokeswoman gave us the information.) Quinnipiac polls between 2013 and 2019 showed that between 86% and 92% of Republicans supported background checks for all buyers. Pew Research Center found in a September 2019 poll that 82% of Republicans favor making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks. The National Rifle Association has pointed to the results of background check referendums in Maine and Nevada in 2016 that showed lower support for background checks than the national polls suggest.  In Maine, 52% rejected a background check measure. In Nevada, a background check question just barely passed with about 50.5% of the vote. Leading up to the election, polls showed higher support for the measures.  The gist of the NRA’s argument is that when people are asked a generic question by a pollster, that leads to a different result than when they actually face a question on a ballot that could affect their own rights. Pew Research Center found in 2013 that support for expanded background checks isn’t necessarily the same as support for specific legislation. Pew’s poll found 81% of Republicans supported expanded background checks, but when asked if they supported a U.S. Senate bill that included such legislation, Republican support dropped to 57%. That still suggests strong support, though by a smaller margin. Some respondents expressed concerns that the bill included restrictions beyond background checks or would lead to a ""slippery slope."" ""People may support background checks in general, but become more skeptical when gun rights groups highlight specific complications or unintended consequences that could arise when these laws are implemented,"" said Kristin Goss, professor of public policy and political science at Duke University. Also, it’s possible that some respondents who say they want background checks for all sales may not realize that it is not current federal law -- a point backed up by a 2013 poll done for the Democratic National Committee. Of the 50% of people who said they preferred enforcement over new laws, 48% said they thought federal law prohibits gun purchases privately or at a gun show without a background check. Another 10% disclosed that they didn’t know the rules. ""Most people don’t have a very good grasp of what our gun laws are,"" Goss said. ""To be fair to Americans, gun laws are complicated and vary greatly state by state."" Buttigieg said, ""More than 80% of Republicans think we ought to at least be doing universal background checks.""  Buttigieg cited two polls that showed Republican support for background checks for all sales at 83% and 90%. We found additional polls in the same ballpark.  The support in polls doesn’t necessarily translate to support for specific legislation or ballot measures, and it’s possible that some respondents are unaware of current laws. That said, there are plenty of polls to back up Buttigieg’s statistic",True,"January 29, 2020"
"Says Jordan Davis, son of Georgia Congresswoman Lucy McBath, was killed in ""a drug deal gone bad.""","U.S. Rep. Lucy McBath, D-Ga., became a gun control advocate after her teenage son was murdered. On Jan. 20, the day 22,000 people rallied for gun rights in Richmond, Va., a Republican from her home state attacked her policies in a Facebook post. The post, repeated on Twitter, was made by Paul Maner, who ran in 2016 for the Republican nomination for a Georgia state Senate seat.  The post includes a video related to the Richmond rally and says:  ""THIS is what the lunatics like Lucy McBath for Congress Rep. Lucy McBath are all about. ""#TakeBack6th ""If her son hadn't been involved with a drug deal gone bad, her son might still be alive today. Her solution, to disarm everyone who is a law abiding citizen."" The claim about her son is wrong.  McBath called it ""pathetic"" and used Maner’s Twitter post to try to raise donations for her campaign. Chelsea Clinton, the daughter of Bill and Hillary Clinton, called the attack vile and hateful, and urged her Twitter followers to support McBath. We messaged Maner on Facebook, asking for information to back his claim, but did not get a response. The Atlanta Journal Constitution describes him as a Georgia Republican activist. The facts of McBath’s son’s death at the hands of Michael Dunn are clear and have been reported many times by local and national news media. It became known as the ""loud music"" case. Drugs were not involved. From a CBS News story on Dunn’s sentencing in October 2014: Dunn encountered four black teens — including McBath’s son, Jordan Davis, 17  — on the evening of Nov. 23, 2012, when Dunn and his girlfriend pulled up next to their SUV in the parking lot of a convenience store in Jacksonville, Fla.  Dunn asked the teens to turn down the music in their car. Davis took issue with his request. The two exchanged heated words as Davis sat in the back seat of the SUV. Dunn argued that he thought he saw the barrel of a gun inside the car and was in fear for his life when he shot up the SUV. The prosecution said that the threat Dunn, a white man, perceived from the group of black teens was ""only in his imagination."" The teens were unarmed. Dunn fired 10 shots in three short bursts, striking Davis three times.  At the sentencing, Dunn then 47, made a short statement addressed to Davis' family: ""I truly regret what happened... if I could roll back time and do things differently I would. Still, I'm mortified I took a life."" We looked through multiple news stories about the case. None tied the shooting to a potential drug deal. Dunn was sentenced to life in prison without parole. Maner said Davis, the son of a member of Congress, was killed in ""a drug deal gone bad."" Davis was among four black teens in a car who got in a dispute with a middle-aged white man who wanted them to turn down their music.

"The State Capitol Police ""recommended"" banning guns at the Capitol.","In imposing a gun ban at the State Capitol, newly-empowered House Democrats repeatedly said they were acting on the recommendation of Capitol Police. Pro-gun Republicans angrily accused the Democrats of deceit. It all happened during Jan. 10 at the meetings of two committees that set the rules for the State Capitol, and sounded the opening shots of a Democratic effort to toughen Virginia’s gun laws. Calling for gun control in last fall’s elections, Democrats won majorities in the House and Senate for the first time this century. Working with Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam, they have introduced bills that would establish universal background checks on firearm buyers, an assault weapons ban, a one-handgun-a-month purchase limit, and a red-flag law that would allow authorities to temporarily take guns from people deemed a threat to themselves or others. In response, more than 100 localities have declared themselves ""Second Amendment Sanctuaries""  that won’t enforce gun restrictions they think are unconstitutional. Thousands of gun advocates are expected to rally at the Capitol on Jan. 20, prompting public safety concerns. The gun ban was passed on a party-line vote by the Joint Rules Committee, a panel of Senate and House leaders, whose decisions are not reviewed by the full legislature. It applies to visitors of the Pocahontas Building, where lawmakers have offices and committee rooms. In the past, anyone with a valid concealed-handgun permit was allowed to bring a gun into the Capitol. Democrats said four times during the meeting that the Capitol Police recommended the new policy. Del. Marcus Simon, D-Fairfax: ""This is all done, really, at the recommendation of the Capitol Police, who I think are going to speak to these measures themselves. This is the advice we’ve gotten from the security professionals on what they need to do their jobs effectively and keep us all safe going forward throughout this session and sessions of the future."" House Majority Leader Charniele Herring, D-Alexandria:  ""I just have to say that this is something that has been recommended by our Capitol Police, and I think there are times when we sort of have to trust what our law enforcement officers our telling us in concern for our safety and the safety of others coming into this building."" Herring: ""This is a recommendation for our Capitol Police who we trust every day and who have kept us safe and I trust their judgment."" Speaker Eileen Filler-Corn, D-Fairfax: ""Again, this is being recommended by Col. Pike and the professionals and that’s why we’re moving in this direction."" She was referring to Capitol Police Col. Anthony Pike. After the meeting, Pike qualified the Democrats’ statements. He told reporters neither he nor his agency recommended the gun ban. They simply complied with a Democratic request to figure how such a plan would be put in effect. ""When (Democrats) approached me and indicated they were going  to put in a firearms prohibition, that’s when they asked me for my input on how we would process, how we would handle these facilities with that prohibition,"" he said. Pike declined to say if the thought the gun ban is a good idea, saying the Capitol Police is non-political and implements legislative rules. Later, in a meeting of the House Rules Committee, Pike again emphasized that the Capitol Police strives to avoid politics and didn’t call for the ban.  ""I was told that there was going to be a prohibition on firearms and to put together my recommendations on how to handle that prohibition for the buildings,"" he said under questioning from Republicans. House Minority Leader Leader Todd Gilbert, R-Shenanhoah, chastised the Democrats, saying, ""I just think that entire effort to put this on the Capitol Police was disgusting."" Former Speaker Kirk Cox, R-Colonial Heights, told Filler-Corn, ""Let’s be honest with each other...That was a deliberate misrepresentation. There’s no way around that."" Filler-Corn later accused Republicans of trying to divert attention on the gun control debate. Our ruling House Democratic leaders (Filler-Corn, Herring and Simon) said four times they were imposing a gun ban at the Capitol at the ""recommendation"" of the Capitol Police. But Pike, the chief of the Capitol Police, says the Democrats had decided among themselves there would be a gun ban and approached him afterwards to work out the details. He declined to tell reporters if he thinks thinks the ban is a good idea, citing the nonpartisan nature of his agency and its role to enforce legislative rules.  Democrats have not disputed Pike’s account",False,"January 15, 2020"

That’s the claim of a 20-paragraph post on Facebook that has been shared more than 21,000 times.  The post argues that America is safe from invasion because of gun-owning hunters. It starts its historical claim by stating: ""After the Japanese decimated our fleet in Pearl Harbor Dec 7, 1941, they could have sent their troop ships and carriers directly to California to finish what they started. The prediction from our Chief of Staff was we would not be able to stop a massive invasion until they reached the Mississippi River. Remember, we had a 2 million man army and war ships in other localities, so why did they not invade? After the war, the remaining Japanese generals and admirals were asked that question. Their answer....they know that almost every home had guns and the Americans knew how to use them."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It’s not a new claim. In a video posted in 2012, Ed Emery, a Repubican state senator from Missouri, claimed that it is known that Japan was deterred not by America’s armed services but because ""every American was armed."" The surprise aerial attack on the U.S. naval base at Pearl Harbor on Oahu Island, Hawaii, climaxed a decade of worsening relations between the United States and Japan, and precipitated the entry of the United States into World War II, as Encyclopedia Britannica puts it. But the success didn’t mean Japan was poised to march into California. ""The Japanese didn't plan to invade the U.S., never considered it seriously and knew they couldn't succeed,"" said Jonathan Dresner, a history professor at Pittsburg State University in Kansas whose specialties include Japanese history.  When Japan lost its main aircraft carriers in the Battle of Midway seven months after Pearl Harbor, any thought of a mainland invasion ""was doomed and abandoned,"" Fred Notehelfer told us.  ""Certainly the Japanese were not constrained by the notion that some Americans had guns in their homes — no one had AK-47s and other assault weapons at the time,"" added Notehelfer, an emeritus professor of history at UCLA who specializes in the history of Japan. Professor James Holmes, chair of maritime strategy and at the U.S. Naval War College in Rhode Island, told us it’s plausible that private gun ownership was part of Japan’s calculus, but not the dominant factor. ""I seriously doubt anyone in Tokyo countenanced an invasion of the continental United States apart, perhaps, from raids on the West Coast. There is only so much a small island state in Asia can do, no matter how skilled its armed forces,"" he said. ""Geographic space, logistics, other commitments—these considerations would have outweighed any concerns about an armed American populace."" Ian Toll, author of ""The Conquering Tide: War in the Pacific Islands, 1942-1944"" and ""Pacific Crucible: War at Sea in the Pacific, 1941-1942,"" told us that regarding an invasion, the Japanese ""had plans on a shelf, but never seriously considered putting them into action,"" and that ""I’ve never come across anything to suggest that gun ownership was a factor in Japan’s decision."" ""In June 1942, some Americans were concerned the Japanese would advance into Alaska and then through Canada to the northwest,"" he said. ""But the scale of the operation was simply beyond their national capabilities, measured by troop numbers, naval power, or shipping."" Promoters of the guns deterring an invasion theory also point to this quote attributed to Japanese Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto:  ""You cannot invade mainland United States. There would be a rifle behind each blade of grass."" But the quote is ""unsubstantiated and almost certainly bogus, even though it has been repeated thousands of times in various Internet postings,"" FactCheck.org reported.  Toll told us: ""It is true that Yamamoto told others in the Japanese government and military that invading North America was unrealistic, but I know of no source that has him citing gun ownership as a factor.""

"Says after Australia passed a ""new law"" that forced gun owners to give up over 640,000 firearms, the country saw a dramatic increase in homicides, assaults and robberies.","A photograph that shows a truck unloading a heap of firearms has been shared thousands of times on Facebook. The image is usually displayed alongside text that claims Australia passed a ""new law"" that forced gun owners to surrender 640,381 firearms and that, one year later, statistics show a national surge in violent crimes such as homicides, assaults and robberies. This chain message has been going around the internet since at least 2009.  The statistics didn’t add up then and still don’t today.  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The photograph itself is real and was taken in Australia, but it’s from the late 1990s. We tracked it down using a reverse-image search and found it was taken by photographer David Gray on July 29, 1997.  The caption says the truck was unloading prohibited firearms at a Sydney scrap-metal yard and that they were later destroyed: ""The guns were handed in over the past month under the Australian government's buy-back scheme. A total of 470,000 guns have been collected nationally, with owners receiving a $243 million (US $180 million) in compensation."" The caption continues to explain that the buyback program was set up due to tighter gun laws enacted after the April 1996 Port Arthur massacre, when a gunman opened fire in a cafe in Tasmania, killing 35 people in the worst mass murder in Australia’s history. The Australian government thereafter in 1996 passed the National Firearms Agreement in response to the shooting. The measure outlawed automatic and semi-automatic rifles, as well as pump-action shotguns, and instituted the buyback program, which was funded by a tax levy that raised about $500 million. As a result, approximately 640,000 weapons were turned over to the government and firearm owners were paid around $304 million, according to a 1997 report by the Australian National Audit Office. So, the post is correct that 640,000 weapons were handed over to the government. But this happened nearly 25 years ago as part of a buyback program and those participating received financial compensation. More importantly, though, the post is wrong in its claim that the measure resulted in more violent crime in the country.  The post inaccurately says that one year after the buyback, homicides went up 6.2%, assaults went up 9.6% and armed robberies went up 44%. It also says that, in the state of Victoria, homicides with firearms increased 300%. What really happened is homicides declined about 9% to 333 in 1998 compared with a year prior, according to the Australian Institute of Criminology.   There were 132,297 victims of assault in Australia – a 6% increase from 1997 (not 9.6% as the post states), the organization says. Assaults had been on the rise for years. The Australian Bureau of Statistics reported that armed robberies increased by 20% (not 44%), but the number involving firearms decreased to a six-year low of 19%. If we interpret the post to be referring to today’s numbers, it’s still wrong.  The rates of various types of violent crime (excluding sexual assault) has, depending on the crime, stayed the same or declined over the last several years. To summarize our findings, Australia instituted a buyback program in the late 1990s after passing stricter gun legislation, which resulted in more than 640,000 firearms being turned into the government. Meanwhile, the rates of violent crimes did not and have not dramatically increased, as the post suggests",False,"January 13, 2020"
"U.S. and Virginia murders are ""usually gangbangers killing gangbangers.""","A leading gun rights activist says Democratic lawmakers are trying to penalize law-abiding firearm owners for violence committed by gangs. The charge was made by Philip Van Cleave, president of the Virginia Citizens Defense League, during a Dec. 9 rally at the state Capitol. His group was protesting a series of gun restrictions proposed by Democrats, who in November elections, won control of both General Assembly chambers for the first time this century. Working with Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam, the new majority is calling for universal background checks on firearm buyers, an assault weapons ban, a one-handgun-a-month purchase limit, and a red-flag law that would allow authorities to temporarily take guns from people deemed a threat to themselves or others. With urging from Van Cleaves’ group and other pro-gun interests, more than 100 localities have declared themselves ""Second Amendment Sanctuaries""  that won’t enforce gun restrictions they think are unconstitutional. Van Cleave, in a speech at the rally, said Democrats should focus on stopping crime instead of restricting guns. He blamed gun violence mostly on gangs.  ""Let’s fix crime,"" he said. ""You know what? If you took an X-Acto pen to certain parts of every city in the state and around the country; if you cut it out and could take it off the map, murders would drop to almost zero. It’s usually gangbangers killing gangbangers."" We fact-checked his claim that homicides in Virginia and across the nation usually involve gang members killing one another. Our search for national statistics kept sending us to discontinued data once compiled by the National Gang Center under the Department of Justice.  Based on annual surveys of local law enforcement agencies, the Center tallied 11,934 ""gang-related"" homicides in the U.S. from 2007 through 2012. The FBI reported 93,253 total murders during the span. Comparing the numbers, the Center estimated that ""gang-related homicides typically accounted for around 13% of all homicides annually."" That’s far below Van Cleave’s claim that most murders are gang-related. But the Center had concerns about the reliability of its gang-related homicide numbers and stopped collecting them after 2012. It put an asterisk on top of its chart with the note urging ""caution"" in interpreting the results. In footnotes, the Center explained that localities had different ways of defining the term ""gang-related."" The Center tallied 1,975 gang-related murders in 2007, and 2,363 in 2012 - a 24% increase. ""The occurrence of gang homicides was highly concentrated in very large cities, with a small subset of these cities accounting for most of the increase over previous years,"" it wrote in footnotes. We asked Van Cleave where he got his information that most murders, nationally and in Virginia are ""gangbangers killing gangbangers."" He didn’t provide a specific answer. Van Cleave noted there are high murder rates in some cities where gangs are prevelant. He urged us to call the state medical examiner’s office for data on Virginia. Maria Reppas, communications director of the state Department of Health - which oversees the chief medical examiner - said the department doesn’t collect data on gang-related murders. The State Police don’t keep such records, either, according to Corinne Geller, the agency’s public relations director. Nor does the Virginia State Crime Commission, said Kristen Howard, executive director of the study group. They said they were unaware of any state statistics on gang-related murders. In opposing gun control measures, Van Cleave says murders in the U.S. and Virginia are ""usually gangbangers killing gangbangers.""  Our search turned up only one set of statistics, and it casts doubt on Van Cleave’s statement. The National Gang Center estimated that from 2007 through 2012, 13% of U.S. homicides were gang-related. But it stopped collecting the data after that, noting that police departments around the nation were submitting counts based on varying definitions of ""gang-related.""  We couldn’t find any statistics on gang-related murders in Virginia. The State Police, the Crime Commission, and the Department of Health (to which Van Cleave indirectly referred us) said they don’t keep such records and did not know where they might exist.

The graphic with the question and emoji was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The question’s underlying facts are flawed. There is no national registry of all people here illegally, and most states do not require gun owners to register their weapons. Immigrants in the country illegally generally have either overstayed the length of a visa or come into the country without authorization and proper documentation. The federal government has immigration records of people issued a deportation order or released from immigration custody pending a final resolution of their case. But there isn’t a database listing everyone who is in the country illegally. Gun owners don’t have to catalog their firearms in a national register, and the majority of states don’t require firearm registration. Some states even have laws to prohibit gun registries, according to the National Rifle Association, or NRA. However, six states — California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maryland, New Jersey, and New York — require the registration of certain firearms, such as assault weapons, according to the Giffords Law Center, which favors laws requiring gun registration. Hawaii and the District of Columbia require the registration of all firearms; and while California does not have a traditional gun registry, it has a similarly functioning system, the Giffords Law Center said. The Facebook post in its question form implies that guns are required to be registered, but that’s not the case nationally. Only a few states require the registration of some or all firearms.

"A state senate bill would ""criminalize a father teaching his own son how to use a hunting rifle.""","A prolific conspiracy theorist is sounding a ""TYRANNY ALERT"" about a bill introduced in the state Senate that he claims would ban firearms training and martial arts instruction in Virginia. ""It would even criminalize a father teaching his own son how to use a hunting rifle,"" wrote Mike Adams in a Nov. 27, 2019 post on NewsTarget, one of several websites he operates that are anti-vaccine, critical of science, and promote guns and survivalism.  Adams is based in Cody,  Wyo. In June 2019, Facebook revoked an Adams’ page promoting alternative medicine for violating spam rules. The page, called NaturalNews, reportedly had 2.9 million Facebook likes. Adam’s recent post on Virginia centers on a bill recently introduced by state Sen. Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, that would add restrictions to Virginia’s paramilitary activities laws. Passed in 1987, the laws make it a felony to assemble - or teach how to assemble - guns, explosives or incendiary devices with the intention of abetting civil disorder. Violators face a maximum 10 years in prison and $2,500 fine. Lucas’ bill would also make it a felony for people to gather ""with the intent of intimidating any person or group of persons by drilling, parading, or marching with any firearm, any explosive or incendiary device, or any components or combination thereof."" It comes after the August 2017 white supremicist rally in Charlottesville that left one counterprotestor dead and others injured.  Adams wrote that the bill, in addition to banning a father from teaching his son how to hunt with a rifle, ""would also criminalize all firearms training classes, including concealed carry classes."" He added, ""The law would instantly transform all martial arts instructors into criminal felons.""   In fact, the legislation would do none of these things. Lucas’ bill, as we noted, adds to the list of illegal acts and Virginia’s paramilitary laws. But it leaves intact the next section of the code, which which exempts from paramilitary laws: *""Any activity, undertaken without knowledge of or intent to cause or further a civil disorder, which is intended to teach or practice self defense or self-defense techniques such as karate clubs..."" *""Lawful activities related to firearms instruction or training intended to teach the safe handling and use of firearms.""  *""Lawful sports or activities related to the individual recreational use or possession of firearms."" We tried to contact Adams, but received no reply to three emails sent to an address on one of his websites for media inquiries. A person answereing the phone in Adams' media relations office, who didn’t give her name, told us ""there probably won’t be a response."" It should be noted that Lucas introduced identical bills in each of the last two years that were killed in Republican-controlled Senate committees. GOP senators voiced concern that the bill would be hard to enforce and might violate citizens’ constitutional right to assemble. Videos of the hearings show no one raising concerns that the bill would affect firearms training or self-defense instruction. The bill may face better prospects this year, with Democrats controlling both chambers of the General Assembly for the first time this century. Attorney General Mark Herring, a Democrat, has endorsed the legislation. Our ruling Adams wrote that a bill in the General Assembly ""would criminalize a father teaching his own son how to use a hunting rifle."" That’s flat out wrong. The bill would add a clause to the state’s paramilitary laws making it a felony for groups to train or march with weapons with ""the intent of intimidating others."" The bill, however, does not change a code section that exempts from the paramilitary act ""lawful activities related to firearms instruction."" Another ridiculous Adams’ claim: The bill ""would instantly transform all martial arts instructors into criminal felons.""

"On red-flag laws says, ""What (Democrats) wanted to do was say, ‘I think you might do something, so I’m going to take away your gun and make you prove you wouldn’t do it.""","Wisconsin state Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester, has a new take on how red-flag gun laws work. Generally speaking, the laws allow judges to temporarily take guns away from people who are deemed to be a danger to themselves or others. Republicans and Democrats in the state Legislature have been widely divided on a bill that would create such a law in Wisconsin. Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, called the Legislature into special session to consider a red-flag law proposal and a separate measure expanding background checks to cover all gun sales, but the GOP quickly adjourned the session without taking action on either. In a Nov. 10, 2019 appearance on WISN-TV’s UpFront, Vos told host Adrienne Pedersen:  ""What (Democrats) wanted to do was say, ‘I think you might do something so I’m going to take away your gun and make you prove you wouldn’t do it.’ ""  In other words, the claim is the proposed law would allow a gun to be taken away, and then put the burden of proof on the gun owner to show they are not a threat in order to get the gun back. But that’s counter to one of the basic foundations of the U.S. legal system.  It would be akin to saying someone charged with a crime has to prove their innocence -- not that a prosecutor has to convince a judge or jury of the defendant’s guilt.  Is Vos right? Let’s dig in. Defense misses the mark Asked for backup, Vos spokeswoman Kit Beyer pointed to the language of the proposed bill that says once an injunction is issued, a judge can vacate it ""if the respondent demonstrates, by clear and convincing evidence, that the respondent is no longer substantially likely to injure the respondent or another person if the respondent possesses a firearm."" The language is accurate, but Vos is misapplying it. He argues this standard applies to the process from the beginning, when the language actually refers to a step later in the process, when a gun owner can ask the judge to reconsider the original decision. Joseph Blocher, a law professor at Duke University, said the burden of proof is always with the petitioner when it comes to seeking red-flag seizures.  ""What that burden is -- ‘clear and convincing’ or ‘preponderance of the evidence’ -- varies state by state and depending on whether it’s a temporary ex parte order or a final order,"" Blocher told PolitiFact Wisconsin. ""But in all cases, a judge has to be persuaded of the risk.""  Indeed, the proposal from Evers would allow guns to be seized if a judge finds ""reasonable grounds that the respondent is substantially likely"" to harm themselves or others. How would it work? The process varies a bit state-to-state, but always begins with a petition to a court that argues an individual is a danger to himself (or herself) or others. Such a petition typically comes from law enforcement officials, but may also come from family members or friends. Under Evers’ proposal, a judge or court commissioner would hear the request and then decide whether to issue a preliminary order without first having to notify or hear from the gun owner. A temporary order is then put in place for up to 14 days.  So, there would be a short period where a gun could be taken before an owner has a say, but with the burden placed on the other party. A judge would then schedule a second hearing to make a final determination. The gun owner would have a chance to be present for this hearing. This is where whomever filed the original petition would make their case. The burden would be on them to convince the judge the gun owner was a danger. The final order would be valid for up to one year, though requests could be made to extend it. Additionally, the gun owner could ask the court for an early end to the order This is the step the language Vos cited actually refers to. It is then -- when a gun owner is seeking an early end to an order -- that the burden of proof would fall on the gun owner. Laws are relatively new The first red-flag law was put in place in Connecticut in 1990, but it wasn’t until 2005 that the second law was approved in Indiana. Following the February 2018 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., many other states passed similar laws. Now, at least 17 states and Washington D.C. have a red-flag law in place.  Each state allows law enforcement to seek the removal of guns, while 12 states also allow family or household members to do so.  A handful of states also allow petitions from medical professionals, colleagues or school officials, according to Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, a research and gun control advocacy organization.  There are already several spots in Wisconsin law that relate to when guns can be taken. Under current law, a person is prohibited from having guns or must surrender their firearms if they’re ""subject to a domestic abuse injunction, a child abuse injunction, or, in certain cases, a harassment or an individuals-at-risk injunction."" If the person surrenders a firearm because of one of those convictions, the firearm can’t be returned to them until a court determines that the injunction has been vacated or has expired, according to a November 2019 analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau. The law also says people must surrender their firearms as a result of certain proceedings, such as mental health commitments and restraining orders.  Our rating Vos said of red-flag laws: ""What they wanted to do was say I think you might do something so I’m going to take away your gun and make you prove you wouldn’t do it."" The laws in effect now, and the proposal in Wisconsin, would allow guns to be taken away temporarily, until a full court hearing is held. However, Vos is far off when it comes to where the burden of proof falls when a judge is considering a seizure request.  Experts say it would fall on the person seeking the seizure  -- not the gun owner",Mostly False,"December 6, 2019"
"Says 1,000 people failed gun background checks in Wisconsin in 2018, but ""almost none of them were prosecuted for trying to do a background check and illegally buy a weapon.""","Wisconsin’s top elected leaders have filled a lot of airtime and newsprint disagreeing on whether to expand background checks for gun buyers. But what about the people who already fail background checks? The Wisconsin Department of Justice conducts background checks on every person attempting to buy a handgun from a gun dealer in the state. Not everyone passes. Assembly Speaker Robin Vos raised that issue while objecting to Gov. Tony Evers’ push for a red flag law in Wisconsin. He said the state should focus on ""enforcing the laws that are already on the books"" rather than pursuing legislation the parties don’t agree on. His claim: ""Let’s remember that in 2018 we had I think it was 132,000 background checks. About 1,000 of those failed,"" Vos, R-Rochester, said in a Nov. 10, 2019, appearance on WISN-TV’s UpFront program. ""For the 1,000 that failed, almost none of them were prosecuted for trying to do a background check and illegally buy a weapon."" This fact check takes us beyond the numbers into prosecutorial discretion, the ignorance defense and more. Let’s get started. Evers is pushing to extend background checks to sales between private parties, also known as  universal background checks. Wisconsin is one of 29 states that currently don’t get involved in private sales. For purchases from licensed dealers, Wisconsin splits the background check responsibilities based on the type of gun. The FBI handles checks on long gun sales, while the Wisconsin Department of Justice does checks for handgun purchases. RELATED: Do red flag laws allow gun seizure without a judge’s OK? RELATED: Sen. Scott Fitzgerald misfires with claim on gun background checks and Second Amendment RELATED: Can you buy a gun in Wisconsin after a felony or restraining order? Anyone seeking to buy a handgun must fill out a DOJ form that asks a series of questions about disqualifying past conduct. They must say, for example, if they’ve been convicted of a felony, found not guilty of a felony in Wisconsin by reason of mental disease, been convicted of a juvenile offense that would be a felony if they were an adult, or are under a court order or injunction that would ban them from possessing a gun. The number of people failing background checks once DOJ processes that form roughly matches Vos’ claim. In fiscal year 2019 (July 2018 to June 2019), the DOJ processed 133,452 background checks, and 1,306 of those were denied, said DOJ spokeswoman Gillian Drummond. That’s consistent with fiscal 2018, when the DOJ processed 135,265 background checks and denied 1,202 of them, according to the Legislative Fiscal Bureau. State statute says the DOJ ""may"" report these denials to local authorities for investigation. But Drummond said DOJ treats that as a requirement and ""alerts local law enforcement for potential investigations."" So Vos is right on the numbers, but what happens when failed background checks are passed on to local police for investigation? The core of Vos’ claim — that ""almost none"" of those denials are prosecuted — is trickier. For starters, the Justice Department doesn’t track which of their tips lead to prosecution. Beyond that, not every failed background check is a crime. The person has to know they’re banned from owning a gun. ""The attempt to purchase a firearm by a person not allowed under state or federal law to have a firearm is only illegal if the individual knows they are disqualified from the purchase,"" Drummond said. ""For example, if a person has a misdemeanor in another state, which is a felony under Wisconsin law, the person would be disqualified but may not know that prior to attempted purchase. Or a person who has admitted to a law enforcement officer that they’ve used an illegal substance is also disqualified even if they were not arrested."" So it is a valid defense in this case to plead ignorance. Let’s move on to what we do know about prosecuting these cases. Vos’ evidence for the claim, as passed on by his office, is built around charges for a crime specific to the background check form. Wisconsin statute 175.35(3)(b)(1) makes it a misdemeanor punishable by up to nine months in jail to provide false information on the background check form.  Those charges are indeed rare. A PolitiFact Wisconsin analysis of Wisconsin court records shows only 23 people were charged with giving false information on the gun purchase form from 2007 to 2018. In other words, we had about two per year over the last decade while DOJ rejects about 1,000 background checks per year. But that’s not the only charge that could result from trying to buy a gun illegally, prosecutors say. Michael Graveley, the Kenosha County district attorney, said a felon who handles even an unloaded gun is guilty of being a felon in possession of a firearm. So prosecutors could ignore the misdemeanor related to the background check form and charge the more serious felony related to gun possession. That was the case in 2016 when Chad A. Fletcher, 44, of Kenosha, applied to purchase a gun through the Kenosha Gander Mountain. He failed his background check through DOJ, but local police investigating the DOJ tip also found video footage of him handling the gun in the store. Fletcher was initially charged with possession of a firearm by a felon but not the background check offense. However, he reached a plea deal that later reduced the felony to a misdemeanor charge of providing false information on a background check. In short, prosecutors aren’t required to file that charge just because it applies — and they don’t always. ""There might be times it applies and prosecutors don’t issue it because they want something else,"" said Sheboygan County District Attorney Joel Urmanski. That something else in a background check case would typically be the felon in possession of a firearm charge. But that charge doesn’t shed much light on our question since the vast majority are related to circumstances outside the background check process. For the record, there were 10,000 such charges over the last decade. We can’t detail how many of those are connected to background checks without pulling records on each case. But the prosecutors we spoke to from several high-population counties weren’t aware of any significant volume of charges resulting from background checks. We should also note that a nationwide 2018 study found it wouldn’t be unusual for background checks in Wisconsin to rarely spur criminal charges. The analysis found only 12 prosecutions in fiscal 2017 in the 29 states where federal officials handle background checks. In 13 states that handle their own checks, 10 do not investigate or prosecute firearm denials at all. Vos said ""almost none"" of the 1,000 or so people failing a background check each in year in Wisconsin are prosecuted. It’s a lot more complicated claim than it might seem. Indeed, on average only about two people per year are charged specifically with the crime of providing false information on a background check. Prosecutors say violators can also be charged with the more serious crime of being a felon in possession of a firearm — or attempting to do so. But anecdotally we found no evidence that this happens frequently. And, of course, failing a background check is only a crime if the applicant knew they were banned from having a gun. Add it all together and we get a statement that appears to be accurate, but it needs some additional information and clarification",Mostly True,"November 26, 2019"

"""People with pre-existing mental health conditions have access to firearms and not health care.""","A recent Facebook post with a hashtag indicating support for U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders’ presidential bid argued this point in favor of the candidate’s signature healthcare plan, Medicare for All: ""Just so we’re clear: people with pre-existing mental health conditions have access to firearms and not healthcare.""  This post, which has been shared more than 58,000 times since it was published on Aug. 4, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  First, let’s look at whether people with pre-existing mental health conditions can access guns.  Federal law prohibits the purchase and possession of firearms by people with felony convictions, domestic abusers, and people with specific kinds of mental health histories. The Gun Control Act prohibits transferring a gun to a person who ""has been adjudicated as a mental defective or committed to a mental institution,"" according to the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics. Such people are also prohibited from possessing a gun.  The Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence — which advocates for a more comprehensive system for reporting mental illness and conducting background checks — states on its website that while such checks have blocked more than 3 million people in those categories from getting firearms, federal gun law generally doesn’t affect other people who public health researchers have identified as having a higher risk of being dangerous, including other people who have suffered from severe mental illness.   ""The system intended to limit access to firearms for individuals experiencing a mental health crisis still includes dangerous loopholes,"" the center says. The law center also points to a 2012 Mother Jones story. It reported that among 62 people accused in mass shootings in recent years, 38 ""displayed signs of possible mental health problems prior to the killings."" Nearly 80 percent of the perpetrators obtained their weapons legally, according to the publication.  In 2016, the New York Times detailed how people with mental illness are able to get guns. They can buy them from private sellers because federal law doesn’t require background checks for such transactions. Or, they fall under a broader category of mental illness and skirt the restrictions federal law has for people who have been involuntarily committed to a mental hospital or deemed a ""mental defective"" by a court or other authority. Plus, mental health records are ""overwhelmingly under-reported to federal and state databases scanned during a background check,"" the story says. So while federal law prohibits people with certain kinds of mental health histories from owning a gun, there are gaps that leave room for people with severe mental illness to buy guns.  Next, let’s look at whether people with pre-existing mental health conditions can’t access health care.  The Affordable Care Act requires health plans in individual and small group markets to cover 10 essential benefits. Among them: mental health and substance use disorder services including behavioral health treatment like counseling and psychotherapy.  ""Pre-existing mental and behavioral health conditions are covered, and spending limits aren’t allowed,"" reads a page on healthcare.gov covering mental health and substance abuse coverage. ""Marketplace plans can’t deny you coverage or charge you more just because you have any pre-existing condition, including mental health and substance use disorder conditions.""  Other health plans characterized as ""short-term, limited duration insurance"" — often purchased to fill in coverage gaps such as when a person is between jobs — are not required to include Obamacare’s essential benefits and can exclude pre-existing conditions from coverage or reject people entirely. The Obama administration limited these policies to just three months and regulated them so they couldn’t be renewed, NPR reported in October, but the Trump Administration has changed that; in some states, people can buy such policies that last a year and can renew them twice.  The National Alliance on Mental Illness has decried these short-term plans, saying they discriminate against mental illness. But they’re not sold on the health insurance marketplace and people can’t use federal subsidies to help pay for them. For very healthy people, these plans can be cheaper than what’s available on healthcare.gov, said Linda Blumberg an institute fellow at Health Policy Center at the Urban Institute, but it’s a small segment of the overall insured population.  Job-based coverage from large employers — meaning those with more than 50 employees -— could also limit mental health coverage, Blumberg said. But since the passage of federal mental health parity laws and the Affordable Care Act, plans that offer mental health benefits must do so in a way comparable to the other medical services they cover. Today, there are still problems with accessing mental health care, Blumberg said. Some areas have a shortage of providers, for example, or providers who aren’t covered by certain insurance plans. Plus, if the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals sustains a lower court’s decision to overturn the Affordable Care Act, she said, this Facebook post could be more meaningful.  But with the exception of short-term plans, Blumberg said the claim that people with pre-existing mental health conditions don’t have access to health care isn’t correct.  Our ruling The Facebook post says people with pre-existing mental health conditions have access to firearms and not health care. There are gaps in both gun control and health care systems. But the post leaves a misleading impression that anyone with pre-existing mental health conditions can’t get health care coverage when, in reality, it’s only a slice of all health insurance plans that don’t have to comply with federal rules about pre-existing conditions",Half True,"November 7, 2019"
"Says ""red flag laws"" allow gun seizure without a judge’s involvement: ""They take it away first. Then you have to get permission from a judge to do it.""","The partisan divide over gun control in Wisconsin is as stark as it has ever been. Frustrated by a lack of Republican action on the topic, Gov. Tony Evers has called a special session of the state Legislature. He wanted lawmakers to take up a so-called ""red flag"" law — which would allow judges to take guns away from people who are deemed to be a danger — and an expansion of gun background checks to include sales between private parties. Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald promptly announced he would likely adjourn the session as soon as it began, refusing to even vote on the proposals. Meanwhile, the state Legislature’s other lead Republican — Assembly Speaker Robin Vos — has been making the media rounds to defend Republican inaction and condemn Evers’ proposals. That included a Facebook Live interview with WTJM-TV’s Charles Benson on Oct. 22, 2019. Their conversation turned to red flag laws, also referred to as emergency risk protection orders. Here’s part of that exchange: Vos — Red flags laws, it’s basically like saying we are going to take away your car because we think you could drive drunk. It’s crazy. Benson — But a judge has to decide that. Vos — No, they take away your weapon first, then you have to go and ask permission to get the weapon back. Vos later reiterated his description while criticizing how the Marquette University Law School poll summarized red flag laws as ""allowing the police to take guns away from people who have been found by a judge to be a danger to themselves or others."" In late August, the poll showed 81% of respondents in support. ""That’s not the way the red flag law works,"" said Vos, R-Rochester. ""They take it away first. Then you have to get permission from a judge to do it."" Is Vos right that red flag laws allow guns to be seized before a judge gets involved? Let’s dig in. Red flag laws provide a mechanism to take guns from people exhibiting dangerous behavior before they harm themselves or others. The first such law was passed in Connecticut in 1990, but the second didn’t appear until Indiana’s in 2005. More states have adopted such laws in recent years in the wake of mass shootings by people who had exhibited earlier warning signs. At least 17 states and the District of Columbia now have a red flag law, including several passed in 2019, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, a research and advocacy organization. Every state allows law enforcement to seek the removal of guns, 12  allow family or household members to as well, and a smattering of states also allow petitions from medical professionals, co-workers or school officials. Typically, a judge (or other judicial official such as a court commissioner) hears the request and then decides whether to issue a preliminary order without holding a hearing or notifying the gun owner. These orders are temporary and last from two to 21 days depending on the state, according to an issue brief put together by the nonpartisan Wisconsin Legislative Council. The gun owner then has a chance to make his or her case at a hearing before a judge decides on a final order. That order commonly lasts for a year. Different states have different burdens of proof that must be met for a judge to issue an order, such as finding the individual poses a ""significant risk"" or that there is ""clear and convincing evidence."" If an order is issued, some states require guns be turned over immediately, while others allow a short period of time. A search warrant authorizing seizure can also be issued in some states. Evers’ proposed red flag law for Wisconsin requires a hearing within 14 days of the preliminary order, and makes a final order valid for a year. It says guns should be seized if the judge finds ""reasonable grounds that the respondent is substantially likely"" to harm themselves or others. Requests can be made to either extend the final order or end it early. State law already requires guns be surrendered as a result of other judicial findings, such as mental health commitments and restraining orders, according to the Legislative Council. You may have noticed the word ""judge"" appeared frequently in the summary above. The Wisconsin proposal — contrary to Vos’ description — doesn’t allow any guns to be seized without a judicial order. Asked for evidence that judges aren’t initially involved in red flag law seizures, Vos spokeswoman Kit Beyer said Vos misheard the question. ""Speaker Vos thought Charles Benson had asked if the accused goes before a judge prior to an order to surrender,"" Beyer said. But that explanation doesn’t strike us as reasonable. Benson’s initial question about the red flag law was far less specific – asking if Vos thinks Wisconsin residents want to see it passed. And Vos’ second reference to a lack of judicial sign-off came after Benson simply read the wording of the Marquette poll. Descriptions of red flag laws consistently refer to decisions being made by judges. That’s the terminology used by Giffords, the Legislative Council, the National Conference of State Legislatures, the New York Times and many others. But there is an exception. Indiana’s law allows police to seize firearms without first obtaining a judicial order. However, they must then submit a statement to a judge, who can overturn the officer’s decision and refuse to issue a preliminary order, according to Giffords. Similar to other states, that preliminary order requires a hearing on a final order be held within 14 days. Beyer said Vos’ primary concern with the red flag laws relates to due process, since the preliminary order can be issued without the individual having a chance to dispute it. That is a core objection from other conservatives and groups that oppose red flag laws as well, including the National Rifle Association. Red flag laws have been challenged in other states, but courts have upheld them as constitutional on both Second Amendment and due process grounds, the Legislative Council said. That includes a ruling upholding the Florida law in September 2019. Vos said red flag laws mean ""they take it away first. Then you have to get permission from a judge to do it."" But red flag laws — including the one proposed in Wisconsin — don’t typically work like that. They involve police or family petitioning a judge, who must sign a preliminary order before any guns can be seized. Indiana does have a law set up as Vos describes, but even there the seizure decision by police is subject to immediate judicial review. And that’s the exception, not the rule",Mostly False,"October 28, 2019"

"""To be clear, I’m not talking about confiscating anybody’s guns.""","Democratic presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke is not talking about confiscating Americans’ guns  — except for when he is talking about it. On Oct. 16 on MSNBC’s ""Morning Joe,"" co-host Joe Scarborough opened an interview with the former Texas congressman by saying:  ""Tell us about your plan on the confiscation of guns which, obviously, many believe is unconstitutional, also very concerned that it plays right into the hands of Republican candidates.""  O’Rourke replied:  ""To be clear, I’m not talking about confiscating anybody’s guns. But I do think that, for those weapons of war  — AR-15s, AK-47s — these were designed and sold to the militaries of the world to kill people on a battlefield and there are more than 16 million of them in America. And we’ve seen the devastating effect that they can have in Dayton, Ohio, or El Paso, Texas, or Odessa, not too far from where I live. Those must be bought back or else each of them are an instrument potentially of terror in this country."" In reality, O’Rourke’s answer isn’t clear at all. We’ll help you sort out the mental gymnastics. In both the El Paso and the Dayton mass shootings, assault-style weapons, legal in both states, were used. Each weapon was semiautomatic — the gunmen could fire as quickly as they could pull the trigger — and carried enough ammunition to potentially kill dozens of people in minutes.  The El Paso shooter used a semi-automatic Kalashnikov-style rifle (also known as an AK-47-style rifle), which typically uses a magazine that has 30 rounds. The Dayton shooter used an AR-15-style pistol, modified to act as a rifle, with a drum magazine that can hold up to 100 rounds. At least two times previously, O’Rourke was asked whether he would support confiscation of guns he calls weapons of war. He said yes. Sept. 12 Democratic presidential debate Co-host David Muir: ""Some on this stage have suggested a voluntary buy-back for guns in this country. You've gone further. You've said, quote, ‘Americans who own AR-15s and AK-47s will have to sell them to the government, all of them.’ You know that critics call this confiscation. Are you proposing taking away their guns? And how would this work?"" O’Rourke: ""I am, if it's a weapon that was designed to kill people on a battlefield. ...When we see that being used against children, and in Odessa, I met the mother of a 15-year-old girl who was shot by an AR-15, and that mother watched her bleed to death over the course of an hour because so many other people were shot by that AR-15 in Odessa and Midland (Texas), there weren't enough ambulances to get to them in time, hell, yes, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47."" Sept. 18 CNN’s ""Cuomo Prime Time Host Chris Cuomo: ""All right, so let's state the proposition. Are you, in fact, in favor of gun confiscation? O'Rourke: ""Yes, when it comes to AR-15s and AK-47s, weapons designed for use on a military battlefield. ...So, when it comes to those weapons, Chris, the answer is yes. But when it comes to firearms used for hunting or self-defense, the answer is no."" On the same day as the ""Morning Joe"" interview, CNN ""New Day"" host Alysin Camerota asked O’Rourke: ""How do you plan to get assault weapons away from people who don’t want to give them up?"" O’Rourke replied: ""It’s pretty simple. As with any law in this country, we would expect our fellow Americans to follow the law."" Later, Camerota pushed back by saying mass shooters would not follow such a law. Then she said of O’Rourke’s proposal: ""It sounds like confiscation.""  O’Rourke replied: ""No, I’m not suggesting that. And I think that’s why people use the word confiscation, because it scares people. What I’m talking about is a mandatory buyback, where Americans who own an AR-15 or an AK-47 will sell that weapon back to the government.  O’Rourke made similar comments on ""Morning Joe."" Scarborough asked what the federal government would do if owners of AR-15s and AK-47s refused to sell. O’Rourke said: ""Just as in any law that is not followed or flagrantly abused, there have to be consequences or else there is no respect for the law. So, in that case, I think there would be a visit by law enforcement to recover that firearm and to make sure that it is purchased, bought back, so that it cannot be potentially used against somebody else."" (Update: We’ve added some additional context from O’Rourke’s statement after initially publishing this fact-check.)  Asked later in the interview about going door to door to take conventional handguns, O’Rourke said they aren’t as lethal as assault-style weapons and there is a legitimate use of handguns for protection in a home. O’Rourke’s campaign website says he is calling for ""a mandatory buyback program for assault weapons and a voluntary buyback program for handguns,"" and that ""individuals who fail to participate in the mandatory buyback of assault weapons will be fined."" ""Beto has been clear that he is talking about a mandatory buyback program for assault weapons, which is not confiscation,"" his campaign told us. O’Rourke’s argument that his plan isn’t confiscation ultimately rests on the fact that the government would buy the guns away from its owner. But that’s misleading. Gun owners wouldn’t have a say in the matter, and just because they’d be compensated, some likely wouldn’t see the trade in terms of equal value. Owners would be required to sell, and if they didn’t, what happens next is murky. O’Rourke says people might be fined, and that they might be somehow compelled to turn their weapons in through the buy-back program. As you game out scenarios how this might play out, they all lead to something that most people would consider confiscation. Clearly, many gun owners who legally purchased and own weapons that the government would take would view that as confiscation, even if they were paid for the guns. ""It is unreasonable to call what Mr. O’Rourke is proposing anything other than confiscation,"" gun law expert George Mocsary, a law professor at the University of Wyoming, told PolitiFact. ""Imagine the situation when an owner of one of the weapons refuses to sell. He or she is issued a fine. The owner still has the weapon, however. Does paying the fine mean that he or she can now keep the weapon and it is perfectly legal?  Certainly not,"" Mocsary said. ""There is no scenario under which the owner of one of the designated weapons gets to keep it. That is confiscation."" O’Rourke said: ""To be clear, I’m not talking about confiscating anybody’s guns."" O’Rourke has said ""yes"" and ""hell, yes"" when asked about confiscating assault-style weapons. And his mandatory buyback proposes taking those weapons from people, even if it involves a purchase",False,"October 21, 2019"
"""75-100 folks (are) killed a month and over 200 wounded by senseless gun violence.""","Former state Sen. Richard Ojeda, D-W.Va., recently lamented the toll of gun-related violence in the United States.

Is the number that large? When we reached out to Ojeda, he said we should look at the federal statistics and ""just do the research.""  We did, and we found that his numbers were actually an understatement.  The official data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides the number of gun-related deaths nationally. The most recent year for which data is available is 2017. Here are the figures: Homicides: 14,542 deaths by guns Suicides: 23,854 deaths by guns Other: 1,377 deaths by guns Total deaths by guns: 39,773 That works out to 3,314 total gun-related deaths nationally per month, and 1,212 gun-related homicides per month. Both figures are much higher than Ojeda’s estimate of 75 to 100 per month.  However, Ojeda’s figures would have been in the ballpark if he had been talking about gun-related deaths per day. There are about 109 gun-related deaths per day, about 40 of which are homicides and 65 of which are suicides. We also checked to see if the numbers work for firearm deaths in West Virginia alone. They don’t -- in this case, the number is too small. West Virginia saw 348 total deaths from guns in 2017, which works out to 29 per month, or close to one a day. What about injuries? The CDC has data on that as well.  In 2015, the most recent year available, there were 84,997 non-fatal injuries by guns nationally. That works out to 7,083 per month, a number well above the 200 Ojeda cited. Here, too, the data fits better if it’s calculated on a per-day basis. There were about 233 non-fatal injuries per day. That’s not far off from the number Ojeda offered. All told, though, his numbers are far off from what he said in the tweet. Our ruling Ojeda tweeted that ""75-100 folks (are) killed a month and over 200 wounded by senseless gun violence."" In fact, Ojeda understated the number of deaths and injuries from guns.

"Says ""90% of policemen are for"" expanding background checks to all gun sales.","In remarks during a visit to a Chicago hospital, Democratic U.S. Sen. Richard Durbin said President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell are standing in the way of efforts on Capitol Hill to address gun violence despite widespread public support. Trump and McConnell, he contended, have stonewalled efforts to expand background check requirements via bipartisan legislation that cleared the Democrat-controlled House more than 200 days ago. Current federal law requires background checks for sales by licensed gun dealers but not for gun sales by private sellers; the House bill would require background checks for all firearm purchases. ""Background checks just make sense,"" Durbin said. ""Turns out that 90% of policemen are for it, 90% of gun owners are for it, the overwhelming majority of members of the National Rifle Association are for it. And yet this president and the leader of the Senate refuse to act."" PolitiFact has previously checked claims about broad support for expanded background checks among the general public, along with statements that line up with what Durbin said about gun owners and members of the National Rifle Association widely backing them as well. But his claim about support among law enforcement wasn’t one we’d heard before, so we decided to check it out. A spokesperson for Durbin’s office pointed us to results from a survey published in 2017 by Pew Research Center, a generally reliable source for data. Experts we contacted told us they were not aware of any more recent surveys on the topic. That survey — conducted for Pew by the National Police Research Platform, a consortium of researchers headquartered at the University of Illinois at Chicago — found 88% of police support ""making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks."" The margin of error for the question was plus or minus two percentage points, according to a Pew spokesperson. As the survey’s detailed methodology section lays out, interviews were completed online during the summer of 2016 by nearly 8,000 officers from 54 police and sheriff’s departments across the country. Experts, including at Pew, explained there’s one caveat worth keeping in mind, though. The survey left out more rural, small-town police forces throughout the country: It provides a nationally representative sample of officers working in departments that employ at least 100 full-time sworn officers, but smaller departments were not included. ""While 88% appears to be a good estimate for this sampling frame, it may exclude a fraction of the nation’s officers who disproportionately hold more conservative views on gun control issues,"" said polling expert Steven Smith, a professor of social sciences and political science at Washington University in St. Louis. However, Smith noted, a substantial majority of police nationwide likely work for departments of the size that were included. Indeed, 63% of all sworn officers work in departments of more than 100 officers, according to Pew. So the result still speaks for the majority. To gain some insight into that position, we asked local law enforcement leaders why police are likely to support expanding background checks. ""Most of them want to protect the Constitution,"" said Frank Kaminski, police chief of Park Ridge, Ill. and a former president of the Illinois Association of Chiefs of Police. ""But they also see the violence in the streets every day and realize that we have to take common sense measures to reduce it."" ""When we talk about violence, we talk about violence not only to citizens but also to officers,"" he added. While speaking about legislation that would expand background checks to all gun sales, Durbin said 90% of police back such a policy. He was referencing a 2017 survey by Pew Research Center, which asked police at departments that employ 100 or more officers whether they support requiring background checks for private gun sales and sales at gun shows. Eighty-eight percent responded that they did. However, it’s important to note that survey left out officers at smaller, more rural jurisdictions who may not share the same views, and we could not find any other recent polls that addressed the question",Mostly True,"October 4, 2019"
"Universal background checks involve asking people ""to submit the serial numbers to their guns to a state or federal official,"" and that violates the Second Amendment.","Editor's Note: This item was updated to clarify that firearms dealers are required to fill out and reatain ATF Form 4473 for all types of gun purchases. Gun control is a contentious topic in Wisconsin’s divided government, with Democratic Gov. Tony Evers planning to force the issue by calling the Republican-controlled Legislature into a special session. The debate here and elsewhere typically centers on two types of legislation, both of which have been implemented in many other states: Red flag laws — These allow judges to temporarily remove firearms from people acting dangerously. Universal background checks — These measures require background checks for sales by private parties, in addition to gun dealers, which are already required by federal law. Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald was asked to weigh in on the topic in a Sept. 22, 2019, appearance on WISN-TV’s ""UpFront."" He said he didn’t see any momentum for red flag laws, then pivoted, unprompted, to the other gun control flashpoint. ""Universal background checks, too,"" said the Juneau Republican, who recently announced he is running for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. ""I mean, any time you’re going to ask somebody to submit the serial numbers to their guns to a state or federal official, it’s going to violate the Second Amendment."" This raises some questions worth examining. People can disagree on whether universal background checks are a good idea (polling shows most Wisconsinites think so), but we should at least be able to agree on what they are. So, do background checks really involve submitting serial numbers to the government? And would that violate the Second Amendment? How background checks work Fitzgerald’s office did not reply to our requests for evidence of his claim and more details on his position. But his response in the TV interview suggests universal background checks are tantamount to a gun registry — where the government keeps a record of which guns each person owns. It’s a common argument from opponents of universal background checks, who see it as a step toward confiscation. But it’s an over-simplification of a nuanced issue. There’s no, well, universal version of universal background checks, but the basic concept is that private sellers are subject to the same general requirements as licensed gun dealers, including background checks on the would-be purchaser and keeping records of the sale. Wisconsin is one of 29 states that currently do not require background checks or record-keeping on private gun sales. At the federal level, the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives does not regulate private sales as it does those involving licensed firearm dealers. Some states — including California, Colorado, Delaware, District of Columbia, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington — require all private sales be conducted through firearm dealers, who then retain sales records, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, a research and advocacy organization. They call that the ""most comprehensive policy option."" Other states give private sellers the option of going through law enforcement directly for the background check. The record-keeping requirements vary, with some states leaving that to the individual selling the gun and others requiring transfers be reported to local law enforcement. RELATED: Can you buy a gun in Wisconsin after a felony or restraining order? In Wisconsin, any universal background check would have to be integrated with the current system for gun dealer sales, which splits background check responsibilities based on the type of gun. The state Department of Justice handles background checks for handgun sales, while long gun sales go through the National Criminal Background Check Systems, run by the FBI. What information is submitted to the government Fitzgerald says he objects to universal background checks because of the new requirements they would place on private gun sales, so let’s examine how those could look. If Wisconsin implemented a comprehensive universal background check system, routing all sales through dealers, the flow of information to authorities would be the same as it is now for dealer sales. For long gun sales, dealers fill out ATF form 4473 — which includes the gun make and serial number — and submit it to the FBI’s criminal background system. The FBI conducts the background check but is required by federal law to destroy identifying information on the purchaser and gun within 24 hours. The dealer is then required to keep a copy of the 4473 form for at least 20 years. After that point, or if the dealer goes out of business, the form is turned over to the ATF. But federal law forbids the ATF from storing these records in a searchable format or otherwise using them ""to establish any system for the registration of firearms."" The records are retained using decades-old microfilm technology, making gun tracing a painstaking, manual process. For handguns, Wisconsin dealers still fill out and retain the form 4473, but background checks are done by the Wisconsin Department of Justice. State law requires dealers to submit the name, date of birth, gender, Social Security number and other identifying information to the Wisconsin DOJ. But the agency does not receive or store serial numbers or any other firearm information, said spokeswoman Gillian Drummond. So under a comprehensive system, serial numbers would — eventually — make it to a government agency. But it is typically decades before that happens, and the agency is then prohibited from turning those into a database. If Wisconsin opted for a less comprehensive system, less information would go to the government. For example, if the state DOJ were tasked with all background checks for private sales and private sellers were required to maintain their own records (as in Illinois), no serial numbers would be submitted to any government entity for any private gun sales. Would a gun registry violate the Second Amendment? All of this brings us to the last element of Fitzgerald’s claim — that submitting serial numbers to government officials violates the Second Amendment. Courts have said that isn’t true. Six states and the District of Columbia already require registration of some or all firearms, according to the Giffords Law Center. ""These state laws have been in place for decades and have not been overturned on the grounds that they violate an individual’s Second Amendment rights,"" said Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research. ""Nothing in any Supreme Court ruling to date would suggest that a government requirement that gun owners provide serial numbers for the guns they purchase or own to government officials violates the Second Amendment."" For example, a challenge to the Washington, D.C. registration requirement in 2015 was largely upheld by a federal appeals court. The ruling stripped away some elements of the law but left untouched the basic requirement that guns be registered. Our ruling Fitzgerald says universal background checks would involve asking people to submit their guns’ serial numbers to the government, which would violate the Second Amendment. The serial numbers that are submitted for background checks don’t end up in government hands for years or decades. And then the federal agency is barred from fashioning them into a database. What’s more, there is no evidence such a requirement would violate the Second Amendment, since several states have gun registries that have not been struck down by the courts — and a similar provision was upheld by federal courts in a Washington, D.C. case",Mostly False,"October 4, 2019"
"Since Israel started training teachers with guns, ""there have only been two school shootings in 44 years and both shooters were killed by teachers.""","As communities across the country grapple with school shootings, a widely-shared Facebook post suggests the United States should use Israel as a role model.  ""School shooting Israel 1974,"" the Aug. 13 post says. ""They began training teachers with guns. There have been only two school shootings in 44 years, and both shooters were killed by teachers. Have we learned anything yet, America?"" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The post is both wrong about arming teachers, and wrong about how shooters were killed. Let’s break down the Facebook post’s claims.  In 1974, more than 20 students were killed when Palestinian guerillas held students hostage in a school in Ma’alot, Israel. The Palestinians were killed ""in a bloody gun battle"" after Israeli soldiers raided the school building.  But, as the Associated Press reported in 2012, Israel didn’t mandate armed guards at the entrances to all schools until 1995, more than two decades after the Ma’alot attack and two years after a Palestinian militant injured students and a principal in a knifing attack at a school. That same article, which challenges a statement by NRA chief Wayne LaPierre that’s similar to the one in this Facebook post, notes that, in 2012, Israeli authorities could only recall two school shootings in the past four decades.  In 2008, eight people, most of them teens, were killed when a Palestinian assailant attacked them at a nighttime study session at a Jewish religious seminary in Jerusalem. But that assailant was killed by an off-duty soldier who happened to be in the area, according to the AP — not a teacher.  Searching this list kept by the Israel Ministory of Foreign Affairs of ""Palestinian terror and incitement"" since September 2000, another shooting happened in 2002 when three yeshiva high school students were killed at their Orthodox school by a Palestinian gunman before he was shot dead by a security guard — not a teacher.  That’s because, by policy, teachers are not armed in Israeli schools, the Washington Post reported in February 2018.  ""Professionals deal with security,"" the Post quotes Amos Shavit, a spokesman for Israel’s Ministry of Education, as saying.

"Says an 11-year-old girl shot and killed two armed ""illegal aliens"" after they broke into her home in Montana.","Did an 11-year-old girl shoot and kill two ""illegal aliens"" during a home invasion in Montana? No. This faux tale is more than 12 years old and continues to resurface on social media even though it’s been debunked several times over the years.  The rumor showed up on Facebook again on Sept. 20 on the page ""Adorable Deplorables for Trump"" and has gotten over 500 comments and more than 1,500 shares.  The post shared an image of a young girl holding a shotgun with text below it that recounts the story: ""11-YEAR-OLD WHO SHOT ILLEGALS. Two illegal aliens, Ralphel Resindez, 23, and Enrico Garza, 26, probably believed they would easily overpower home-alone 11-year-old Patricia Harrington after her father had left their two-story home. It seems these crooks never learned two things: 1. They were in Montana. 2. Patricia had been a clay shooting champion since she was nine...""   The post goes on to say that the girl grabbed a shotgun and killed both men before police were able to arrive and that one of the immigrants had already killed another man during an earlier home invasion. At the end it asks if you ever wonder why ""good stuff"" never makes the news. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) First, a reverse-image search revealed the girl in the photo is actually a 14-year-old from New Jersey who was featured in a piece by the New Yorker about kids who use recreational firearms. And the story about the girl shooting intruders ""never made the news"" because it never actually happened. The account can only be found in other websites that repeat the same information, with no additional details.  A search of the Nexis database surfaced a few stories where young people helped thwart home invasions by using firearms over the years, but none lined up with the post.  We did find a 1988 story of an 11-year-old shooting and killing two burglars – but the child was a boy and the incident took place in Switzer, South Carolina. As well, the men were not named ""Ralphel Resindez"" and ""Enrico Garza,"" but were two ex-convicts named Danny Ray Abernathy and Broadus Petty.  Some earlier versions of the rumor named the Montana town of Butte as being the location of the incident, but a 2007 story by the Montana Standard newspaper, which included an interview with the town’s sheriff, called the shooting ""nothing but an urban myth:"" ""When asked about the authenticity of the events described in this story, Butte-Silver Bow Sheriff John Walsh told The Montana Standard in an earlier interview that his office never investigated such an incident. ‘This never happened,’ Walsh said. The story claims the girl shot and killed the two intruders while she was home alone. The story doesn’t provide a street address or attribute the information to any official sources. Walsh brushed off the story of an urban myth. ‘It’s amazing how these things get around,’ he said."" Phillip Morris, a columnist with The Plain Dealer, wrote a piece about the myth in 2013: ""There was no Ralphel Resindez, there was no Enrico Garza, and despite her elevation to heroine status with some gun rights groups, there was no little girl named Patricia who bravely defended her home with her father's shotgun. So why does this story still circulate? ""Probably, because it seems perfectly believable.

"""You can have an active warrant for your arrest for murder and legally pass a background check system in the state of Texas"" to purchase a gun.","Democrats in Texas are urging Gov. Greg Abbott to call a special legislative session to tackle gun violence in the wake of two mass shootings in the state that left 29 people dead. Lawmakers pushing for the session held a news conference outside of the Texas Capitol in early September, including state Rep. Gina Hinojosa, D-Austin, who made an eye-catching claim about eligibility requirements for gun licenses in the state. ""You can have an active warrant for your arrest for murder and legally pass a background check system in the state of Texas,"" Hinojosa said. Hinojosa’s staff said her claim is true, since the U.S. Department of Justice adopted a new interpretation for ""fugitive from justice,"" meaning the classification only refers to people wanted by law enforcement who have crossed state lines. A similar statement was repeated by Democratic state lawmakers during a hearing at the state Capitol on gun legislation at the end of September. The claim needs more context. In certain cases, someone with an active arrest warrant for murder could legally pass a background check and buy a gun in Texas, but it depends on where and how the warrant was issued. Before we dive into this fact-check, let’s explore the process for running a background check on a prospective gun-purchaser in Texas. Federal law requires licensed-gun dealers to run background checks on prospective buyers who do not have a license to carry. (A license is required to carry a handgun in public but is not required to purchase a gun.) Private sellers do not have to conduct background checks before making a sale. A person without a license to carry who is buying a gun in Texas from a licensed dealer must undergo a background check by first providing a photo ID and completing a form produced by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to determine whether the individual falls into any category of person prohibited from purchasing a firearm. Federal and Texas laws state that a person cannot purchase or possess a firearm if the person has been convicted of a felony or certain misdemeanors related to domestic assault and the person's release from confinement or supervision occurred within the previous five years. Certain people with a history of mental illness also are barred from purchasing a gun, as is anyone who is considered a ""fugitive from justice"" — a category we’ll explore more in-depth later. Texas is not a ""point of contact"" state, which means the FBI runs background checks for prospective purchasers in the state. Once a request has been submitted by a dealer, the FBI has three business days to complete the check. After that period, the sale can go forward — even if the FBI has not completed its review. The FBI could later issue a ""delayed denial"" if the agency completes the check after the three-day window and discovers that a sale was completed for an individual who should have been barred from buying a gun. At that point, the case is referred to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which is responsible for recovering the firearm. Chelsea O’Hara, chief of staff to Hinojosa, said the Democrat’s statement is true under the new federal interpretation of fugitive from justice, a classification that forbids someone from purchasing a firearm. Before the shift, a person with an active arrest warrant for murder would have fit the definition, but the new interpretation changes things. O’Hara pointed to a news story about the change and provided a copy of a letter distributed by the FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) division outlining the claim. She also shared a copy of the ATF form prospective purchasers are required to complete. The form includes the updated definition. The FBI and ATF had disagreed on who is considered a fugitive from justice since at least 2008, according to a 2016 audit from the Office of the Inspector General at the Department of Justice. Under the FBI’s original definition, any individual with an outstanding arrest warrant would be unable to buy a gun. But the ATF considered a fugitive from justice only a person who has an outstanding arrest warrant and then leaves the state where the warrant was issued. In 2017, the Department of Justice sided with the ATF, prompting the FBI to purge the names of tens of thousands of people wanted by law enforcement agencies from its background check database, according to The Washington Post. A handful of states prevent anyone with an arrest warrant from purchasing a firearm, but Texas is not one of them. The FBI’s original definition for fugitive from justice would have included individuals with active warrants for their arrest for murder and other charges, thereby preventing them from buying a gun. But under the new definition, the existence of an arrest warrant on its own is no longer enough to deny the sale or transfer of a firearm to an individual, according to a statement provided by the National Instant Criminal Background Check System division at the FBI. In other words, the fugitive from justice statute would not necessarily stop a person with an active arrest warrant for murder issued in Texas from passing a background check to purchase a gun in the state. But such a person might be stopped by a different portion of the law. In addition to preventing fugitives from justice or people recently convicted of felonies or certain misdemeanors involving domestic violence from purchasing guns, the law also bars gun purchases for people with active arrest warrants that have ""been issued pursuant to an indictment for a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year,"" according to ATF spokeswoman Carolyn Gwathmey. This would include murder charges. Generally, an arrest warrant can be issued at the discretion of a judge or by way of a grand jury indictment, depending on the circumstances of a case. In murder cases, it is more common for a warrant to be issued by a judge than from a grand jury, to get a suspect off the street and into custody as soon as possible. Jennifer Szimanski, a public affairs officer at the Combined Law Enforcement Associations of Texas and a former detective at the Austin Police Department, said the investigating team might pursue an arrest warrant from a judge if they have ""very strong evidence of a crime being committed and the case appears ironclad."" She said investigators might pursue an indictment from a grand jury if ""the evidence is not as strong and mostly circumstantial"" but investigators are confident they’ve identified the right suspect. ""So your basic question, can someone wanted for murder roll into a gun store in Texas and buy a gun? The answer is yes — if that person’s warrant was issued just by a judge and doesn’t involve an indictment, and if there is no evidence readily available to the FBI or ATF that (the person) somehow sought to avoid that warrant,"" said David Chipman, a senior policy advisor at the Giffords Law Center and a former special agent at ATF. The idea behind the policy is that an individual would not lose their ability to access firearms until they have been convicted of a crime, according to John Donohue, a law professor at Stanford University. ""It’s certainly true that if there is more (in a person’s history) than just an arrest warrant, you may be curtailed,"" he said. ""But on its face, the statement says if you’re in Texas buying a gun with a warrant for arrest as a Texas resident, you’re probably fine. To me, that seems absolutely ludicrous. But it is the law."" Hinojosa said, ""You can have an active warrant for your arrest for murder and legally pass a background check system in the state of Texas."" Hinojosa’s claim needs more context. It’s true that certain people with active arrest warrants for murder could legally pass a background check in Texas and purchase a gun — but only if the warrant was issued prior to an indictment and if it originated in Texas. If an arrest warrant for murder was the result of an indictment or was issued in another state, the person could not pass a background check",Mostly True,"September 20, 2019"
"""Beto O’Rourke wants to confiscate guns because he can’t buy one himself due to his criminal record.""","Democrat Beto O’Rourke doubled down on his pitch to institute a mandatory gun buyback program for assault-style weapons during the third debate of the presidential primary in Houston. ""Hell yes, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47,"" O’Rourke said at the debate. "" We're not going to allow it to be used against our fellow Americans anymore."" His comments were met with boisterous applause from the audience at Texas Southern University and he was on the receiving end of a threatening remark from a state lawmaker in Texas. They also sparked a questionable Facebook post, shared the day after the debate. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The post included a popular meme that is derived from stills of Drake’s 2015 music video for ""Hotline Bling."" The meme traditionally features two images of the singer and corresponding text generated by the poster. The idea is to make it appear as though Drake is shunning the first phrase, but welcoming the second. In the post in question, the first phrase is: ""Beto O’Rourke wants to confiscate the guns because he’s a liberal."" The second, which Drake seems to signal his approval of, reads: ""Beto O’Rourke wants to confiscate guns because he can’t buy one himself due to his criminal record."" The text of the post says: ""That burglary and DWI will get you every time."" We’ve looked at O’Rourke’s arrest record in the past, but is he ineligible to purchase a gun, as the post suggests? Both DWI, burglary arrests were dismissed O’Rourke was arrested twice in the 1990s — for, what he describes as, jumping a fence on the campus at the University of Texas at El Paso and for driving while intoxicated. He was first arrested in May 1995 on the UTEP campus for attempted forcible entry, according to a copy of the police report provided by O’Rourke’s campaign in 2018. The charge fell under the burglary portion of the state penal code, section 30.02. O’Rourke told the El Paso Times in 2005 that UTEP ""decided not to press charges"" and a LexisNexis background check of O’Rourke shows that the Class B misdemeanor was dismissed. In September 1998, O’Rourke was arrested and charged with driving while intoxicated in Anthony, a small town outside El Paso. A witness told police officers that they observed O’Rourke driving at a high speed before losing control of his car and striking a truck, according to a police report of the incident. O’Rourke then attempted to drive away, but the witness stopped him, according to the report. Law enforcement arrived and arrested O’Rourke, recording that he scored a 0.136 and 0.134 on a breathalyzer test, above a blood-alcohol level of 0.10, the state legal limit at the time. O’Rourke was charged with a misdemeanor DWI, but the charge was dismissed after he completed a misdemeanor diversion program in 1999. In summary: O’Rourke was arrested for two separate misdemeanors in the 1990s, including one for a DWI. Both cases were dismissed. O’Rourke could purchase a gun There is no requirement for a person to have a permit or license to purchase rifles and shotguns or handguns in Texas, O’Rourke’s home state. As long as a purchaser is older than 18 and, in certain cases, passes a background check, the person can legally purchase a firearm without a permit. (A permit is required to carry a handgun in public.) Licensed-gun dealers are required by federal law to conduct a background check for an individual seeking to purchase a gun if that person does not have a license to carry. But private sellers do not have the same requirement. Federal and state laws in Texas prevent a person from purchasing and possessing a gun if they have previously been convicted of a felony or convicted of certain misdemeanors related to domestic assault. Certain people with a history of mental illness are also barred from purchasing a gun. O’Rourke would be able to purchase a gun, since he was not convicted of burglary or of driving while intoxicated — both charges were dismissed. Even if he had been convicted, neither charge would prevent him from legally purchasing and possessing a firearm today, since they were both misdemeanor offenses unrelated to domestic violence and were resolved more than five years ago. O’Rourke could also obtain a gun license Misdemeanor DWI offenses play a more significant role when it comes to obtaining a license to carry in Texas. State law allows for people, not including those in the prohibited categories outlined above, to possess a handgun in their home or in their car without a license to carry. People can also carry rifles and shotguns in public without a permit. In order to purchase a gun without a background check and to carry a handgun in public, a person must obtain a license to carry from the state. Requirements for obtaining such a license are more stringent than those for simply purchasing a gun. Most important in O’Rourke’s case is a requirement that a person is not currently facing charges for ""a Class A or Class B misdemeanor or equivalent offense"" and a requirement that an individual ""has not, in the five years preceding the date of application, been convicted of a Class A or Class B misdemeanor or equivalent offense."" The law also states that a person is not eligible to receive a license to carry if the person has been ""convicted two times within the 10-year period preceding the date on which the person applies for a license of an offense of the grade of Class B misdemeanor or greater that involves the use of alcohol or a controlled substance as a statutory element of the offense."" O’Rourke was arrested on a burglary charge in 1995, a misdemeanor offense that was dismissed. He was arrested for DWI in 1998, a misdemeanor offense that also was dismissed after he completed a diversion program. Neither arrest, taken separately or together, would prevent him from obtaining a license to carry a gun under Texas law. ""He has no convictions on his record, so there is zero collateral consequence, vis-à-vis his ability to get a gun license,"" said Steve Toland, an Austin-based defense attorney who handles DWI cases. The Texas Department of Public Safety, which administers the licensing program, lists answers to frequently asked questions on its website, including one about how dismissed charges affect eligibility. ""If charges were dismissed without prosecution, then they are not disqualifying,"" the post reads. If O’Rourke’s misdemeanor DWI had not been dismissed and he had been convicted, he would still be eligible to apply for a gun license today, since more than five years have passed. Had O’Rourke applied for a license after his arrests, when the charges were still pending, he would not have been eligible for a gun license. But since he was not convicted of either charge, he would have been eligible for a license once his cases had been dismissed. Our Ruling A Facebook post circulating after the Democratic debate said that O’Rourke can’t buy a gun ""due to his criminal record."" O’Rourke was arrested for two misdemeanors in the 1990s — for burglary and DWI. Both cases were dismissed and he was not convicted of either charge.

"Says people convicted of felonies or under restraining orders ""can buy a firearm without going through a background check.""","Gun control is yet again — tragically — up for debate in Wisconsin. After mass shootings at an El Paso Walmart and a Dayton, Ohio, entertainment district left 31 dead, Wisconsin leaders have raised questions about ""loopholes"" in state law. Democratic lawmakers introduced legislation in August 2019 that would require background checks for nearly all gun sales. Gov. Tony Evers, a fellow Democrat, has threatened to call a special session on the matter if Republican legislative leaders don’t take up the bill. This comes as 80% of state residents support universal background checks — including 75% of gun owners — according to a Marquette University Law School Poll conducted in mid-August. So how is that different from what Wisconsin has now? The state’s Democratic attorney general offered an example. ""Because we don’t have universal background checks, people who are a danger to others — including people who have been convicted of a dangerous felony or are subject to a domestic violence restraining order — currently can buy a firearm without going through a background check,"" Josh Kaul said in an Aug. 15, 2019, tweet. State Sen. Jennifer Shilling, D-LaCrosse, raised the same point with a tweet earlier that day. Can someone in those circumstances really purchase a gun without a background check? A convicted felon, or someone with an active restraining order connected to domestic violence, would not pass a criminal background check to qualify for a firearm purchase. Such background checks are required under federal law for any purchase of a firearm from a Federal Firearm Licenses dealer — which would include any retailers or others engaged in gun sales as a profession. In Wisconsin, the state Department of Justice handles background checks for handgun sales, while long gun sales go through the National Criminal Background Check Systems, said DOJ spokeswoman Gillian Drummond. This two-pronged system covers the ""vast majority"" of firearm purchases in the state, Kaul said in an Aug. 9, 2019, appearance on Wisconsin Public Television’s ""Here and Now."" This is the process gun rights advocates refer to when noting background checks already exist.  But it’s not the only way to buy a gun. A 2015 study found 22% of gun owners bought their most recent firearm without going through a background check. That’s because gun sales in Wisconsin between private parties (those without a federal firearms license) aren’t subject to reporting, waiting period or background check requirements. The U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives does not regulate private sales as it does those involving dealers. And Wisconsin is one of 29 states that does not impose any state-level regulations either, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, a research and advocacy organization that seeks ""laws, policies, and programs proven to save lives from gun violence.""  Websites such as Armslist — a Craigslist-style firearms marketplace — connect private sellers and are heavily used. A search in September 2019 showed more than 2,000 firearms for sale from private parties in Wisconsin.  Two guns used in high-profile shootings here were purchased through Armslist by people under court orders not to possess guns. In October 2012, Radcliffe Haughton killed three people including his estranged wife and injured four others, before killing himself at Azana Salon & Spa in Brookfield. A day before the shooting he purchased a .40-caliber handgun in the parking lot of a Germantown McDonald’s after connecting with the seller on Armslist. Two days before that, a judge had issued a restraining order that barred Haughton from owning a gun. In January 2018, Robert Schmidt bought a Glock 9 mm handgun from a 19-year-old man through Armslist, days after he was released from the Calumet County jail on a bond that prohibited him from having a gun. The transaction took place in a Walmart parking lot. Schmidt was charged at the time with raping his wife at gunpoint. The next night he used that gun to kill his wife and then himself at a home just outside Appleton. Kaul said felons and people subject to domestic abuse restraining orders are currently able to buy guns in Wisconsin without going through a background check. All purchases from firearms dealers are subject to state and federal requirements that include a criminal background check. But Kaul is right that Wisconsin is among the states with no oversight of gun sales between private parties. That has allowed people in the circumstances he described to buy guns, in some cases with tragic results",True,"September 13, 2019"
"""54 senators said, let's do background checks, let's get rid of assault weapons, and with 54 senators it failed because of the filibuster.""","Sen.

""I was in the United States Senate when 54 senators said let's do background checks, let's get rid of assault weapons, and with 54 senators it failed because of the filibuster."" Not all of those points are accurate. Her campaign staff told us Warren meant to refer only to background checks. Fewer than 50 senators supported banning assault weapons. In April 2013, a few months after the Sandy Hook shooting, lawmakers took up votes on multiple gun control measures. All of them failed. Sen. Joe Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat, teamed up with Pennsylvania Republican Sen. Pat Toomey on the legislation, which came to be known as the Manchin-Toomey amendment.  The amendment called for expanding the checks to gun shows and internet sales, but not requiring them of family members and friends giving or selling guns to each other. It was seen as a compromise to replace a stricter measure from Majority Leader Harry Reid. The compromise amendment still fell short in a mostly partisan vote, when it was defeated 54-46. Procedurally, the amendment needed 60 votes to pass. On the same day, an assault weapons ban measure by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., failed when it received 40 votes. Fifteen members of her own Democratic Party (plus one independent) voted against the ban. At the time, Democrats held 53 seats in the Senate, two independents caucused with the Democrats, and 45 senators were Republicans. A spokeswoman for Warren said that her reference to 54 votes was for that Manchin-Toomey amendment. In a Medium essay in August, Warren wrote that the Senate voted down an assault weapons ban and ""rejected a background checks proposal, even though 54 Senators from both parties voted for it, because of a right-wing-filibuster. These were the bare minimum steps we needed to take. And six years later, Congress still hasn’t done a thing."" Warren said ""54 senators said let's do background checks, let's get rid of assault weapons, and with 54 senators it failed because of the filibuster."" Warren was referring to votes on gun control legislation on April 17, 2013.

""Over 90% of the American people think we have to get assault weapons off the street — period,"" Biden said during the Democratic presidential debate in Houston Sept. 12. Biden was responding to a moderator’s question about his failure to get an expanded background check bill passed after the Sandy Hook school mass shooting in 2012.  The recent polls we found showed that a majority of Americans support banning assault weapons, but by a much smaller margin than Biden cited. A 1994 law barred the ""manufacture, transfer, and possession"" of about 118 firearm models and all magazines holding over 10 rounds. The ban expired in 2004. Efforts to renew the ban have been unsuccessful, but Biden has vowed to champion a ban. We looked at the results of five polls taken after the early August mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio. We limited our search to that time period because the question by debate moderator David Muir mentioned the El Paso shooting. Overall, polls showed between 56% and 70% of people back a ban on assault rifles. Polls showed higher support among Democrats. Politico/Morning Consult poll: Nearly 70% of all voters would back a ban on assault rifles. (In a New York Times op-ed in August, Biden cited that statistic.) More than 91 percent supported requiring background checks for all gun sales. Fox News poll: 67% supported banning assault rifles and semi-automatic weapons. The poll found 90% support for background checks on all gun buyers including at shows and private sales. NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll: 57% said Congress should pass a ban on the sale of semi-automatic assault guns such as the AK-47 or the AR-15.

HuffPost/YouGov poll: 59% favor an assault weapons ban and 81% favored background checks. We asked the Biden campaign for his evidence and did not hear back immediately.

""But if we wait for this kind of corporate responsibility across the country given the number of gun shows and gun dealers and gun stores, we’ll be waiting for the rest of our lives,"" O’Rourke said. ""There are 390 million guns out on the streets of a country of 329 million people. We have to take decisive action and it has to come from our government."" Is O’Rourke right on his figures about the number of guns in the country? The last time PolitiFact looked at these numbers, it was estimated that there were roughly 310 million civilian-owned guns in the United States. New survey Chris Evans, a spokesman for O’Rourke, pointed to a report published by the Global Small Arms Survey in May 2019 that found there are more civilian-owned firearms in the United States than in any other country. The Small Arms Survey, an operation at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva, found that there were more than 393 million civilian firearms holdings in the United States, as of June 2018. The report also detailed firearms owned by the U.S. military — about 4.5 million — and by law enforcement agencies — about 1 million. The group’s estimates are developed using a variety of data sources and its work is considered by experts to be the most comprehensive research that exists on private gun ownership globally. In the United States, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives publishes annual reports about the number of firearms that have been manufactured, exported and imported. It also looks at the number of federal licenses issued to manufacturers. But a spokesman for the agency said it does not have an aggregate figure for the total number of guns in circulation. A 2012 report from the Congressional Research Service estimated that in 1996 there were 242 million civilian-owned firearms; in 2000 there were 259 million; and in 2009 there were 310 million. The figure for 2009 was significant, as it marked the first year that the number of civilian-owned firearms surpassed the nation’s total population, according to the Washington Post. Evans pointed to reporting from the Washington Post on the latest Small Arms Survey report, an article titled: ""There are more guns than people in the United States, according to a new study of global firearm ownership."" The Washington Post found that, using the estimate from the Small Arms Survey, there are enough civilian-owned firearms in the United States ""for every man, woman and child to own one and still have 67 million guns left over."" At the end of June 2018, when the estimate was published, the United States’ population was roughly 327 million. Today, it is more than 329 million. Globally, researchers with the group estimate that 85% of the 1 billion firearms in global circulation are in civilian hands — that’s 857 million guns. Of the remaining guns, roughly 13% are in military use and 2% are owned by law enforcement agencies. The number of firearms around the world has increased substantially, largely due to an increase in civilians purchasing guns, researchers found. The number of civilian-owned guns worldwide grew from 650 million in 2006 to 857 million in 2017. The United States makes up the bulk of all civilian-owned firearms. ""Even after adjusting for population, it is clear that the United States far outnumbers other countries,"" reads a release from the group. ""The United States has 4% of the world’s population, but its civilians hold almost 40% of the world’s firearms."" Our Ruling O’Rourke said, ""There are 390 million guns out on the streets of a country of 329 million people.""

"Florida’s red flag gun law has been used ""about five times a day.""","Law enforcement officials are using Florida’s so-called ""red flag"" law to remove guns from people five times a day. That’s what Palm Beach County State Attorney Dave Aronberg said on MSNBC when asked about the state’s implementation of the red flag law, enacted after the Parkland, Fla., school shooting. ""That law is being used by law enforcement to get a judge to take away guns from someone who is deemed a threat to himself or others,"" Aronberg, a Democrat, told ""Morning Joe"" host Mika Brzezinski on Aug. 26. ""It has been used about 2,500 times in the state of Florida in the past year and a half. That’s about five times a day."" As recent mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton renew calls to pass red flag laws to keep guns out of the hands of people who pose a danger, we wanted to look closer at Aronberg’s claim and examine how the Florida law is changing how guns are treated day to day. About 15 states have red flag or extreme risk laws. The laws allow police to petition a court to order the temporary removal of firearms from a person who may be dangerous, or to block the person from obtaining a firearm. After a set amount of time, the firearm is either returned to the person or the court order is extended. (In some states, family members can petition a court to remove the firearm, but in Florida relatives have to contact the police.) We found Aronberg correctly cited state court data on the number of times a judge has issued a risk protection order. Aronberg told us he got his number about the roughly 2,500 cases from an NPR story. (The Tampa Bay Times previously reported the same ballpark figure.) That works out to around five per day since the law took effect in March 2018. Since then through July 2019, there were 2,396 risk protection orders issued by judges statewide. Counties with the highest number of orders were Polk (378), Pinellas (350), Broward (327), Volusia (173) and Miami-Dade (127). We interviewed law enforcement officials in Broward and Pinellas counties about how they have implemented the law. Broward’s chief judge Jack Tuter said that when a law enforcement agency determines a person poses a threat to himself or others, the agency requests a risk protection order. A judge holds a hearing within 24 hours with the police officers who swear to the allegations. If the judge enters the temporary risk protection order, the judge will order a search of the respondent's home to secure any firearms or ammunition.  Within a couple of weeks, a judge holds a final hearing at which point a person can oppose the order. This is a civil process, so the respondent is allowed to hire a lawyer but there is no right to a court-appointed lawyer. Tuter estimated that in 90% of the cases, the orders are agreed to by the respondent. The order can last for up to a year and then law enforcement can seek to renew it. The person’s name is also entered into the national database to prevent federal dealers from selling the person a firearm.  Risk protection orders require judges to take a different outlook than they would for a typical criminal case in which a judge is evaluating past behavior. Judges are asked to predict a person’s future behavior ⁠— ""whether the person is going to carry out the threat,"" Tuter said.  Statewide data show that the vast majority of petitions lead to judges granting the orders. PolitiFact found no public record that showed the total number of guns surrendered, but Pinellas Sheriff Bob Gualtieri said in his county people surrendered about 700 firearms and over 135,000 rounds of ammunition. Gualtieri said that one man who was fired from his restaurant job for making inappropriate advances to female employees sent text messages indicating he planned to shoot the women and himself. He was arrested, and then law enforcement sought a risk protection order and found he had an AR-15 and 471 rounds of ammunition. Kristi MacKenzie, an attorney for the Broward Sheriff’s Office, estimated that around 25% of the risk protection order cases have a parallel criminal case. In other situations, the person has committed no crime, but has prompted concerns that the person poses a danger.  In a case handled by Lighthouse Point police, a man acted strangely and turned off electrical breakers in his condo building ""to prevent them from sending electrical impulses through his body and controlling him,"" according to court records. The man told police he was being targeted by a neighbor who looked like Osama bin Laden. He voluntarily surrendered his firearms. There have been some misconceptions that the law provides no due process or that police are simply seizing guns, but that’s not the case. When a Broward sheriff deputy flags a case, it must first be approved by higher-ups in the sheriff’s office and then reviewed by at least two attorneys before it goes to a judge. ""There are a lot of layers of protection there,"" MacKenzie said. Aronberg said Florida’s red flag gun law has been used ""about five times a day"" since it was enacted about a year and a half ago. His math is correct. Between March 2018 and July 2019, there were about 2,400 risk protection orders issued statewide. That means people were prevented from having a gun temporarily, but we don’t know in total how many guns were surrendered",True,"September 3, 2019"
"The ""boyfriend loophole"" means that ""if you commit a serious crime of domestic abuse against your wife, you can't get a gun, but if you do it against your girlfriend, you can.""","After the mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton, U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat who is running for president, called for eliminating the ""boyfriend loophole."" The loophole, she said on MSNBC, ""means that right now if you commit a serious crime of domestic abuse against your wife, you can’t get a gun, but if you do it against your girlfriend, you can, which is outrageous."" Klobuchar has a point, but she oversimplifies the situation. Federal law bars anyone convicted of any felony from possessing a firearm.  But the gun prohibition, as cited to us by Klobuchar’s campaign, also is imposed on people convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence.  That provision applies to anyone who has or had a domestic relationship with the victim, said University of Wyoming law professor George Mocsary, co-author of a law school textbook on gun laws. So, despite Klobuchar’s claim, the provision applies to more than just current or former spouses. It applies if the perpetrator in the domestic abuse has a child in common with the victim; lives or lived with the victim; or is ""similarly situated to a spouse."" As for the ""similarly situated"" language, some courts have said live-in boyfriends would be covered by the law, said Jacob Charles, executive director of the Center for Firearms Law at Duke University. And a regulation promulgated by the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives makes it clear that live-in partners are covered, Mocsary said. Klobuchar’s claim of a loophole is accurate to the extent that the law does not apply to a boyfriend who is or was simply dating the victim, but not sharing a residence or children.  But Mocsary said there is a difference in risk when there is a gun in a domestic situation versus someone who owns a gun but doesn’t live with their girlfriend. ""Everyone agrees that a firearm in a household with domestic violence poses a clear increased danger to the abused partner,"" he told PolitiFact. But there is no reliable evidence ""that there is a similar increased danger"" in non-cohabitation situations, he said. Klobuchar’s claim was made in the context of federal law. But it’s worth noting that 23 states have laws that prohibit at least some abusive dating partners from gaining access to firearms, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.  That includes 19 states that bar people convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence from possessing a gun. Among them are California, Texas, Illinois and New York. Klobuchar said the ""boyfriend loophole"" means that ""if you commit a serious crime of domestic abuse against your wife, you can't get a gun, but if you do it against your girlfriend, you can."" The gun prohibition, which is in federal law, does not apply to boyfriends who are, or were, in mere dating or more casual relationships.  But it does apply to boyfriends who have a child in common with the domestic violence victim; live or lived with the victim; or who are ""similarly situated to a spouse."" Also, 19 states have similar laws on misdemeanor domestic violence cases. Klobuchar’s statement is partially accurate",Half True,"August 22, 2019"
"Says Hitler said, ""This year will go down in history. For the first time, a civilized nation has full gun registration! Our streets will be safer, our police more efficient, and the world will follow our lead into the future!""","A recent Facebook post appears to forebode a dark future for the United States if it tightens gun laws by quoting Adolf Hitler on gun control in Germany. ""This year will go down in history,"" begins the Aug. 8 post. ""For the first time, a civilized nation has full gun registration! Our streets will be safer, our police more efficient, and the world will follow our lead into the future!"" The post attributes the statement to ""Adolph Hitler,"" misspelling the Nazi Party leader’s name before noting that he was remarking on the ""passing of the German Weapons Act 1935.""  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  When we reached out to several historians to find out if Hitler actually said this, they couldn’t tell us conclusively that he didn’t. But they were skeptical that the quote is authentic.  Richard Breitman, an American University professor emeritus who has written extensively on German history and the Holocaust, said he was ""unaware of any such statement by Hitler."" He also noted that in addition to Hitler’s misspelled name in the Facebook post, the basic Nazi law on weapons was issued in 1938, not 1935, as the post says. Peter Hayes, a Northwestern University professor who specializes in Nazi Germany and the Holocaust, offered a quick history lesson: A 1928 law that pre-dated the Nazi regime required people to seek state permission to buy or own a weapon and local police could revoke that permission at any time.  In 1931, the law was amended to require people seeking that permission to prove they needed a weapon.  In 1938, during Nazi rule, the law was changed so it was harder for Roma to have guns and easier for Nazis to carry them.  A separate decree in 1938 forbade Jews from having guns.  Maybe, Hayes said, the Facebook posts refers to another such a decree issued in 1935 but, ""I haven’t heard of it.""  He was also suspicious of the language used in the Facebook quote. ""Registration"" isn’t a typical term in German gun laws, he said.  Jeffrey Herf, a history professor at the University of Maryland, told us: ""My very strong suspicion is that this is a hoax."" Christopher Browning, a University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill professor emeritus who has researched and written extensively about Nazi Germany and the Holocaust, concurred. ""This sounds like a complete and total fabrication to me, invented for obvious reasons,"" he said.  A 2004 Fordham Law Review article called ""On Gun Registration, the NRA, Adolf Hitler, and Nazi Gun Laws: Exploding the Gun Culture Wars (A Call to Historians)"" notes that the ""infamous statement"" attributed to Hitler has been published more than 100 times in papers across the country and lawmakers have argued against gun registration in part because it supposedly enabled Hitler to leave people vulnerable to the Nazis",False,"August 21, 2019"

"In Australia ""they went and confiscated all the guns. You know who did what Australia did? Venezuela.""","U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., sparred with Fox News’ Jeanine Pirro about how to prevent guns from getting into the wrong hands. ""I’m here in Australia, congressman. They don’t have problems like this,"" Pirro said Aug. 10 following the mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton that killed 31 people. ""This is starting to be unfortunately a uniquely American situation. And I am a gun owner. I am a strong Second Amendment person, but some of the wrong people are getting their hands on guns."" Gaetz replied: ""Nobody would suggest that in the United States we would want Australia’s solution. There they went and confiscated all the guns. You know who did what Australia did? Venezuela. And now their people can't fight back when they are having to fight their way out of a socialist dictator."" But no one suggested taking away guns, Pirro responded, adding the Gaetz’s Venezuela comparison seemed ""a little off.""  So PolitiFact Florida wanted to look into it. The general point Gaetz was trying to make, his spokesman told us, was that he believes gun control failed in both Australia and Venezuela. He shared articles showing an Australian black market for guns, for example, as well as other news stories about Venezuela’s gun control laws leaving civilians and even police more vulnerable.  But there are several factual inaccuracies with his specific claim about Australia and the comparison to Venezuela. • Australia didn’t enact a total gun ban; it banned certain guns, including semi-automatics after a mass shooting in 1996.  • That’s different from what Venezuela’s government did in 2012 and 2013, when it took steps in an effort to stem the flow of guns. • In both countries, millions of guns remain in civilian hands. Gun deaths are a major problem in Venezuela. In 1996, a shooting in Tasmania left 35 dead. It was one of the most deadly civilian mass shootings in the world at the time. The conservative-led national government moved quickly to ban and destroy certain guns. Australia banned semi-automatic and self-loading rifles as well as shotguns. The government offered a one-year grace period during which it would buy back the firearms. After that, people possessing the weapons would be subject to strict penalties. The buyback program took in more than 640,000 prohibited weapons — roughly one-fifth of the country’s estimated guns. Today, Australians still legally own a high per-capita ratio of single-shot long guns, along with plenty of handguns, said Philip Alpers, founding director of Gunpolicy.org, a global project of the Sydney School of Public Health. But the number of legal and illegal guns dropped from about 3.2 million in 1996 to 2.5 million in 1997.  Since then, it has climbed back up to almost the same number as before the ban, though the rate of gun ownership is smaller today. In the 1980s and early 1990s, Australia suffered 14 mass shootings, which claimed 117 lives, Alpers said. Following the gun law changes, there were no mass shootings for many years. In June 2019, four people were killed by a gunman who used a banned gun. In 2018, seven were killed in a mass family homicide-suicide. What Venezuela did several years ago was not the same as Australia. The gun situation was not the same, for starters. In Australia, the government responded to a mass shooting. Venezuela faced a widespread problem with rampant gun violence and homicides — and it still does. In 2012, Venezuela imposed measures to ban possession of a gun in public places and to halt private gun sales to citizens.  In 2013, President Nicolas Maduro signed a disarmament bill that was intended to stem the flow of guns. The law created an automated system of registration for arms, parts, and ammunition under control of the armed forces. Individuals were allowed conditional possession, meaning that the state could take their gun.  Rebecca Hanson, an expert on crime in Venezuela and now a professor at the University of Florida, said she wouldn’t call the 2013 law a ""gun ban,"" because civilians could still own guns as long as they registered them. Also, guns remained widely available on the black market and enforcement was lax. ""The law, in reality, did not affect people's ability to access guns in any effective or long-term way,"" she said. Since the majority of guns are purchased on the black market, regulating the legal market does little to reduce gun sales in Venezuela, she said. Many of these guns end up flowing from state security forces and the military into the black market.  ""All of this is to say that even with the 2013 law, access to guns has increased,"" she said. Alejandro Velasco, New York University history professor of modern Latin America, told us that ""the gun ban had almost no practical impact on people’s ability to buy and keep (or use) weapons."" There are no solid numbers to pinpoint the number of guns in civilian ownership in Venezuela. Gunpolicy.org estimates that there were about 5.9 million privately owned guns in civilian hands in Venezuela  as of 2017, though the consultant that came up with it said it could be a wide range.  The opposition movement has billed itself as nonviolent for the most part, Velasco said. Several experts told us it’s not surprising that civilians don’t bring guns to protests where they face the armed government.  ""Even if the disarmament law had dramatically reduced gun ownership, which is not at all clear, armed anti-government civilians would stand no chance against the tanks and fighter jets of the army,"" said Dorothy Kronick, a University of Pennsylvania political scientist. Experts were critical of Gaetz using the problems in Venezuela to make any commentary on gun laws in the United States. ""Linking the issue of arms control with the struggle for democracy in the Venezuelan context only contributes to distort a situation that is already very distorted,"" Keymer Avila, a professor of criminology at the Central University of Venezuela said, ""increasing violence in an environment that is already very violent, and undermines an institution that is already very precarious."" Gaetz said in Australia ""they went and confiscated all the guns. You know who did what Australia did? Venezuela."" Gaetz’s claim about Australia is wrong, and his comparison to Venezuela is flawed. After a mass shooting in 1996, Australia banned semi-automatic and self-loading rifles as well as shotguns and offered a one-year buyback. It did not ban all guns. The number of civilian-owned guns is now nearly the same as before the 1996 law, although the rate of ownership is less. In Venezuela, the government instituted measures to try to limit the flow of guns to civilians. But experts said most guns are sold on the black market and that guns remain rampant in Venezuela. The idea that private gun owners could successfully challenge a national military is also unlikely",Mostly False,"August 19, 2019"

"""97% of murders occur with handguns.""","In the wake of mass shootings in California, Texas and Ohio, and continued summer violence in Chicago, Republican Congressman Adam Kinzinger has come out in favor of some gun restriction measures. Kinzinger represents Illinois’ 16th district, a 14-county area that wraps around Chicagoland from Wisconsin to Indiana. In February, he voted against a bipartisan House bill to expand background checks for gun purchases. Now, he is now advocating for universal background checks, along with laws to make it easier for authorities to take guns from unstable individuals, raise the legal age of purchase for all firearms to 21 and ban some large-capacity magazines. But he won’t yet go so far as to support a ban on assault-style weapons like the semi-automatic rifles used in recent mass shootings, a point he was asked to address in an interview with Fox 32’s Mike Flannery. ""Your Republican colleague, Rep. (Mike) Turner from the Dayton area, he’s now saying he's ready to vote for banning the assault rifles,"" said Flannery, referencing Dayton, Ohio, where a recent shooting left nine people dead. ""Is that an idea you’d consider?"" ""Not right now,"" Kinzinger responded. ""I mean, look, I think it’s like 97% of murders occur with handguns. That’s really where the big problem is."" Most murders are committed with firearms, a majority of them handguns, federal data show. Even so, Kinzinger significantly stretched the facts by claiming handguns are used to commit nearly all murders. To assess Kinzinger’s claim, we turned to data catalogued by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. In 2017, the latest year for which figures on murder weapons were available, handguns were used in 46% of all homicides — far from the 97% Kinzinger cited. We asked Kinzinger’s office to explain the discrepancy, but did not receive a response. If Kinzinger was referring to the share of firearm homicides that involve a handgun instead of murders overall, he would have gotten a little closer to the mark. However, those figures still fail to back up his claim. Firearms were used to commit 73% of all murders in 2017, FBI data show. And in at least 64% of those cases, the firearm was a handgun. In another 28% of murders committed with firearms, local police agencies did not specify the type used when reporting those cases to the FBI. But experts told us it’s reasonable to expect instances in which the firearm was not identified would likely follow the same pattern as those that were categorized. After adding nearly two-thirds of the unidentified cases reported in 2017 to the handgun category, the share of firearm murders committed with a handgun rises to 82%. That’s substantially higher, but still well below what Kinzinger claimed. In addition, we reviewed 10 years’ worth of FBI data and found the pattern held steady over time, something experts we spoke with also noted. ""That (97%) is too high a number,"" said David Hemenway, who directs the Harvard Injury Control Research Center. ""But to say that most people in the United States who are murdered are killed with guns and the large majority of people who are killed with guns are killed with handguns, that’s true every year."" As for Kinzinger’s assertion that handgun murders are ""the big problem,"" it is clear that handguns are far more commonly used in murders than assault-style rifles, or rifles in general. The FBI does not define assault weapons. But that doesn’t mean shootings committed with high-capacity semi-automatic firearms that allow a shooter to quickly kill many people in a short amount of time don’t pose serious problems for lawmakers to address. Indeed, much of Kinzinger’s recent proposal centers on the issue in response to the shootings in El Paso, Texas and Dayton, Ohio that left 31 people dead. ""If you said, I want to do one thing that reduces overall homicide in the United States, it would not be to ban assault weapons,"" Hemenway said. But addressing mass shootings requires lawmakers to consider policies not directly aimed at reducing total homicides, Hemenway added, including bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. Kinzinger claimed 97% of murders are committed with handguns. That figure is off-target. In 2017, 46% of all murders were committed with handguns, federal data show. Firearms were used in more than 70% of all homicides, however. And in at least two-thirds of those cases, the firearm was a handgun, making them by far the most common murder weapon",Mostly False,"August 15, 2019"
"Law-abiding gun owners stop crimes ""2.5 million times a year,"" according to the federal Centers for Disease Control.","Curt Schilling, a former Major League Baseball pitcher and former ESPN commentator known for controversial views, says he is considering a run for Congress in Arizona. The news quickly drew a cheer from President Donald Trump. Three days earlier, Schilling threw a fastball of a claim about guns that caught our attention. A TV reporter in Charlotte, N.C., had tweeted that an armed patron with a concealed carry permit shot two armed robbery suspects at a 7-Eleven, killing one of them. A sales manager for the U.S. Concealed Carry Association responded with a tweet saying, ""You mean to tell me a law-abiding, responsible gun owner actually DID stop crime?"" Schilling replied to that tweet with a reference to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, saying: ""Happens 2.5 million times a year per the CDC."" That’s actually not a count but an estimate, on the higher end, and it wasn’t done by the CDC. A spokesman for Cameo, a service Schilling promotes on his Twitter profile that pays him and other celebrities to create ""personalized video shoutouts"" for purchase, said he could not forward our request to Schilling for information that would back up his statement.  However, responding to a critic on Twitter, Schilling cited an opinion article on Forbes.com, which in turn references a 2013 report. The report was requested by the CDC, but was done by what is now known as the National Academy of Medicine, a federally chartered nonprofit.  The report did not produce its own estimates; rather, it cited estimates from studies. It also made clear that estimates vary widely. ""Defensive use of guns by crime victims is a common occurrence, although the exact number remains disputed,"" ranging from 108,000 to 3 million instances per year, the report stated.  Both the 3 million figure, and a 2.5 million figure mentioned in the report, stem from one gun researcher, Florida State University criminal justice professor Gary Kleck. Kleck said in an interview with PolitiFact that the 2.5 million comes not from the CDC but from a national survey he and Florida State colleague Marc Gertz did in 1993, asking a random sample of adults if they had used a gun in ""self-protection"" or in protection of property in the past year, and how they had used it.  So, that’s a survey that is 26 years old. The study estimated that Americans use guns for self-protection — that is, the person using the gun, though not necessarily firing it, believed that a crime, such as burglary or assault, was being committed — up to 2.5 million times per year. Kleck also provided us a 2018 article he wrote summarizing the findings of 20 other surveys that asked at least one question about defensive gun use. The ""implied number"" of defensive gun use incidents ranged from 600,000 to 6.1 million per year, according to the article.  Other gun researchers we contacted view Kleck’s 2.5 million estimate as extremely high.  Surveying people about events that rarely occur always produces overestimates, said Harvard University professor of health policy David Hemenway. The best survey of crime is the National Crime Victimization Survey, conducted by the U.S. Justice Department and the Census Bureau since 1973, Duke University professor of public policy studies Philip Cook told us. ""There are subtle differences"" between it and Kleck’s survey, in how questions about self-defense are asked, ""but the difference in the resulting estimate of how often guns are used in self-defense is huge,"" he said. In recent years, the NCVS-based estimate is less than 100,000 per year, Cook said. Both figures have their critics. The 2.5 million is ""not plausible given other information that is more trustworthy, such as the total number of U.S. residents who are injured or killed by guns each year,"" the RAND Corp. said in a 2018 analysis. ""At the other extreme, the NCVS ""almost certainly underestimates the true number."" Kleck criticized the NCVS estimates as ""wildly out of line"" with other estimates because its surveys only ask crime victims whether they tried to protect themselves, which means those who used a gun would have to ""volunteer"" that information. Schilling said law-abiding gun owners stop crimes ""2.5 million times a year,"" according to the federal Centers for Disease Control. The number of such instances is not known, and no estimate has been done by the CDC. A report requested by the CDC cites various studies, including one by a Florida State University gun researcher based on a 1993 survey which estimates that people use guns about 2.5 million times per year in self-defense, when they believe a crime is being committed.  That study did not try to determine whether the people in those instances were actual gun owners or whether they were law abiding during the incident. But the researcher says studies as recently as 2018 have produced estimates as high as 6.1 million. Other gun researchers, however, say 2.5 million is an extremely high estimate. They point to surveys that estimate about 100,000 such incidents per year.

Hodgkinson, who was angry with President Donald Trump and posted rants against Republicans online, was killed by police. In the weeks after, conservative lawmakers called to loosen gun restrictions. Republicans introduced legislation to allow lawmakers to almost always carry a concealed weapon and to allow concealed carry permits obtained in other states to be recognized in the District of Columbia, the New York Times then reported. Democrats opposed the measures. U.S. Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton, the House’s nonvoting member from D.C., said it ""is the last place you want to condone or allow concealed-carry weapons"" and ""they are certainly not going to be successful if I have anything to say about it.""  New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, and Rahm Emanuel, then Chicago’s mayor, among other Democrats, offered a resolution as part of the U.S. Conference of Mayors to oppose concealed carry bills.

She is an adult, though, not a little girl as the Facebook post suggests, and there is no evidence that she is a crisis actor, much less the daughter of a Trump appointee.  The first photo was published among others on The White House’s Instagram page on Aug. 7 with this caption: ""The President and First lady met with survivors and family members in Dayton, Ohio, this afternoon.""

"""If you go back, you can see Wayne LaPierre, who runs the NRA, testifying in front of Congress in favor of background checks 15 or 20 years ago.""","Billionaire and former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg took a familiar swipe at NRA chief executive Wayne LaPierre during an Aug. 11 interview on CBS’s ""Face the Nation.""

Numerous mass shootings have taken place since Trump’s election, including two in the span of 24 hours last weekend in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio. ""I think the NRA has been very badly hurt by this,"" Bloomberg said. ""Ninety percent of NRA members are in favor of background checks, so the NRA is not in the place of most of its members. And in fact, if you go back, you can see Wayne LaPierre, who runs the NRA, testifying before Congress in favor of background checks 15 or 20 years ago."" Related: ""Do majority of NRA members support background checks for guns?"" Bloomberg made almost the exact same claim about LaPierre’s testimony in 2013. Former President Barack Obama did, too.  It’s still accurate. We wanted to revisit the history in light of the NRA’s typically staunch resistance to gun control efforts and the Washington Post’s recent report that LaPierre called Trump to warn against pushing for background checks.  On May 27, 1999, a month after the Columbine High School shooting, LaPierre testified before the House Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Crime. LaPierre, also the chief executive at that time, listed a number of gun-related actions and laws the group believed would be ""reasonable."" Mandatory background checks for guns at gun shows was one. ""We think it's reasonable to provide mandatory instant criminal background checks for every sale at every gun show,"" he said. ""No loopholes anywhere for anyone.""  ""That means closing the Hinckley loophole so the records of those adjudicated mentally ill are in the system,"" he continued. ""This isn't new, or a change of position, or a concession. I've been on record on this point consistently, from our national meeting in Denver, to paid national ads and position papers, to news interviews and press appearances."" ""We think it’s reasonable to provide for instant gun checks at shows, just like at gun stores and pawn shops,"" LaPierre said, echoing a message at the heart of an NRA advertising campaign from that year.  In 2013, LaPierre and the NRA acknowledged the change in position. In a January Senate hearing that year — this time following a mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. — LaPierre was asked by Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., about his 1999 testimony on background checks. Leahy asked if the United States should ""have mandatory background checks at gun shows for sales of weapons."" ""Senator, I do not believe, the way the law is working now, unfortunately, that it does any good to extend the law to private sales between hobbyists and collectors,"" LaPierre said. In response to a follow-up, he added: ""We do not (support mandatory background checks at gun shows), because the fact is, the law right now is a failure the way it’s working."" Also in January 2013, NRA board member Sandy Froman told CNN, ""The NRA has changed its position, and the reason it's changed its position is because the system doesn't work."" Plus, on March 12, 2013, the NRA signaled its opposition to background checks on its website: ""The NRA opposes criminalizing private firearms transfers between law-abiding individuals, and therefore opposes an expansion of the background check system."" Bloomberg said, ""If you go back, you can see Wayne LaPierre, who runs the NRA, testifying before Congress in favor of background checks 15 or 20 years ago."" In 1999 testimony before Congress, LaPierre said, ""We think it's reasonable to provide mandatory instant criminal background checks for every sale at every gun show.""

"""Criminals don’t go through (gun) background checks. I think it’s like 3% go through a background check.""","Beefing up background checks on gun buyers won’t reduce crime, says Philip Van Cleave, a Virginia gun lobbyist. Van Cleave is president of the Virginia Citizens Defense League. During an Aug. 8 interview on WRVA Radio in Richmond, he was dismissive of calls for stronger background checks in the wake of fatal mass shootings this year in Virginia and other states. ""Criminals don’t go through background checks,"" he said. ""I think it’s like 3% go through a background check - 3%. Ninety-seven percent get the guns on the street."" We fact-checked Van Cleave’s claim.  Democrats in Virginia’s General Assembly and in Congress are calling for tighter background checks. Virginia and federal laws require all licensed gun dealers - those in the business of selling firearms - to run computerized checks to see if buyers have disqualifying criminal or mental health records. But gun sales between individuals not in the business - say, neighbors or hobbyists - are exempt. President Donald Trump has recently said he supports stronger background checks, but has not specified what changes he favors.  Van Cleave told us his 3% statistic comes from a 2016 survey of 24,848 state and federal prisoners by the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics. The bureau reported its findings in January 2019.  Of the inmates, 21% said they used or possessed a firearm while committing the crime that put them in prison, or about 5,200 of the sample, according to our calculation (the study did not break down its percentages into numbers of inmates). Of the prisoners who used or possessed a gun during the crime: Now, let’s focus on the 10% who bought their guns from a retailer. They’re important because the researchers identify them as the prisoners who were likely to have taken criminal background checks before they got their guns. Of that group of about 520 retail buyers, around 360 - or 69% - said they bought the gun using their own name. And about 350 of the retail buyers - or 67% - said they underwent a background check using their real name. (The survey doesn’t cite reasons why they passed the check, but perhaps they didn’t have criminal records at the time). Here’s another way of expressing the finding: About 350 of 5,200 inmates who possessed or used a gun during their crime - or 6.7% - said they went through a background check, using their real name.  Our ruling Van Cleave said, ""Criminals don’t go through (gun) background checks. I think it’s like 3% go through a background check."" He was referring to results from a 2016 survey of 24,848 state and federal inmates by the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics. About 5,200 of the prisoners said they possessed or used a firearm during their crime. Of that armed group, about 350 - or 6.7 percent - said they went through a background check to get the gun.

A long missive follows, but the gist is this: A video clip linked in the post ""proves the deep state is doing the shootings"" because a Fox News affiliate in El Paso announced another shooting that was supposed to happen at another WalMart before it happened. The post describes the actions of one of the TV station’s anchors and then launches into a massive conspiracy theory: ""She checks her Twitter and re-checks it, looks a little confused, and then says ‘that hasent (sic) happened yet. … Folks, this proves Twitter is in on the shootings, Fox News is in on the shootings, Wal Mart (sic) is in on the shootings ...

This is the shooting that led to the deaths of at least 22 people. Later that day, around 2:35 p.m. Mountain Daylight Time, Erika Castillo, one of the station’s anchors, said that ""an incident, as it was told to us, happened in the Walmart in Horizon (City)"" in El Paso County.  ""I’m not sure what time this tweet went out, however,"" she said, looking down at something on the desk before her. ""Okay, here it is, at 3 p.m. Well that’s, that hasn’t happened yet, so okay today is the 3rd—"" Another anchor interrupts her and says, ""This is 35 minutes ago."" The video that was posted on Facebook cuts off around then, but the full video shows that Castillo continued: ""So this just came out. Horizon Police Department said they just responded to a subject with a gun call at the Walmart in Horizon, and they were able to locate the individual and found he was open carrying and checked out okay and then the door was reopened."" We reached out to KFOX about the Facebook post but didn’t hear back. However, Castillo wasn’t describing a shooting that hadn’t happened yet. At 2 p.m. in both Horizon City and El Paso’s time zone of Mountain Daylight Time, the Horizon City Police Department tweeted: ""About an hour ago, HCPD responded to a subject with a gun call at our local Wal-Mart. The HCPD were able to locate the individual with and found he was open carrying and checked okay. The store has since reopened.""  If someone read the police department’s tweet from a city in a different time zone — say, Austin, Texas, which is on Central Time — the tweet’s timestamp would read as ""3 p.m."" That’s because the Twitter timestamp changes according to the time zone of the person viewing the tweet on Twitter.  Castillo explained in response to the video that the information she was reading from was a screen shot of a tweet that was made in a different time zone. ""I was looking at and trying to decipher an image grab of a tweet that had been made in east coast time,"" she said. ""El Paso is the only major city in Texas that sits on Mountain time.

No media was allowed. The White House provided video and photos. They show many smiles and handshakes as Trump met with people. We love you Dayton, Ohio! pic.twitter.com/IaCZAdyuzL Afterward, the hospital’s CEO told reporters the visit was meaningful and at times emotional. Controversy preceded Trump’s visit. At a vigil after the shooting that killed nine people, Republican Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine was shouted down by the crowd. The day before Trump came to Dayton, Mayor Whaley told reporters she was disappointed in Trump’s response to the shooting and wouldn’t discourage protestors who objected to his visit. Whaley and Brown greeted Trump at the Air Force base and accompanied him at the hospital. After he left, they took questions at Dayton City Hall. They spent the bulk of their time talking about gun policy. They said they asked Trump to support universal background checks, fund Medicaid mental health services and ban assault weapons. Brown downplayed the value of Trump giving awards to the police who stopped the killer. Brown suggested what he cast as a more substantive step. ""The most important thing you can do for these police officers is take these assault weapons off the streets so they don't have to go up against those assault weapons, and they need to take down a shooter,"" Brown said. Brown criticized Trump for using rhetoric that he said divides Americans and invites racial discord. And both of them said they expected little action to come from Trump to regulate firearms. Brown and Whaley said very little about Trump’s time with patients and others. By our count, they spoke about 1,800 words in the 14 minutes they spent with reporters. Out of that, they offered about 60 words describing the time Trump spent with citizens. Those words did not run afoul of Trump’s version of events. ""I think the victims and the first responders were grateful that the president of the United States came today,"" Whaley said. ""He was received as well as you can expect by the patients,"" Brown said. ""They are hurting. He was comforting, he and Melania did the right things. It's his job, in part, to comfort people. I'm glad he did it."" Viewers of the video can judge the tone of their remarks. Immediately after the news conference, the Associated Press reported, ""Ohio Democratic officials say they were gratified by President Donald Trump’s visit to the Dayton, the scene of a weekend mass shooting, and said Trump was treated respectfully, despite the fact some didn’t agree with his past rhetoric or policies."" The White House declined to comment. Trump said the remarks from Democrats Brown and Whaley misrepresented his visit with survivors, medical staff and first responders of the shooting in Dayton. He called their presentation ""a fraud."" Brown and Whaley said very little about Trump’s meeting, but what they said leaned toward the positive. Brown called Trump ""comforting,"" and said he was glad Trump had come. Whaley said people were grateful that the president had visited.

"Asked what his administration would be doing about ""the gun problem,"" said, ""We have done much more than most administrations. … We’ve done, actually, a lot.""","As a presidential candidate, Donald Trump accepted the endorsement of the National Rifle Association and released a Facebook video headlined by the remark, ""I won’t let them take away our guns!!"" Now, as president, he wants to be seen as a problem-solver on gun policy. At a media availability on Aug. 4 following mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, a reporter asked President Donald Trump, ""The gun problem – what are you going to do about it? How are you going to address it?"" Trump responded, ""We’re talking to a lot of people, and a lot of things are in the works, and a lot of good things. And we have done much more than most administrations. And it’s ... really not talked about very much, but we’ve done, actually, a lot. But perhaps more has to be done."" We wondered whether it’s accurate that Trump and his administration have ""done much more than most administrations"" to curb gun violence. We found that Trump has made two concrete moves that tightened gun policy and has taken additional actions on other aspects of curbing mass shootings. This is more than some of his predecessors have done. However, this tells only part of the story, because Trump and his administration have simultaneously advanced more policies that would expand gun rights or prevent efforts to limit gun rights. Trump has clearly acted to limit gun rights in two cases. • Using regulatory powers to bypass Congress, Trump in 2018 acted to ban bump stocks, an accessory that uses recoil to effectively turn a semi-automatic rifle into a fully automatic one. This technique was used by the shooter who killed 58 people and injured almost 900 attending a music festival in Las Vegas in 2017. • Trump signed a large federal spending bill that included language to strengthen the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS. The legislation had received bipartisan support in Congress. In addition, under Trump, the federal government has increased prosecutions of firearms offenses. (See our fact-check.) The Trump campaign said he deserves credit for actions beyond the scope of guns specifically. They cited his signing of the STOP School Violence Act, which authorizes more than $1 billion in grant funding through 2028 to support violence-prevention programs in schools. The campaign also pointed to Trump’s establishment of the Federal Commission on School Safety. (The commission released a final report in December 2018.) Still, the Trump administration’s gun-specific efforts have tended to focus on expanding gun rights or opposing tighter limits on them. Some examples: • He signed legislation to overturn a rule enacted under President Barack Obama that made it harder for some mentally ill people to obtain guns. (Advocates for disabled Americans and civil-liberties groups joined with gun advocates in supporting Trump’s action.) • Trump in 2019 threatened to veto bills passed by the House to require federal background checks for all gun sales. (A veto has not been necessary since the measures remain stalled in the Senate.) • Trump’s Interior Department reversed a ban on hunting with lead ammunition in national parks and other federal lands. • Trump’s Interior Department formally proposed a rule to expand hunting on federal lands. • Trump’s Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives delayed an Obama-era rule to make gun-safety devices more readily available where firearms are sold. • Trump’s Justice Department formally sided with plaintiffs seeking to overturn New York City restrictions on transporting handguns at the Supreme Court. So, for Trump to focus solely on his efforts to limit gun rights ignores the more numerous examples in which he has sought to expand gun rights or prevent restrictions of gun rights. ""The Trump administration has been mostly missing in action on enhanced gun control,"" said Harold (Jay) Corzine, a sociologist at the University of Central Florida. The universe of comparable presidents is actually pretty small. In the past 50 years, only two presidents — Bill Clinton and Obama, both Democrats — made tightening gun policies a significant item on their policy agendas.  In 1993, Clinton signed the Brady Bill, which heightened requirements for background checks, and the following year, he signed the assault weapons ban, which sunsetted after 10 years in 2004.  Obama, for his part, pursued gun control policies, especially after the 2012 shooting at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn. But facing a Republican-controlled Congress opposed to gun control, such efforts went nowhere. Instead, between 2013 and 2016, Obama undertook executive actions on mental health treatment, strengthened background checks, restarting federal gun research that had been frozen for years, funding additional federal agents, tracing guns found during investigations to determine trafficking patterns, and guiding U.S. attorneys to go after felons looking to buy guns or people lying in order to pass background checks. ""Trump has not had a pro-control record, although most previous presidents have not done much more"" than he has, said Florida State University criminologist Gary Kleck. However, experts caution against a direct comparison between Obama’s record and Trump’s. ""During Obama's administration, there were at least four bills to close the ‘gun show loophole,’ two attempts to renew the assault weapons ban, two attempts to ban high-capacity magazines, two to ban ‘build them yourself’ assault rifle kits, and one to ban imported assault weapons,"" said Jaclyn Schildkraut, an associate professor of criminal justice at the State University of New York at Oswego. ""Every single one of these 11 bills died on the floor of either the House or Senate, so it was never an option for Obama to sign them into law."" Given that Republicans — the more consistently pro-gun party — have controlled either the presidency or at least one chamber of Congress for most of the past quarter-century, ""it’s not really surprising that more restrictions have not been passed at the federal level,"" Schildkraut said. Asked what his administration would be doing about ""the gun problem,"" Trump said, ""We have done much more than most administrations. … We’ve done, actually, a lot."" Trump has banned bump stocks, supported a bipartisan effort to improve the background-check database, and prioritized gun-related prosecutions. This number does compare favorably to what some other recent presidents have accomplished.

We're talking about 5 to 10 million assault weapons in the hands of private citizens.""","The United States doesn’t require gun registration. So, when U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., claims private citizens have more assault weapons than members of the military do, how does he know? ""There are more assault rifles, as I understand it, in the hands of private citizens than in the hands of the United States military,"" the 2020 presidential candidate said in the wake of the back-to-back mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio. ""We're talking about 5 (million) to 10 million assault weapons in the hands of private citizens."" Sanders’ claim suffers a bit from comparing private and military weapons, which are different. Plus, he has to rely on wildly varying estimates, although his seems on the lower end.  We’ll sort out the facts for you.  In both shootings, assault-style weapons, legal in both states, were used. Each weapon was semiautomatic — the gunmen could fire as quickly as they could pull the trigger — and carrying enough ammunition to potentially kill dozens of people in minutes.  The New York Times reported that the El Paso shooter used a semi-automatic Kalashnikov-style rifle (also known as an AK-47-style rifle), which typically uses a magazine that has 30 rounds; and that the Dayton shooter used an AR-15-style pistol, modified to act as a rifle, with a drum magazine that can hold up to 100 rounds.  We’ll note that ""assault weapon"" does not have a universal definition. For example, a bill called the Assault Weapons Ban of 2018 defined an assault weapon differently than the federal law that banned assault weapons from 1994 to 2004, before expiring.  ""None of the so-called ‘assault rifles’ legally owned by U.S. civilians are assault rifles as the term is used in military contexts,"" said Florida State University criminal justice professor emeritus Gary Kleck, who has done research on large-capacity firearms used by mass shooters. ""Assault rifles used by members of the military can all fire full automatic, like machine guns, as well as one shot at a time, whereas none of the so-called ‘assault rifles’ legally owned by U.S. civilians can fire full automatic."" But Kleck agreed that semiautomatic weapons evolved from earlier military weapons, many look like military weapons, and they can kill people rapidly. Sanders campaign policy director Josh Orton acknowledged to us that the precise number of a particular type of weapon in civilian hands is not known, given there is no national gun registration. In fact, federal law prohibits there being a national registry. But Orton argued that Sanders’ figure of 5-10 million of semiautomatic rifles, such as the AR-15, is a conservative estimate. He cited a 2016 CNBC news article that quoted the National Rifle Association as saying there were 5 million AR-15s in circulation; he also cited other data suggesting the figure could be much higher.  Harvard University gun researcher Deborah Azrael told us that her latest survey of gun owners showed there were about 90 million rifles in private hands in the United States in 2015. The survey did not ask about about AR-15s, but 5-10 million is plausible, said she and her colleague on the survey, Matthew Miller of Northeastern University. As recently as June 2019, the NRA called a reported figure of more than 11 million AR-15s ""an arguably lowball figure.""  Gun researchers including Kleck, Miller and Philip Cook of Duke University, cautioned us on relying on estimates made by the NRA or the National Shooting Sports Foundation, the firearms industry’s trade association. Those figures could be inflated with the aim of making assault-style weapons appear common.  ""The fact is, we just don’t know"" the actual number, Miller said. Aaron Karp, a senior consultant to the Small Arms Survey and a political science lecturer at Old Dominion University in Virginia, told us he believes Sanders’ estimate for private citizens is ""very conservative.""  Karp estimates there are 15 million to 20 million assault-style weapons in the hands of Americans. Gun researchers we consulted told us they are not aware of any counts of assault-style weapons held by members of the military. Sanders’ campaign pointed us to an estimate of 4.5 million from the Small Arms Survey, an independent research project based in Geneva, Switzerland. That is for all U.S. military-owned firearms, not assault-style weapons. But it would be exceeded by the estimated 5 million or more assault-style weapons in private hands. Sanders said: ""There are more assault rifles, as I understand it, in the hands of private citizens than in the hands of the United States military. We're talking about 5 (million) to 10 million assault weapons in the hands of private citizens."" There are no official counts of assault-style weapons, either in private hands or in the U.S. military. But estimates that the civilian figure could be 5 million or more appear to be conservative and would exceed the estimated number of all weapons in the military. At the same time, those are semiautomatic weapons, not fully automatic like those used in the military",Half True,"August 8, 2019"
"""Chicago experienced its deadliest weekend of the year...With 7 dead and 52 wounded near a playground.""","Over the weekend, mass shootings in El Paso, Texas and Dayton, Ohio left 31 dead and dozens more wounded. Additionally, the city of Chicago experienced yet another bloody summer weekend of gun violence. As President Donald Trump came under intense criticism for his divisive rhetoric in the wake of the mass shootings, his daughter Ivanka took to Twitter to express concern about unrelated shootings in Chicago.  ""As we grieve over the evil mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton, let us not overlook that Chicago experienced its deadliest weekend of the year,"" she tweeted. ""With 7 dead and 52 wounded near a playground in the Windy City—and little national outrage or media coverage—we mustn’t become numb to the violence faced by inner city communities every day."" With 7 dead and 52 wounded near a playground in the Windy City- and little national outrage or media coverage- we mustn’t become numb to the violence faced by inner city communities every day. At a press conference on Tuesday afternoon, both Mayor Lori Lightfoot and Chicago Police Department Superintendent Eddie Johnson swiftly condemned the first daughter’s statements as ""wrong"" and ""misleading."" But what part of these tweets was incorrect, and how did Trump get the story mixed up? We took a closer look to find out.  As Lightfoot and Johnson pointed out at Tuesday’s press conference, the tweets imply that the victims all came from a single shooting incident. In reality, those numbers represent citywide statistics for gun casualties that occurred between Friday, August 2 and Sunday, August 4.  ""She said seven killed and 52 shot near a playground. That’s not what happened,"" Johnson said. ""She’s conflating the whole weekend activity into one incident."" One shooting that left seven injured did occur near a playground in Douglas Park during the early morning hours on Sunday, as the Sun-Times pointed out. But the rest of the victims sustained gunshot wounds from many other isolated shooting incidents around the city.   According to CPD Spokesman Anthony Guglielmi, Trump was also wrong in saying that last weekend was the deadliest weekend of 2019 for Chicago, although it was the most violent weekend in terms of total shooting victims. Data collected by the Sun-Times shows that gun violence left nine dead after a weekend in mid-July and eight dead in early June.  While news of the violence here in Chicago certainly took a backseat to the mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton nationally, Trump mischaracterized the situation by saying there was ""little national outrage or media coverage."" The outbreak of gun violence was front-page news in the Chicago Tribune and the Sun-Times, and it even found its way into Monday’s issue of The New York Times.  After angrily lamenting Trump’s dissemination of misleading information—the original post got over 35,000 likes and 8,000 retweets on Twitter—Lightfoot took the occasion as an opportunity to explain what a healthy partnership between Chicago and the federal government might look like.  ""That’s the danger of trying to govern via Tweet,"" the mayor said. ""If they want to help, they should actually call us and ask for specifics, which we’d be happy to share, and we would offer them specific ways in which the federal government can actually partner with us to help address the issue of violent crime.""  While Trump failed to issue a formal retraction or correction, the White House did release a statement regarding the situation following Lightfoot’s comments.  ""Ivanka has appreciated getting to know Mayor Lightfoot, respects her commitment to addressing this issue and looks forward to continuing the conversation around this issue, workforce development and economic opportunity for all,"" the White House said. ""To the extent that her quote was misleading in implying that all of the shooting incidents occurred in one location, it remains important to note that there were 7 deaths and 52 wounded across the city, resulting in one of the deadliest weekends in the city this year."" Still, the mayor emphasized the importance of communication in getting the facts right the first time, especially when those facts involve sensitive issues like gun violence.  ""It’s important when we’re talking about people’s lives to actually get the facts correct, which one could easily do if you actually cared about getting it right,"" she said.  Ivanka Trump tweeted ""that Chicago experienced its deadliest weekend of the year...With 7 dead and 52 wounded near a playground."" Only seven of the wounded were shot in an incident that occurred near a playground in Douglas Park. Last weekend also was not the deadliest weekend of the year in Chicago, according to data from CPD.  As a result, Trump severely misstated the gun violence situation in Chicago during the first weekend of August",Mostly False,"August 7, 2019"
"Says Walmart is ""one of the largest sellers of assault-style weapons.""","On the heels of a pair of mass shootings, MSNBC anchor Stephanie Ruhle asked a gun control activist how big businesses could contribute to curbing gun violence. Ruhle homed in on Walmart, one of the nation’s largest retailers and the site of the attack in El Paso, Texas, which left at least 22 people dead and dozens more wounded. ""Walmart is America,"" Ruhle said in the Aug. 5 interview. ""Walmart is the largest employer in the United States, one of the largest sellers of assault-style weapons.""  It’s true that Walmart is the largest private employer in the United States, but the retailer does not sell assault-style weapons. In fact, the company banned the sale of assault-style rifles in its stores in 2015. Ruhle’s use of the term ""assault-style weapons"" could lead to some confusion, since there’s no universal definition for it. Generally, people on both sides of the gun debate agree that fully automatic weapons, which are heavily regulated, should be considered assault weapons. (Fully automatic weapons are subject to strict regulations that make them difficult for civilian buyers to purchase.) But there’s disagreement over semi-automatic rifles, which have been used in several mass shootings. When a now-expired ban taking on ""semi-automatic assault weapons"" passed in 1994, the Justice Department said, ""In general, assault weapons are semi-automatic firearms with a large magazine of ammunition that were designed and configured for rapid fire and combat use,"" according to CNN. Several big-box retailers currently sell semi-automatic rifles. Walmart just isn’t one of them. Walmart still sells some firearms and ammunition, as part of its long and complex history with guns. But it has ended the sale of weapons that could be considered assault-style. Walmart has said its current gun sales policy will not change following the two recent mass shootings, meaning the company will continue selling certain firearms despite calls to drop gun sales entirely. But Walmart has taken some steps over the last several years to refine that policy. Those steps included ending the sale of assault rifles in 2015, a decision the company attributed to low consumer demand, not calls for gun control, according to the New York Times.  ""We stopped selling assault-style weapons in 2015,"" Walmart spokesman Randy Hargrove told PolitiFact. ""We have a longstanding commitment to selling firearms safely and compliantly."" It is accurate that Walmart is one of the largest sellers of firearms and ammunition in the United States, Hargrove said. He noted the company sells guns in roughly half of its 4,700 U.S. stores and not, for example, in its ‘neighborhood market’ stores, where the focus is on groceries.  In 2018, Walmart removed some airsoft guns, toys and other items from its website that resemble assault-style rifles, Hargrove said. It also raised the age limit on gun purchases to 21. The company has also said it only sells handguns in its Alaska stores, and in July, it stopped selling all guns in New Mexico after the state broadened its law on background checks. Dick’s Sporting Goods decided to stop selling assault-style rifles in 2018, as well. According to CNN, Bass Pro Shops still sells semi-automatic rifles, and its subsidiary Cabela’s offers what its website refers to as ""semi-automatic tactical rifles."" Gander Outdoors also lists ""semi-auto action"" firearms on its website. Other online retailers sell semi-automatic rifles, too. MSNBC did not respond to a request for comment. Ruhle said Walmart is ""one of the largest sellers of assault-style weapons."" Walmart does not sell automatic weapons, and it stopped selling semi-automatic rifles in 2015",False,"August 7, 2019"
"""After (the assault weapon ban) passed in 1994, there was a big drop in mass shooting deaths. When the ban expired, they rose again.""","It is one of the most controversial gun control policies: A ban on assault weapons and large capacity magazines that allow shooters to keep firing longer without reloading. While defining what is and isn’t an assault weapon is hard, singling out the broad class of firearms the term conveys is not. Following the mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, former President Bill Clinton invoked the ban that passed on his watch. ""How many more people have to die before we reinstate the assault weapons ban and the limit on high-capacity magazines and pass universal background checks?"" Clinton tweeted Aug. 5. ""After they passed in 1994, there was a big drop in mass shooting deaths. When the ban expired, they rose again. We must act now."" How many more people have to die before we reinstate the assault weapons ban & the limit on high-capacity magazines & pass universal background checks? After they passed in 1994, there was a big drop in mass shooting deaths. When the ban expired, they rose again. We must act now. Clinton touched back on the trend in an op-ed for Time on Aug. 8. So we wanted to check it out. We’ve dug into the general question of the impact of the 1994 law before. This is the first time we examine its specific tie to mass shooting deaths, and whether the death toll rose after the ban ended. (Clinton’s tweet assumes that the presence or absence of the ban changed the number of mass shooting deaths. Proving cause and effect is a heavy lift.) The topic is riddled with tough data challenges. The law banned only certain types of semi-automatic firearms along with magazines holding more than 10 rounds of ammunition. Should rampages using other kinds of assault-style weapons count? Plus, mass shootings happen much less frequently than other gun crimes, which puts any scientific analysis at a disadvantage. That said, the evidence shows that mass shooting deaths rose in the years after the ban. The drop during the ban is less clear cut. The impact of the law is debated, but some researchers say that data and logic show that limits on large capacity magazines and assault weapons help reduce fatalities. The 1994 law barred the ""manufacture, transfer, and possession"" of about 118 firearm models and all magazines holding over 10 rounds. People who owned such weaponry could keep it. When the ban took effect, there were roughly 1 million assault weapons in private hands. An estimated 25 million weapons were equipped with large capacity magazines. The ban expired in 2004. In a key 2004 study commissioned by the U.S. Justice Department, researcher Christopher Koper wrote, ""The ban’s exemption of millions of pre-ban assault weapons and large capacity magazines ensured that the effects of the law would occur only gradually."" ""Should it be renewed, the ban’s effects on gun violence are likely to be small at best and perhaps too small for reliable measurement,"" Koper wrote. Clinton’s office cited a 2019 study from New York University’s School of Medicine. A group led by epidemiologist Charles DiMaggio homed in on mass shooting deaths. (Other research has tracked the number of times mass shootings happened, which is not the same thing.) Researchers define mass shootings in different ways. Following the FBI’s definition, DiMaggio’s group looked at incidents where at least four people died. In raw numbers, they found that mass shooting deaths fell during the years of the ban, and rose afterwards. DiMaggio shared his data.  ""During the ban period, there were fewer bodies,"" DiMaggio said. The death toll from mass shootings went from 4.8 per year during the ban years to 23.8 per year afterwards. Many factors drive gun deaths. To help account for those, DiMaggio’s team put mass shooting deaths in terms of the total number of firearm homicides. Viewed that way, they found that between 1994 and 2004, the yearly rate fell by 7-9 people per 10,000 firearm homicides.  There’s room for debate over what happened to death rates, in contrast to raw numbers, before and during the ban.  ""There is some evidence they actually declined — or at least didn’t continue to increase during the period of the ban,"" DiMaggio said. Epidemiologists speak in terms of risk; that is, the odds of something bad happening. DiMaggio’s study concluded that mass shooting deaths were 70% less likely during the ban.  On the key policy question of whether the ban drove the decline, DiMaggio urges caution. ""It is pretty much impossible to prove cause and effect,"" he said. That’s the consensus among a number of researchers. Philip Cook at Duke University said the death toll is real, but complicated. ""Violence rates were quite volatile during that period generally for reasons that had nothing to do with gun regulation,"" Cook said. ""That doesn’t mean that the ban was ineffective — only that we don’t know and probably cannot determine the answer given that the outcome of interest (mass shootings) is so rare.""  The drop of 15 mass shooting deaths from before the ban to during it is a slender difference on which to base firm conclusions. Economist Rosanna Smart at RAND, a consulting nonprofit research group, agreed that mass shootings rose after the ban ended, but noted, ""I don’t think (DiMaggio’s) methods are well-suited for determining the causal impact of the assault weapons ban."" In a 2018 article, Smart reviewed two studies on the impact of the ban. She said strictly in terms of statistical methods, the results were ""inconclusive."" Although one report did find that state-level bans were effective at reducing mass shooting death rates. The debate over the value of a ban on assault weapons and large capacity magazines often includes Christopher Koper at George Mason University. Koper wrote the 2004 study that gave both sides in the gun control debate material to lean on. Recently, Koper has spent more time assessing the role of large capacity magazines that hold more than 10 rounds.  In an article, Koper wrote that more than the semiautomatic weapons themselves, the latest data ties the larger magazines to a rising death toll. ""Considering that mass shootings with high capacity semiautomatics are considerably more lethal and injurious than other mass shootings, it is reasonable to argue that the federal ban could have prevented some of the recent increase in persons killed and injured in mass shootings had it remained in place,"" Koper wrote in an article to be published in a few months. Democrats introduced a legislation to block people from buying large capacity magazines. Semiautomatic rifles account for a small percentage of deaths, but there are a lot of them. According to the industry trade group National Shooting Sports Foundation, yearly sales averaged about 200,000 during the years of the ban. In the eight years after the ban ended, sales averaged about 700,000 a year. Clinton urged lawmakers to reinstate a ban on assault weapons and high capacity magazines. ""After they passed in 1994, there was a big drop in mass shooting deaths. When the ban expired, they rose again,"" he said. Clinton spoke too strongly about the drop. In simple numbers, mass shooting deaths fell during the ban years —15 deaths over the course of the decade. But statistically, that number is too small to allow strong conclusions. Even the author of the report Clinton relied on said the death rate might have declined —or levelled off. The rise after the ban expired is supported by the evidence, although definitions of mass shootings will vary. The role of the ban remains unclear, but Clinton’s statement did not specifically say that the ban was the key factor. Clinton exaggerated the decline but was right about the rise",Half True,"August 7, 2019"
"There are ""more gun deaths by far"" in the United States than any other country in the world.","Following the recent mass shootings in Gilroy, California and El Paso, Texas, and just hours before a separate mass shooting in Dayton, Ohio, California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein made a sweeping statement about the number of guns and gun deaths in America.  ""There are more guns in this country than people, and more per capita than any other country in the world. And there are more gun deaths by far,"" Feinstein, a strong advocate for gun control, said on Twitter on Aug. 3, 2019. ""I continue to hope that opponents of commonsense gun reform laws will come to their senses and join the effort to save lives.""  Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-CA, posted this tweet on Aug. 3, 2019. As of early this week, 22 people were killed in the El Paso shooting, nine in Dayton and three in Gilroy. The suspected gunmen in Dayton and Gilroy also died.  We examined each part of Feinstein’s statement, but found we couldn’t place a Truth-O-Meter rating on the first two parts because there’s no official count on the number of guns in America and there are competing estimates on how many exist.  We did place a rating on the last portion about America having ""more gun deaths by far"" than any other country.  We’ll provide analysis on each piece of Feinstein’s statement below.  Feinstein on guns First, here’s some background on the senator. In 1994, she authored the Federal Assault Weapons Ban, which was signed by President Bill Clinton. It prohibited the manufacture of 19 specific kinds of military-style, semi-automatic firearms, often called assault weapons. It also banned the manufacture and sale of gun magazines that hold more than 10 bullets. The bill expired in 2004 after efforts to extend it failed in Congress. Its restrictions did not apply to any semi-automatic weapons or magazines made before the ban’s effective date: Sept. 13, 1994. Feinstein has remained an advocate for gun control. In February of this year, she introduced a bill that would pay for states to create their own extreme-risk protection laws, also known as red flag laws. Those would allow family members to petition for a court order to ""grant law enforcement the authority to temporarily take weapons from dangerous individuals who present a threat to themselves or others,"" according to Feinstein’s office.  California, Maryland and Florida have already enacted similar laws. There is no official count of the number of firearms in the United States, only widely varying estimates, as PolitiFact has reported in the past.  As the Pew Research Center has observed: ""Gun ownership is one of the hardest things for researchers to pin down."" We found estimates as low as 265 million civilian guns in the U.S. in January 2015 — to as high as 393 million in a report last year. Researchers say estimates can include guns that no longer work, leading to an overcount. Meanwhile, some survey respondents will understate the number of guns they own, leading to an undercount.  With no definitive tally, we decided not to place a rating on this portion of Feinstein's statement. This second part of the claim is generally on the right track, whether looking at the high estimates for guns in America or the lower ones. But again it relies on a topic for which there’s no settled data.  Taking the estimate of 393 million civilian firearms, there would be 120.5 guns for every 100 residents in the United States. As The Washington Post reported, that’s twice the per capita rate of the next-highest nation, Yemen, with just 52.8 guns per 100 residents.  Using the lower estimate of 265 million guns in 2015 would still produce about 83 guns for every 100 Americans that year.  While this part of Feinstein’s claim is likely more accurate, the per capita rate doesn’t mean all Americans own guns. Instead, gun ownership is concentrated among a minority of the US population — as surveys from the Pew Research Center and General Social Survey suggest, according to the Post.  This part of Feinstein’s statement is not supported. We found the United States experiences more firearm injury deaths than other countries of similar socioeconomic standing. But that’s not what Feinstein claimed. She suggested it had ""more gun deaths by far"" than any other country. In 2017, Brazil had the most overall gun deaths of any country at 48,493, including homicides, suicides and unintentional gun deaths, according to a June 2018 report by the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.  The United States had the second most overall gun deaths at 40,229, though it had the highest suicide by gun total of any nation, at nearly 25,000. Data from the report showed Brazil had the most overall gun deaths at least from 2015 through 2017. ""Yes, Brazil is highest by number"" for overall gun deaths, the study’s author, Professor Moshen Naghavi, said by email.  ""We believe 2018 and 2019 will be higher,"" Naghavi said in a follow-up phone interview, citing decisions made by Brazil’s new president to make firearms more accessible.  Feinstein’s office did not respond to our request for information supporting this portion of her statement.  PolitiFact Texas fact-checked a similar claim last week by former Rep. Beto O’Rourke and rated it Mostly False. O'Rourke said at the Democratic presidential debate in Detroit that ""we lose nearly 40,000 people in this country to gun violence, a number that no other country comes even close to."" It cited the University of Washington study and noted that more than a dozen countries had more firearm deaths per capita than the United States in 2016. Our rating Sen. Dianne Feinstein claimed, ""There are more guns in this country than people, and more per capita than any other country in the world. And there are more gun deaths by far.""  We could not place a rating on the first two parts because there is no official count of guns in America, only widely varying estimates.  The last part of her statement, however, is not supported. A recent study showed Brazil, not the United States, had the most overall gun deaths of any country over the last several years. America, however, had the highest total of suicides by firearm of any nation.  In the end, she was wrong that there are ""more gun deaths by far"" in the United States than any other country in the world",False,"August 6, 2019"
"""Less mass shootings under Trump!""","On Aug. 3, 2019, a gunman walked into a packed Walmart in El Paso, Texas, and opened fire, killing at least 22 and injuring 24. In the wee hours of Aug. 4, a gunman opened fire on the street in a Dayton, Ohio, entertainment district, killing nine and injuring 27. Later that day, Wisconsin state Rep. Ron Tusler was on Facebook claiming mass shootings are down under President Donald Trump. ""Less mass shootings under Trump! His base doesn't hate anyone,"" declared Tusler, R-Harrison, in a since-deleted post. The text accompanied a re-posting of a chart shared by another person that showed 24 mass shootings under President Barack Obama and four shootings under Trump. That’s quite the disparity.   There’s a lot to cover — and a lot wrong — in this seemingly simple claim. Let’s break it down. Tusler’s claim is ridiculous on multiple fronts. For one, the data it references is badly outdated. The chart in Tusler’s post is pulled from a Spring 2018 article in National Affairs, a quarterly journal from the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. RELATED: Fact-checking misinformation after the El Paso, Dayton shootings The chart says it pulled the tallies for each president from an LA Times timeline published in October 2017, then added the February 2018 Marjory Stoneman school shooting in Parkland, Fla. So the data at best ends a year and a half ago, reflecting less than half of Trump’s time in office to date. The chart itself is flawed as well. Converting the LA Times narratives to a chart implies a degree of consistency and comprehensiveness that the newspaper did not intend. The article didn’t define any criteria for inclusion aside from a sentence at the top saying, ""Here are some of the most notable mass shootings in the U.S. in recent decades."" The National Affairs chart is particularly haphazard since it added in the Florida shooting but ignored the Texas First Baptist Church massacre in November 2017 that killed more people. The broader issue with both the chart and Tusler’s claim is the use of raw numbers to compare one partial term under Trump to two full terms under Obama. Simple tallies will, of course, be larger over a longer time period. So what are those tallies? And how does Tusler’s claim about less shootings hold up to a better comparison, such as mass shootings per year? Those answers depend on how you define a mass shooting. Though bandied about in politics, media and culture, there is no universally accepted definition of the term.  The U.S. Justice Department defines it as three or more killings in a single episode. The Washington Post database uses four or more shot and killed in a single incident, excluding gang-related killings. Mother Jones uses three or more shot and killed. The much broader Gun Violence Archive uses four or more shot (not necessarily killed). None include the perpetrator in those tallies. We turned to the Washington Post and Mother Jones, since both have been tracking this subject in detail and have data going back several presidential administrations. We find a trend line that doesn’t match up with particular presidents or party control, it simply shows a steady increase in shootings over time.   Our analysis of The Washington Post data shows an average of 2.4 mass shootings per year under President Ronald Reagan, 2.3 under George H. W. Bush and 3.6 under both Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. The rate jumps to 5.1 per year under Obama and 7.9 per year so far under Trump — a roughly 50% increase. In terms of raw numbers, that’s 41 shootings in the eight years Obama was in office, compared to 20 already in the two and a half under Trump. The data from Mother Jones shows a similar trend, though the numbers are different since they have a broader definition of mass shootings and aren’t as comprehensive as the Post in prior years. Mother Jones reports 1 to 2 shootings per year from the Reagan era through George W. Bush, then 4.8 under Obama and 11.5 under Trump. (The Gun Violence Archive doesn’t shed much light on this claim since it only goes back to 2014.) We asked Tusler if he was aware the data was outdated, and whether he felt raw numbers were a fair way to compare Trump and Obama. ""If there is newer data, please provide it and I would update. I prefer the most up to date information,"" he said in a Facebook message. ""I don't think raw numbers tell the whole story. But, at least they are not interpreted with a bias."" It’s an ironic response given that it’s the use of raw numbers that paints a skewed picture of the Trump and Obama eras. Doing an annual average equalizes the comparison. Tusler said he thought the data was more recent and had removed the post from Facebook, though it remained until this fact check published. In the wake of two mass shootings that left 31 dead in the span of 13 hours, Tusler claimed there have been fewer such shootings under Trump than Obama. That’s nonsense. The chart Tusler based his claim on is both incomplete and outdated — including only half of Trump’s time in office. And it’s absurd to use a raw tally of shootings to compare just over two years under Trump to eight years under Obama. Using more comprehensive data and a reasonable criterion like shootings per year, we see that mass shootings have risen steadily in recent decades regardless of who is in the White House.  So shootings are up — not down — under Trump",False Pants on Fire,"August 6, 2019"

On Feb. 23, 2014, the Hartford Courant ran the obit featured in the Facebook post. It says that Betts was born in Hartford, Conn., and lived in Suffield, Conn., before he died on Feb. 19, 2014. He graduated from Suffield High School in 2010 and then attended Lincoln Tech for Diesel Technology. He worked at Folsom Construction.  The Courant reported that Betts and the owner of Folsom Construction died after a dump truck bed hit overhead electrical wires and they were electrocuted. The Dayton shooting suspect, meanwhile, was raised in Bellbrook, a Dayton, Ohio, suburb, and he attended Bellbrook High School. Media reports have quoted former classmates, an ex-girlfriend and a former Bellbrook principal about Betts. More recently, he had been studying psychology at a local community college and worked at a Chipotle restaurant, the Washington Post reported.  The obituary in the Facebook post is for Connor D. Betts, but the Dayton shooting suspect’s middle name was Stephen.  The obit for Connor D. Betts said he was survived by his mother, Kathleen O’Leary Betts, and his father, Robert Betts. The parents of Connor Stephen Betts, the Dayton shooting suspect, are named Moira Betts and Stephen Betts.  Photos of Connor D. Betts and Connor Stephen Betts bear a resemblance; both men had brown hair, for example. But a closer look at the images shows that they are clearly different people.

"""Last year, we prosecuted a record number of firearms offenses.""","After weekend mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton left more than 31 people dead, President Donald Trump gave a speech at the White House blaming mental illness and hatred for the attacks. Trump offered few specifics related to potential gun legislation he would support, although he left open the door when he said he was ""ready to listen and discuss all ideas that will actually work and make a very big difference."" Trump briefly spoke about what the federal government has already done to crack down on guns. ""Last year, we prosecuted a record number of firearms offenses, but there is so much more that we have to do,"" he said Aug 5. Is that true? Let’s find out.  Trump was citing data from the U.S. Department of Justice, which tracks federal prosecutions of firearm offenses. In October 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice announced that it had ""smashed records"" by charging more than 15,300 defendants with federal firearms offenses, 17 percent more than the previous record. The press release from the Justice Department didn’t cite the year or number for the previous record, and we were unable to reach a Justice spokesperson by deadline.  However, annual statistics from the Justice Department show criminal cases in which defendants were charged under a couple of key firearm statutes. That data shows there were 13,062 defendants charged in fiscal year 2005, the record since 2000. The Justice Department’s figure of 15,300 for 2018 represents a 17 percent increase compared to 2005.  Another source of data that is commonly cited is from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) at Syracuse University, which compiles data through records requests from the federal government. One way Syracuse crunches the numbers is by isolating on the primary charge, versus a secondary charge. Looking at it that way, researchers at Syracuse show that prosecutions were slightly higher in 2003-05 than in 2018. The analysis also shows that federal firearm prosecutions started to rise in 2014 when Barack Obama was in office. They have continued to climb during Trump’s tenure. Trump cited prosecutions, but it’s important to distinguish between charges and convictions.  Although most federal cases end in guilty pleas, not all of the defendants charged with federal firearm offenses end up convicted of firearm offenses because some ultimately plead guilty to another type of charge. That means if we look at the number of defendants found guilty of a firearm offense, it would be lower than the number of those initially charged with a firearm offense. Attorney General Jeff Sessions wrote a memo in March 2017 to federal prosecutors calling on them to step up prosecutions of firearm charges. A few months later, the Justice Department attributed an increase in federal prosecutions to Sessions’ memo. A couple of other things to note: First, the vast majority of gun crimes are handled by state courts, not federal courts, said Jeffrey A. Butts, director of the Research & Evaluation Center at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. So Trump is talking about a small piece of the issue. ""Over the last 20 years, gun cases in federal courts fluctuated between 7,000 and 12,000 annually,"" Butts told PolitiFact. ""Meanwhile, in 2017 about 175,000 people nationwide were arrested for gun charges (possession, use in a criminal act, etc.)."" Second, part of the increase in federal gun crimes is likely due to the federalization of some crime types, Butts said. That means an increase may be related to a shift in the workload of state and federal courts more than some type of crackdown on gun crimes. Third, the federal statistics alone don’t tell us about the seriousness of each type of case.  The New York Times reported in May 2018 that federal prosecutors have increasingly targeted low-level gun offenders, raising questions about whether the tactic is the best use of resources. ""It’s a good idea to enforce the existing gun laws,"" Avery Gardiner, co-president of The Brady Campaign, which works to combat gun violence, told the New York Times. ""That’s something prosecutors should do. But going only after the people who are purchasing the guns illegally is only part of the story."" Trump said, ""Last year, we prosecuted a record number of firearms offenses."" Trump appeared to be referring to the number of defendants charged with federal firearm offenses in 2018, which the Justice Department announced was more than 15,300. The government said that was 17 percent more than the previous record. It’s important to note, however, that the vast majority of gun crimes are handled at the state level, and that the data doesn’t speak to the seriousness of the charge.  Trump’s statement is accurate but needs additional information",Mostly True,"August 5, 2019"
"Says of El Paso that some years, ""in a city of almost 700,000, we had five murders the entire year. Our average over the last 10 years is 18 (murders per year). We exceeded that average just on one day"" after a gunman opened fire at a Walmart in the city.","Former U.S. Rep. Beto O’Rourke spoke with reporters outside of the University Medical Center in El Paso on Saturday, after visiting with people who were injured in a mass shooting at a Walmart in the city. Twenty-two people were killed and more than two dozen were injured after a gunman opened fire at the store earlier that day. Twenty people were reported dead on the day of the shooting and two people died later at the hospital, according to the El Paso Police Department. O’Rourke, who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, told reporters that the people he met with at the hospital ""are asking us to do something about this.""  ""Yes, it’s the gun laws. Yes, it’s the universal background checks. Yes, we should stop selling weapons of war into our communities,"" said O’Rourke, who was born and raised in El Paso. ""But I think we also have to confront this hatred that I have never seen in my lifetime, and we certainly have not seen in El Paso. Some years, in a city of almost 700,000, we had five murders the entire year. Our average over the last 10 years is 18 (murders per year). We exceeded that average just on one day. This is not normal, it is not acceptable. We cannot just move on from this and the folks I just met with do not want us to move on from this.""  Are O’Rourke’s figures about his hometown accurate? Taking a look at the numbers O’Rourke spokesman Chris Evans said his figures came from a January news release from the city of El Paso that looked at the annual number of murders per year in El Paso over the past 59 years — from 1960 to 2018.  During that time period, the year with the most murders was 1993, when 56 murders were recorded in the city. The next closest year was 1980, when there were 54 murders. In 1964 and 2010, there were just five murders in the city. In 1965, there were nine murders, the only other year over this period when the total number of murders was in the single digits. Over the entire 59-year period included, the city averaged 23 murders per year. Over the past 10 years, from 2008 to 2018, El Paso averaged 18.1 murders per year. O’Rourke frequently touts crime figures from El Paso to say that the city is among the safest in the country.  The FBI cautions against using its uniform crime statistics to rank localities and researchers warn against ranking communities by relative safety.  Without ranking localities, FBI data shows that El Paso’s violent crime rate has been significantly lower than the average for all localities of a similar size (those with a population between 500,000 and 999,999 people) every year from 1985 until 2017, the latest available year from the FBI. Our ruling O’Rourke said some years in El Paso, ""in a city of almost 700,000, we had five murders the entire year. Our average over the last 10 years is 18 (murders per year). We exceeded that average just on one day"" after a gunman opened fire at a Walmart in the city. Let’s take this statement piece by piece.  El Paso’s population was approximately 682,669 in 2018, according to U.S. Census estimates. In 1964 and 2010, five murders were recorded over the year in the city. The average number of murders per year in the city was 18.1 over the past 10 years.  On Saturday, 20 people were killed and more than two dozen were injured after a gunman opened fire at a Walmart in El Paso.

"The El Paso and Dayton shootings were ""false flag"" attacks coordinated by the ""deep state.""","As of the morning of Aug. 5, weekend mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, had taken the lives of at least 30 people. But some social media users claim — without evidence — that the tragedies were planned and coordinated by leftists. Known as ""false flag"" conspiracies, the rumors started making the rounds on Facebook the morning of Aug. 4 following the Dayton shooting. Several Facebook posts claim that the shootings were staged by Democrats to push an anti-gun agenda ahead of the 2020 presidential election. ""TWO mass-shootings over the weekend. Both are a 'paid for' effort by the former deep-state leftist regime,"" one post claims. The posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) False flag conspiracies have become a recurring theme in the misinformation that follows mass shootings in the U.S.  After a gunman shot and killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., in February 2018, social media users and Russian bots shared the false claim that the tragedy was orchestrated by the so-called ""deep state,"" a purported faction within the government working against President Donald Trump. Similar hoaxes circulated after the mass shooting in Las Vegas in October 2017. While they’re about different shootings, the false flag conspiracies about the attacks in El Paso and Dayton are cut from the same conspiratorial cloth. One Facebook user published a photo of the Dayton suspect alongside the alleged gunman in a shooting at a garlic festival in Gilroy, Calif., last weekend, which left three dead. We found similar side-by-side comparisons on Reddit. ""DEEP STATE RECYCLES SHOOTERS,"" the user claimed in the post. (Screenshot from Facebook) The photo on the left comes from a story in The Daily Mail about Santino William Legan, 19, whom authorities have named as the gunman responsible for the Gilroy shooting. The photo on the right comes from a story by KTVT in Dallas about Patrick Crusius, 21, the suspect linked to the El Paso shooting. The shooting suspects may look similar, but that doesn’t mean they’re the same person. Authorities in both El Paso and Gilroy have identified two different suspects. Plus, Gilroy authorities said the gunman died at the scene of the shooting. Another post points to an article from Natural News, a known purveyor of health misinformation, that purports to show that ""the official news narrative about the El Paso Walmart mass shooting is largely fabricated."" PolitiFact hasn’t rated each of the five points the site brought up, but the article relies on conjecture and speculation to claim that the El Paso and Dayton shootings were false flag operations. Further, there’s no evidence to suggest that either attack was coordinated or otherwise planned by a left-leaning faction of the U.S. government. Authorities are investigating a manifesto published online by the alleged El Paso gunman shortly before the attack, which expressed hatred for Hispanic people and laid out an attack on them in the United States. Police still haven’t disclosed a potential motive for the Dayton shooter, who was killed on the scene, but media reports suggest that Connor Betts, 24, had talked about violent fantasies in the past.

"Says ""we lose nearly 40,000 people in this country to gun violence, a number that no other country comes even close to.""","Texan Beto O’Rourke joined nine other Democrats on stage in Detroit on Tuesday for the second round of debates in the Democratic presidential primary contest. All of the candidates made questionable statements — take a look at some fact-checking from the night — including O’Rourke, who was asked to respond to a comment about gun violence from Montana Gov. Steve Bullock.   Bullock said that Washington, D.C., ""is captured by dark money"" and political influence from the likes of the NRA and Koch Industries, making it hard for lawmakers to tackle issues like gun safety. ""That's the way we're actually going to make a change on this, Don, is by changing that system,"" Bullock said, addressing moderator Don Lemon of CNN. ""And most of the things that folks are talking about on this stage we're not going to address until we kick dark money and the post-Citizens United corporate spending out of these elections."" Lemon asked O’Rourke to respond to Bullock’s point. ""How else can we explain that we lose nearly 40,000 people in this country to gun violence, a number that no other country comes even close to, that we know what all the solutions are, and yet nothing has changed?"" O’Rourke said. ""It is because, in this country, money buys influence, access and, increasingly, outcomes."" We assumed O'Rourke was talking about the number of gun deaths in the United States in the past year, a figure supported by federal data. But is O’Rourke right that no other country comes close to the number of deaths by gun violence in the United States? We took a look. CDC data shows 40,000 deaths O’Rourke’s spokesman Chris Evans pointed to two studies of gun-related deaths around the world and a handful of media articles discussing the findings to support the Democrat’s claim. ""As we've visited communities across the country, we have consistently heard about the fact that gun violence is a major concern in the U.S. as no other developed country comes close to the number of gun deaths,"" Evans said.  In 2017, there were 39,773 firearm injury deaths in the United States (12.2 firearm deaths per 100,000 total population), according to information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention cited by Evans. Of those deaths, 60% were recorded as suicides and 36.6% were homicides, according to the CDC. The other 3.4% were marked as unintentional, undetermined or the result of ""legal intervention/war.""  But how do those figures compare to other countries?  Limiting by economic standing changes outcome Evans pointed to a 2016 study published in the American Journal of Medicine that measured violent death rates in the United States compared with other high-income countries, using mortality data from 2010. Researchers compared figures from the United States to the 26 other countries classified as ""high-income"" by the World Bank that were also members of the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development in 2010 — excluding Iceland and Luxembourg for ""having very small populations."" The study focused on violent death in general, but it also looked at firearm deaths and found that ""Americans are 10 times more likely to die as a result of a firearm compared with residents of these other high-income countries."" The same researchers conducted an updated study using data from 2015 and came to a similar conclusion and stated that, when it comes to firearm deaths, ""not one of the other high-income countries compares to the US."" Erin Grinshteyn, a professor at the University of San Francisco who co-authored both studies, said they compared the United States to other high-income countries to make an ""apples to apples"" comparison. ""Countries that are less developed are not similar to the US in many ways and would not typically be used as a comparison on other health indicators,"" she said. ""What O'Rourke said is accurate for high-income countries. We are a complete outlier compared to our peer countries."" But O’Rourke’s statement at the debate was not limited to other high-income countries. He said that ""no other country comes even close to"" the number of deaths from gun violence in the United States. The second study cited by Evans offers a broader look at global trends. The study, conducted by researchers at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, looked at firearm mortality around the world from 1990 to 2016. In 2016, the most current year in the study, there were an estimated 251,000 firearm injury deaths worldwide. The study found that more than half of those deaths were recorded in six countries: the United States, Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela and Guatemala.  Take a look at the number of firearm injury deaths in each of these countries in 2016, according to the study, in order of the total number of deaths:  The study revealed that in Brazil, most firearm deaths in 2016 were homicides. In the United States, slightly less than 40% of these deaths were homicides; the majority were suicides. ""Beto doesn't think the United States of America should take any solace in being second behind Brazil in that one study when it comes to the number of gun deaths each year,"" Evans said, when asked about the findings in the study. ""We should not be seeing more gun deaths in our country each year than significantly less developed countries."" He said the same study showed there were more gun deaths in the United States than in places like Columbia, Venezuela, Guatemala, Honduras, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen, Libya, and Syria. But the raw number of deaths is only part of the equation. There were 19 countries and U.S. territories with more firearm deaths per capita than the United States in 2016, or the same amount, according to an analysis of the study conducted by PBS Newshour. Evans pointed to news coverage of the study, including an article from NPR that said ""The level of gun violence in the United States is completely outsized compared to what's seen in other wealthy countries.""  But the same article noted that gun violence is a bigger issue elsewhere.  ""To be sure, there are quite a few countries where gun violence is a substantially larger problem than in the United States — particularly in Central America and the Caribbean,"" it reads.  A Vox article cited by Evans said that the United States ""has way more gun deaths than other developed nations, and it has far higher levels of gun ownership than any other country in the world."" But it also states that: ""While the rate of U.S. gun deaths is lower than that of many less developed countries, America is still an outlier when compared to nations in similar socioeconomic circumstances."" Evans also pointed to a write-up from the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence that stated: ""No other developed nation experiences mass shootings with the same terrifying frequency as the United States.""   The problem is that all of these findings are different than the statement O’Rourke made during the debate. O’Rourke did not limit his claim to high-income countries or those of ""similar socioeconomic circumstances."" Our ruling O’Rourke said ""we lose nearly 40,000 people in this country to gun violence, a number that no other country comes even close to."" Studies show that the United States experiences more firearm injury deaths than other countries of similar socioeconomic standing, but that’s not what O’Rourke said at the debate. Brazil experienced more firearm injury deaths in 2016 than the United States and more than a dozen countries had more firearm deaths per capita than the United States that same year",Mostly False,"August 2, 2019"
"""How many people have with a concealed carry permit have committed a crime in Virginia? ...The answer is zero.""","State Sen. Bill Stanley, R-Franklin County, recently offered an eye-popping statistic about Virgnians with concealed-carry permits for guns. ""How many people with a concealed-carry permit have committed a crime in Virginia? Do you know the answer to that?"" Stanley asked during a July 9 interview on The John Fredericks Show, a conservative radio broadcast.  ""The answer is zero,"" Stanley said. , Knowing that Virginia has issued hundreds of thousands of concealed-carry permits, we decided to fact-check Stanley’s claim.  Stanley, an ardent defender of gun rights, made the claim hours before the General Assembly held a special session July 9  to consider gun control measures proposed by Gov. Ralph Northam in response to a May 31 mass shooting at the Virginia Beach Civic Center that killed 12 and the gunman. Republicans adjourned the session in 90 minutes without considering any bills. Northam didn’t propose restricting concealed-carry laws. Stanley brought up the subject to make a point that legal gun owners are a law-abiding group and shouldn’t be saddled with new gun control measures. Concealed carry Virginia, with few exceptions, allows people 18 or older to openly carry firearms. But carrying a concealed weapon requires a circuit court permit. To get a permit, a gun owner must be at least 21 and ""demonstrate competence"" with a handgun by meeting criteria for firearm training. The applicant also must pass a background check. Permits are issued for five years. There were 642,396 Virginians with concealed-carry permits at the end of June, according to the Virginia State Police. The state police also keeps statistics on Virginia crime. But they don’t collect data on crimes by concealed-carry permit holders, according to Corinne Geller, public relations director for the state police. We also asked Philip Van Cleave, president of the pro-gun Virginia Citizens Defense League, if he knew of any statistics about crimes committed by concelealed-carry permit holders arrested in Virginia. His didn’t.  There is a way, however, to drill closer to Stanley’s claim of ""zero"" by looking at another data set kept by the state police: the number of concealed-carry permits revoked each year. State law lists a number of reasons for rescinding a concealed weapon permit. Some involve mental issues. Permits are also taken away from people dishonorably discharged from the military. But most of the reasons are for breaking laws. They include: The numbers During the 2019 fiscal year - ending June 30 - state police records show 464 concealed carry permits were revoked. In fiscal 2018, 583 were rescinded. Since fiscal 2010, 7,330 permits were taken away - an average of 733 a year.   The state police, as we’ve noted, don’t record reasons for the revocations. But for Stanley’s claim to be true, none of the reasons for these thousands of revocations would involve crime.  Stanley told us he misspoke on radio and meant to say that none of the gunmen in Virginia mass shootings - including Virginia and Virginia Tech in 2007 - had concealed carry permits. ""I didn’t mean that  permit holders haven’t committed petty or serious crimes, but I guess I did,"" he said. In Virginia and across the country, many gun supporters say that permit holders are far more law abiding than the general public. They point to Texas, which keeps the most comprehensive records among the 50 states that allow concealed-carry. Almost 1.4 million Texans had permits at the end of 2018, according to records from the state’s Department of Public Safety. That’s 4.7 percent of the population, or 1 of 22 people.  In comparison, 41,180 people were convicted of felonies in Texas last year, but only 163 of them had concealed-carry permits. That’s .004 percent of felony convictions, or 1 of every 250. Although statistics don’t exist to make a similar comparison in Virginia, it can be said that less than one-tenth of 1 percent of the state’s concealed carriers had their permits revoked last fiscal year, or fewer than 1 of every 1,000. Ruling Stanley said concealed-carry permit holders have committed ""zero"" crimes in Virginia.  The state police don’t keep such records. Van Cleave, one of the most knowledgeable defenders of guns in Virginia, says he’s unaware such statistics exist. Evidence from Texas, which keeps the most comprehensive data, shows its permit holders are far more law abiding than the general public. Even so, 163 Texas permit holders were convicted of felonies last year. We credit Stanley for acknowledging he misspoke, but we have to rate his original radio statement",False,"July 24, 2019"
"""Nearly every state that has legalized (marijuana) has also legislated that you lose your right to own a gun if you are prescribed, or buy it recreationally.""","People who support legalizing marijuana should proceed with caution, claims a recent Facebook post about communities that are decriminalizing the drug for medical and recreational use.  ""Nearly every state that has legalized it has also legislated that you lose your right to own a gun if you are prescribed it, or buy it recreationally,"" the May 14 post says. ""Pot legalization is turning out to be a back-door way for the government to get you to voluntarily give up your gun rights."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  A federal law that pre-dates legalization does prohibit users of controlled substances — including marijuana — from possessing firearms. But we found no evidence that states have legalized marijuana and then enacted their own laws to ban cannabis users from owning a gun. Dozens of states have legalized marijuana and we reached out to some of them to ask about the post. No one could corroborate the Facebook post’s claim.  Alex Traverso, a spokesman for the Bureau of Cannabis Control in California, told us he’s never even heard such a claim, nor seen anything about it in the state’s regulations.  Brian Smith, a spokesman for the Washington State Liquor and Cannabis Board, said there’s ""no link between purchasing recreational or medical marijuana and owning a gun.""  ""The product is not traced post-retail sale so there is no way of even linking the two,"" he said. Madeline Kane with the Oregon Liquor Control Commission said the agency doesn’t regulate firearms. But, she said, ""it is our understanding that what you have described may be related to federal policy."" Because marijuana is still illegal under federal law, said Tara Dunn, a spokeswoman for the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, it’s still classified as a controlled substance. People who apply for a firearm must complete a federal form that asks in part about unlawful marijuana use.  ""Warning,"" the form says under a question about the unlawful use of marijuana or other substances. ""The use or possession of marijuana remains unlawful under federal law regardless of whether it has been legalized or decriminalized for medicinal or recreational purposes in the state where you reside.""  That means that marijuana users may be rejected from purchasing a firearm, Dunn said.  Next, we turned to some marijuana experts to help us parse the federal and state laws. Matt Simon, the New England political director with Marijuana Policy Project, which advocates for marijuana policy reforms, including decriminalizing marijuana use, said the Facebook claim ""is absolutely false.""  ""I’m not aware of any state medical cannabis law or adult use legalization law that explicitly prohibits cannabis users from owning firearms,"" he said.  However, he said, under federal law it has long been considered illegal for a user of a controlled substance — including marijuana — to possess a firearm. Those are policies from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF), though, not state law.  In some cases, Simon said, local law enforcement has enforced the federal prohibition. While the Department of Health and Human Services in New Hampshire is forbidden by state law from sharing information from its therapeutic cannabis patient registry with federal agencies, Hawaii lets local police access its medical cannabis registry and gun owner registry.  Simon pointed to a 2017 Miami Herald story that reported the Honolulu Police Department sent letters to all medical cannabis patients who were also registered gun owners and told them they had 30 days to surrender their firearms. After pushback, Simon said, the police department said it wouldn’t enforce the policy.   Some states have moved to protect the gun rights of medical marijuana users. In Oklahoma, for example, the governor signed a bill on April 15 that says state and local agencies can’t deny gun rights to people because they use medical marijuana. Earlier this year U.S. Rep. Alex Mooney, a Republican from West Virginia, filed a bill that would amend federal law so that medicinal marijuana users wouldn’t be disqualified from purchasing a gun. (No action has been taken since it was introduced in the House on April 3.) Our ruling The Facebook post says that nearly every state that has legalized marijuana has also legislated that people who use cannabis lose their right to own a gun.  We didn’t find evidence to support this claim.  While federal law prohibits marijuana users from owning a firearm, states are not legalizing cannabis and then passing legislation that requires marijuana users to forfeit their gun rights",False,"July 9, 2019"
"Says ""Joe Biden calls for gun ban.""","As Democrats consider who to nominate as their presidential candidate, the National Rifle Association is sounding the alarm about former Vice President Joe Biden.  ""Biden calls for gun ban,"" reads the text over a photo of Biden.  ""If elected, Joe Biden promises he will BAN your guns,"" additional text says.  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The gun-rights organization commented on its post, telling users to ""read more"" and sharing a link to a Fox News story.  The story is about an education plan Biden released on May 28. The story notes that the plan says: ""As president, he will secure passage of gun legislation to make our students safer, and he knows he can do it because he’s defeated the National Rifle Association twice before. He’ll begin by again championing to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines — bans he authored in 1994. In the months ahead, he will release additional proposals to address the gun violence epidemic in our country.""  The 1994 law focused on 18 specific firearms and banned certain models of AR-15s and AK-47s. It was illegal to make such weapons for use by private citizens during the 10 years the ban was in effect. But, as this Washington Post primer on the ban notes, it was legal to own or resell any assault weapon manufactured before the law went into effect, meaning if you owned a banned gun before the ban, you could keep it or sell it.  When we asked the NRA about the post, Amy Hunter, a spokesperson for the organization’s Institute for Legislative Action, said: ""When we say Joe Biden promises to ban guns, we mean exactly what we say: He plans to ban guns. We did not say ‘all guns,’ and we didn’t characterize it as a ‘total gun ban.’""  If he wants to ban ""so-called assault weapons,"" she said, he is calling for a gun ban on ""millions and millions of guns,"" including the popular AR-15. But saying Biden calls for a gun ban could lead readers to believe he’s seeking to outlaw all firearms. Consider that in the United Kingdom, for example, four dog breeds are banned — it’s against the law to own pit bull terriers among other dogs. But to say that England has banned dogs is misleading; someone could understandably believe no dogs are allowed there.  Andrew Bates, a spokesman for Biden’s campaign, said the education plan is the only policy plan the campaign has released about guns.  Biden talked about a ""smart gun"" policy when he was asked about gun violence during the Democratic debate June 27. ""We should have smart guns,"" he said. ""No gun should be able to be sold unless your biometric measure could pull that trigger. It’s within our right to do that. We can do that. Our enemy is the gun manufacturers, not the NRA. The gun manufacturers."" Biden has been advocating for regulations that would require manufacturers to include a biometric system that would prohibit people from firing weapons unless their fingerprints are registered to that specific weapon, The Verge reported on June 27. On June 29, Axios published a story summing up where the 2020 Democrats stand on gun control. Biden, it says, believes only ""smart guns"" — ones that require a ""biometric measure"" to pull the trigger — should be sold. He has also supported the government buying back guns from owners. Hunter, of the NRA, said Biden has a long history of votes and statements that make his views clear.  Hunter cited seven votes by Biden on gun issues since 1990, including amendments to ban certain rifles, guns considered assault weapons, and semi-automatic weapons. Our ruling The NRA said Biden called for a ""gun ban."" Biden has advocated banning assault weapons, and he has a history of trying to ban certain guns. But as he vies for the Democratic presidential nomination, he isn’t promising to prohibit Americans from owning any gun. He said he’d again champion a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines like the bans he supported in 1994. Those bans prevented the manufacture and sale of certain weapons for private citizens to use; they did not confiscate or prevent the sale of weapons that were purchased before the restrictions went into effect.

"Red-flag laws have been ""shown to reduce the number of suicides by firearms.""","State Sen. Creigh Deeds, a leading voice for mental health reforms, is talking up a ""red- flag law"" in Virginia that would allow seizure of guns from people deemed substantial threats to themselves or others. The legislation is expected to be among several gun control bills put before the General Assembly in July special starting July 9. Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat, ordered the legislature to convene in the wake of a May 31 mass shooting at the Virginia Beach Civic Center that killed 12, in addition to the shooter. Deeds, D-Bath, discussed the upcoming session during a June 10 interview on the conservative Virginia Talk Radio Network ""The so-called red-flag bill; it’s been endorsed by a commission put together by President Trump at the federal level, it’s been enacted into law in a number of states, and shown to reduce the number of suicides by firearms,"" he said. Deeds is right that a Trump commission, and the president, have endorsed red-flag laws - also called ""Extreme Risk Protection Orders."" Fifteen states have adopted the laws, and many others are considering them. What caught our ear was his claim that the laws have been ""shown to reduce the number of suicides by firearms."" We wondered if he’s right. Deeds told us he doesn’t remember the source behind his statement. ""Maybe I just heard it; I don’t know,"" he said. Background Fifteen states and the District of Columbia red-flag law, also called extreme risk laws. They allow police - and often, family members - to petition a court to order the temporary removal of firearms from a person who may be dangerous to himself or others. After a set amount of time, the weapon is either returned to the person or the court order is extended. Supporters say the laws can prevent violent crimes and suicides. Opponents say the laws allow government seizure of firearms in violation of the Second Amendment. The National Rifle Association opposed the laws for many years, but in 2018 changed position and said it would back bills if they provide due process and require mental treatment for the person temporarily forfeiting his gun. In Virginia, a red-flag bill was defeated in January by a 4-2 vote of a Republican-controlled House subcommittee that routinely defeats gun control measures. The bill would have allowed a law enforcement officer to ask a judge deem a person poses ""substantial risk of injury to himself or others,"" and order seizure of his firearms for 14 days. The judge would have had options to extend the order for 180-day periods. There hasn’t been a lot of study on the effectiveness of red-flag laws, mainly because they’re a recent trend. ""Generally, it’s too early to tell whether red-flag laws work,"" the Nebraska Legislature was told by its research office in a February 2019 report. ""The majority of red-flag laws were enacted in 2018; only two states had laws in place prior to 2014, allowing little time for extensive study."" The Nebraska Legislature decided to delay consideration of a red-flag bill until next year. Studies The two senior red-flag states are Connecticut and Indiana, which enacted laws in 1999 and 2005, respectively. The vast majority of seizures in both states have been to prevent possible suicides - 68 percent in Indiana and some years, as high as 80 percent in Connecticut. Aaron Kivisto, a psychology professor at the University of Indianapolis, published a widely-cited study in 2018 finding red-flag laws were statistically likely to have reduced gun suicides in the two states. Indiana likely saw a 7.5 fewer gun suicides from 2005-2015 than it would have without the law. Kivisto wrote that statistical analysis ""suggests"" the law may have prevented 383 firearm suicides over the 10 years and 44 non-firearm suicides might be attributed to the law. Connecticut laxly enforced its red-flag law during its first eight years and the measure likely resulted in 1.6 percent fewer gun suicides from 1999-2007, according to Kivisto. Connecticut has seen stronger results since amping its enforcement in reaction to the 2007 mass shootings at Virginia Tech that killed 32 students and faculty in addition to the gunman, who had been adjudicated mentally ill but was still bought guns. From 2007- 2015, the Connecticut likely saw 13.7 percent fewer gun suicides than it would have without the law. But the results are not a clear overall win in Connecticut, While there were fewer gun suicides than might be expected, people may have turned to other ways to kill themselves. Kivisto estimated that law prevented 128 firearms suicides and might be ""attributed"" to 140 non-gun suicides. A complication with the statistics is that the raw number of suicides - with and without guns - has increased in Connecticut, Indiana, and across the United States this century. So have suicide rates per 100,000 people. Kivisto says his analysis suggests there would even have been even more gun suicides without the red-flag law in Connecticut and Indiana. Combining his results from Connecticut and Indiana, Kivisto concluded, ""These findings suggest that firearm seizure legislation is associated with meaningful reductions in population-level forearms suicide rates, with mixed evidence for a replacement effect."" Other studies of Connecticut and Indiana have been led by Jeffrey Swanson, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Duke University.  He statistically concluded in both states, about one life was saved for every ten guns seized. Our ruling Deeds said red-flag laws have been ""shown to reduce the number of suicides by firearms."" The scant research available, confined to two states, backs Deeds. Duke studies have concluded that one life was saved for every 10 firearms seized in Connecticut and Indiana. A University of Indianapolis study found it statistically likely that the two states would have experienced more gun suicides if they didn’t have the law. But Deeds’ claim could use some clarification. The number and rate of suicides - by gun or other means - have increased in both states and across the nation this century. What the studies conclude is that it would have been even worse in Connecticut and Indiana without the law. Another issue: While Connecticut had fewer gun suicides because of the law, the University of Indianapolis suggests the law caused a more than corresponding increase in suicides by other methods",Mostly True,"June 19, 2019"
"""Every day on average 500 people die from gun violence.""","U.S. Rep. Lucy McBath of Georgia, who became a gun-control advocate after her 17-year-old son was shot to death, tweeted on June 5 that she was praying the U.S. Senate would adopt the House-passed Bipartisan Background Checks Act. That drew a retweet from a Democratic colleague, Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, who added this statement: ""Supporting my colleagues’ call on Senate Majority Leader to vote on H.R. 8, 1112 & 1158. Gun violence is an epidemic. Every day on average 500 people die from gun violence. How many more lives will we let gun violence claim?"" At 500 per day, that would be 182,500 deaths per year from gun violence in the United States. The actual figure is nowhere near that high. The legislation (H.R. 8) would establish new background check requirements for firearm transfers between private parties. Transfers would be prohibited unless a licensed gun dealer, manufacturer, or importer first takes possession of the firearm to conduct a background check. There would be some exceptions, such as a gift between spouses. Currently, only federally licensed gun dealers, importers and manufacturers are required to conduct a background check for someone seeking to obtain a gun. The House, which is controlled by Democrats, passed the bill 240-190 in February 2019. National Public Radio reported then that passage in the Republican-majority Senate is unlikely. The White House has signaled that President Donald Trump would veto the legislation, which is opposed by the NRA. And Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has declined to take up the bill. When we last examined the numbers, earlier this year, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported there had been 39,773 deaths related to firearms in 2017. 2017 is still the most recent year for which annual statistics from the CDC are available. The figure counts deaths resulting from suicides (60 percent of the total), homicides, unintentional and undetermined deaths, as well as those from law enforcement. And it was the highest tally in at least 40 years. Meanwhile, the average over five years — 2013 through 2017  — is slightly lower, according to Brady, the nonprofit formerly known as the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. Either way, the total gun deaths per day is far fewer than the 500 Omar claims: Total gun-related deaths, 2017: 39,773. Average per day: 109. Average annual gun-related deaths, 2013-2017: 36,383. Average per day: 100. Two other anti-gun violence groups  — Everytown for Gun Safety, which McBath became a spokeswoman for after her son’s death; and Giffords, which is named for former U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords of Arizona — also use figures of 100 deaths per day or fewer. To get near the figure that Omar used, you have to count nonfatal injuries as well as deaths. For 2017, the daily average comes to 475 cases of gun-related deaths and injuries, based on CDC figures. But the CDC itself says its injury estimate is ""unstable because of small sample size."" And an analysis by The Trace and FiveThirtyEight indicates the CDC could be overcounting the number of firearm injuries. Finally, Amnesty International states that every day more than 500 people die from gun violence  — around the world. That’s the figure Omar’s office cited to back up her statement, and it arguably is low. A study published in 2018 in the Journal of the American Medical Association said there are about 250,000 gun deaths worldwide per year. That would amount to 685 per day. But Omar’s claim was clearly made in the context of legislation that would affect gun transactions only in the United States. Omar’s spokesman, Jeremy Slevin, defended Omar’s use of the 500 figure. But he acknowledged to us that Omar’s tweet was in the context of domestic legislation and that the reference to 500 could have been more precise. Omar said, ""Every day on average 500 people die from gun violence."" Her claim was made in promoting legislation that would add new background check requirements for gun transfers made in the United States. Based on the latest federal figures, for 2017, the average per day was 109  — that’s counting deaths resulting from suicides, homicides, unintentional and undetermined deaths as well as those from law enforcement. And it’s 100 if you use a five-year average for 2013 to 2017",False,"June 12, 2019"
"The media was silent that ""the Colorado school shooter is a transsexual, Trump-hating, Christian-hating, leftist freak.""","On May 7, a student was killed and more were injured in a mass shooting at STEM School Highlands Ranch in Colorado. Facebook posts reacting to the incident followed. One, from May 9, says: ""The Colorado school shooter is a transsexual, Trump-hating, Christian-hating, leftist freak .. and the media is silent."" The post also features a photo of a person in what looks like an orange jail uniform. It’s been shared more than 95,000 times, and it was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Here are the facts. There are two suspects in the shooting. One of the suspects is 16 years old and was listed on a court docket as Maya Elizabeth McKinney. But a lawyer for the suspect referred to McKinney as ""Alec McKinney,"" and the judge addressed the suspect as ""Mr. McKinney,"" Reuters reported on May 7. ""Denver’s ABC television affiliate, citing an unidentified police source, has reported that the younger suspect identified as transgender and had been bullied for it,"" the wire service said in its dispatch the day after the shooting. Some stories, such as this one from the Washington Post, don’t mention that McKinney is transgender. But others do, including these from Buzzfeed, The Wall Street Journal, and The Denver Post. However, the person in the photo that appears in the Facebook post is the other suspect, 18-year-old Devon Erickson, who has not been identified as transgender. And it was this suspect that the New York Post reported on May 8 shared social media posts critical of President Donald Trump and Christians while praising former president Barack Obama. ""You know what I hate? All these Christians who hate gays, yet in the bible, it says in Deuteronomy 17:12-13, if someone doesn’t do what their priest tells them to do, they are supposed to die,"" the New York Post says Erickson wrote on Facebook in May 2014. ""It has plenty of crazy stuff like that. But all they get out of it is ‘ewwwwww gays."" On May 9, the New York Post reported on online posts from McKinney, who, the paper said, is undergoing a female-to-male transition. McKinney tweeted about taking prescription drugs, disliking STEM students, and self-harm. The story doesn’t mention Trump or religion. The Facebook post appears to have conflated the two suspects in the shooting, drawing details about the gender identity of one of the suspects and references to Trump and Christians from the other’s social media posts. Media outlets have also reported that one of the suspects is transgender and that the other posted political missives online. How these insights into the suspects are related to the shooting is unclear. Citing this May 8 Daily Mail story, the New York Post reported that a friend of Erickson and McKinney wrote online that the two were troubled and didn’t get the help they needed. ""Devon did what he did because he’s a liberal or to make a statement,"" the friend said, according to the Daily Mail. ""He did it due to internal struggles. They’re both struggling with mental health issues and this is a time for awareness."" About McKinney, the friend said: ""Had people supported him in the way that he needed and deserved, he would not have struggled so much that he got pushed over the edge.""

"""Remember after the shooting in Las Vegas, (President Donald Trump) said, ‘Yeah, yeah, we’re going to ban the bump stocks.’ Did he ban the bump stocks? No.""","When Chris Wallace of Fox News asked Democratic presidential candidate Kirsten Gillibrand what can be done to stop shootings like the one in Virginia Beach, she wasted no time in laying blame on President Donald Trump. Gillibrand focused on bump stocks, the gun accessory that uses recoil to effectively turn a semi-automatic rifle into a fully automatic one — that is, from a weapon that requires a trigger pull to fire each round to one that shoots a steady stream of rounds with one trigger pull. Semi-automatic rifles are legal, but fully automatic weapons — sometimes called machine guns — are largely not. Bump stocks gained wide attention after they were cited as a major reason why a shooter in Las Vegas on Oct. 1, 2017, was able to kill 58 people and injure almost 900 attending a music festival. In the June 2 town hall, Gillibrand said, ""Stop being beholden to the (National Rifle Association), like President Trump is. … Remember after the shooting in Las Vegas, he said, ‘Yeah, yeah, we’re going to ban the bump stocks.’ Did he ban the bump stocks? No, because the NRA came crashing down and said, ‘Don’t you dare do any restrictions on our guns around this country.’"" A reader asked us to fact-check Gillibrand’s statement. We found that Gillibrand’s statement flagrantly disregarded the facts. Asked in the town hall about how to curb mass shootings, her answer was to attack — incorrectly — an instance in which Trump actually accomplished a goal that gun critics had sought, and where the administration directly disregarded the NRA, which had opposed an all-out ban. Bump stocks are now illegal in the United States, and it’s directly because of actions by the Trump administration. ""The senator is wrong,"" said Harold Corzine, a University of Central Florida sociologist who has studied gun policy. Once the role of bump stocks in the Las Vegas shooting became clear, Trump said he’d be open to banning the device. Just over two months after the Las Vegas shooting, the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives began the formal regulatory process of reviewing whether bump stocks should be banned. Trump publicly reiterated his support on Feb. 20, 2018, signing a memorandum ""directing"" the attorney general to propose regulations to ban all such devices. The final rule was published on Dec. 18, 2018, with acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker announcing that bump stocks ""fall within the definition of ‘machine gun’ under federal law, as such devices allow a shooter of a semiautomatic firearm to initiate a continuous firing cycle with a single pull of the trigger."" The NRA issued a statement after the final rule saying that it opposed an outright ban and had asked for an amnesty period in the rule. Neither request became part of the regulation. The Firearms Policy Coalition and individual pro-gun critics (but not the NRA) challenged the new rule in court, but the critics of the ban lost at the U.S. District Court level in February 2019. The following month, the Supreme Court declined to hear the case, allowing the ban to go into effect. The penalty for owning a bump stock is now up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine per violation. The ATF has a web page on how to destroy bump stocks in a way that satisfies the new rules, and one major seller of bump stocks, RW Arms, turned over its remaining inventory to the ATF to be shredded on March 26, 2019. A shooting instructor demonstrates the grip on an AR-15 rifle fitted with a ""bump stock"" at a gun club in North Carolina in 2017. (AP) Groups that favor stronger gun laws applauded the move, though some criticized how long it took and the fact that the ban was done through the regulatory process rather than by a law passed by Congress. Gillibrand’s national press secretary Evan Lukaske said the senator was referring to the NRA’s opposition to — and seeming ability to block — congressional legislation on bump stocks, and the 10-month lag between Trump’s expression of openness until the final rule was published. ""Sen. Gillibrand acknowledges that five months after the Las Vegas shooting, President Trump issued a ban that was enacted in December 2018, much to the NRA's chagrin,"" Lukaske said. ""Her statement supports the larger point, that the NRA uses money and influence to control members of the Republican Party, and prevent common sense gun reforms that the vast majority of Americans and gun owners support."" Such concerns, however, do not get at the point of her town hall remark. She left the strong impression that bump stocks are still legal, and that Trump went back on his word. Both assertions are flatly incorrect. Gillibrand said, ""Remember after the shooting in Las Vegas, (President Donald Trump) said, ‘Yeah, yeah, we’re going to ban the bump stocks.’ Did he ban the bump stocks? No."" Gillibrand’s effort to turn Trump into a villain on bump stocks flies in the face of the facts. In reality, bump stocks were a rare area in which Trump accomplished a goal sought by gun critics, and his administration’s rule was more forceful than what the NRA had sought. Thanks to the efforts of Trump and his administration, owning bump stocks is now a felony",False Pants on Fire,"June 6, 2019"
"""Anybody can buy any weapon, any time without much, if any, regulation. They buy it over the internet. They can buy machine guns.""","When Barack Obama was asked at a recent event in Brazil about the most difficult moment of his presidency, he talked about the slayings of 20 young children at the Sandy Hook Elementary School. ""I had to go comfort the parents,"" the former president said May 30. ""Some of you may be aware that our gun laws in the United States don’t make much sense. Anybody can buy any weapon, any time without much, if any, regulation. They buy it over the internet. They can buy machine guns."" Obama’s summary of American gun laws drew a quick rebuttal in the conservative press. Readers asked us to see how well his words match current law. We found some significant lapses. His characterization of regulation as ""without much, if any,"" is too loose to be fact-checked, but we can check out what he said specifically about U.S. gun laws. His comment on machine guns is especially off the mark. No, not anybody. Federal law bans many kinds of people from buying weapons. A list by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives includes: anyone convicted in any court and sentenced to a year or more in prison; anyone with a dishonorable military discharge; anyone convicted of domestic violence or subject to a court order against harassing or threatening an intimate partner; anyone addicted to a controlled drug or has been committed to a mental institution. An article in The Federalist, a conservative website, noted that people ""under 21 years of age may not purchase handguns from a gun dealer,"" and those under 18 can’t buy rifles or shotguns. There is a loophole with the age restriction, though. Informal sales within the same state create the opportunity for a young adult to buy a handgun. As the ATF guide notes, ""an individual between 18 and 21 years of age may acquire a handgun from an unlicensed individual who resides in the same state."" The bottom line is, people can buy firearms over the internet. Under federal law, it’s all the same, whether a person sells a weapon over the counter or over the web. The same rules apply. If the seller is in the firearms business, he or she must have a federal license and submit all sales for a federal background check. It is not legal to sell a gun to someone who is not allowed to buy one, but not every sale requires a background check that would alert the seller. If two people live in the same state and the seller isn’t in the firearms business (and federal rules define what that means,) then a gun can change hands without a background check. This issue lies at the heart of the push for universal background checks. As the Government Accountability Office described it in a 2017 report, potential gun buyers can shop from the websites of ""major retailers, online retailers, online auctions and marketplaces, online classified listings, online forums and social media networks, and Dark Web websites."" Most of the internet transactions are perfectly legal, with both parties going through all of the standard regulatory steps. There have been illegal sales over the web. In 2010 for example, a former FBI agent was convicted of selling over 50 firearms online without a license. But except for clandestine ""dark web"" transactions — operations set up to evade the law  — the GAO found that even informal sellers followed federal rules. Sellers ""on gun forums and other classified ads were unwilling to sell a firearm to an individual who appeared to be prohibited from possessing a firearm,"" the GAO reported. This is highly inaccurate. A machine gun is a fully automatic weapon, meaning one simple motion to squeeze the trigger releases multiple rounds. (See our work on how so-called bump stocks can blur this distinction.) Under federal law, no one can own or sell a machine gun, with one exception: ones owned before May 19, 1986, which are grandfathered in. And as UCLA law professor Adam Winkler told us, any sale or transfer of an old machine gun requires a special background check and a special license. Winkler called Obama’s sweeping language on this, ""absurd."" ""Plenty of weapons are not for sale to just anybody, including the machine guns he refers to, plus hand grenades, shoulder-launched missiles, etc.,"" Winkler said. Illegal transactions can occur. The GAO reported that someone sold one of its investigators an ""Uzi that the seller said was modified so that it would fire automatically."" But Obama was talking about what the law allowed, not whether criminals are able to skirt the law. People sometimes mistake a machine gun, which is an automatic weapon, for a semi-automatic weapon like an AR-15. CNN’s Don Lemon, for instance, made that error while talking about Second Amendment issues in 2014.  Obama said that in the United States, ""anybody can buy any weapon, any time without much, if any, regulation. They buy it over the internet. They can buy machine guns."" The assertion that anybody can buy a weapon flies in the face of the many types of people, from felons to drug abusers to spouse abusers, who may not buy weapons. Internet sales are legal, as he said, and they take place under the same rules that govern other gun sales. As for machine guns, they are strictly illegal, with the exception under legal controls of models from 1986 and earlier",Mostly False,"June 4, 2019"
"""We beat the NRA with tough, tough gun laws"" in Colorado.","The field of candidates seeking the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020 is about as crowded as advertising on a NASCAR racecar. Aiming to stand out, John Hickenlooper made claims on ABC’s ""This Week"" about getting things done during his time as Colorado’s chief executive. ""We've achieved almost universal health care coverage, and we beat the NRA with tough, tough gun laws,"" the former governor said. We’ve already rated as Mostly True Hickenlooper’s claim about universal health coverage. Now let’s see about beating the National Rifle Association. Hickenlooper’s campaign told us the candidate was alluding to two gun measures he signed into law in 2013, eight months after dozens of people were shot at a movie theater in Aurora, Colo. 1. Requiring universal background checks Federal law requires federally licensed gun dealers to obtain background checks on people they sell firearms to. One of the Colorado laws extends that requirement: Before anyone transfers possession of a firearm, including through private or online gun sales, he or she must arrange for a licensed dealer to obtain a background check. There are some exceptions, such as gifts between immediate family members. The law is tough in that Colorado is among only 11 states that require universal background checks, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. 2. Limiting magazine sizes Another law prohibits the sale, transfer or possession of magazines with more than 15 rounds of ammunition. Currently, Colorado is one of only nine states that ban large-capacity ammunition magazines, according to the Giffords center. The Denver Post reported in 2013 that California, New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts still had tougher gun laws than Colorado. But the new laws made Colorado stricter than other states in the Mountain West. So, did Hickenlooper and the Colorado Legislature, then controlled by fellow Democrats, defeat the NRA in getting those laws passed? We found that most news coverage described the legislation as a loss for the NRA. The New Yorker headlined a 2018 article, ""How Colorado Gun-Control Advocates Beat the NRA."" There’s more evidence of the opposition: The NRA established a website aimed at mobilizing opposition to the bills and took out print advertisements in Colorado newspapers attacking Hickenlooper, the Huffington Post reported at the time. A month before Hickenlooper signed the bills, an NRA spokeswoman told the Denver Post that the NRA opposed the bills because they would ""severely restrict your rights to keep and bear arms in Colorado."" The day before the signing, the NRA issued a statement saying that although Hickenlooper ""seems intent on signing this deeply flawed legislation into law, please contact him NOW and strongly urge him to veto"" the bills. In a statement on the signing of the legislation, the NRA said: ""The fight in Colorado to protect and now restore your individual rights is anything but over.  In the coming days, weeks and months, the NRA will be using every available resource at its disposal to rectify this situation."" For this fact-check, the NRA did not deny to us its opposition to the measures or say that the Colorado legislation is not ""tough."" It’s worth noting, however, that it’s not entirely clear how important the NRA’s opposition was. In news reports about Hickenlooper signing the bills, the Denver Post, the Colorado Gazette, the Associated Press and the New York Times did not cite opposition from the NRA. At the same time, the NRA wasn’t exactly toothless. It touted the fact that two other bills considered at the time did not become law. One bill would have repealed Colorado’s law allowing individuals with a concealed carry permit to carry a firearm on a college campus. The other bill would have held manufacturers, distributors and owners of guns they produce, sell or use, liable if that gun is misused to harm another person. In both cases, the sponsors of the bills pulled them from consideration amid opposition, according to news reports. Moreover, two Democratic lawmakers who provided crucial support to the legislation were recalled from office in special elections six months after the measures were signed, with the NRA spending nearly $362,000 in the effort. Hickenlooper, however, won re-election to a second term in 2014. The NRA continues to oppose expanding background checks, saying in part that the checks ""don’t stop criminals from getting firearms",Half True,"May 30, 2019"

An inquiry by South inspired  some Caesar Rodney alumni to explain the background of the photograph in a Facebook group post: ""... spring ‘73’ we had a series of bomb scares at the time and Kendall and Carl brought their hunting rifles to the door for a photo op. I believe it was exam week and seemed like everyone knew when the bomb scares were coming in, totally upset the exam schedule…"" ""One other funny thing about it was that it was the week of the Dover football game. We got bomb scares called in 2/3/4 times a day and by Wednesday or Thursday they decided to post 2 letterman at each door. Someone had a couple of shotguns out in the truck and (thought) it'd make for a funny (photo) op. This was it. Btw, guns were empty."" It is accurate that the school experienced a spate of false bomb threats that academic year, but according to local news reports, it appears to have occurred in the fall semester. According to a November 9, 1972 article in the Wilmington News Journal, the school received a series of bomb threats over multiple days, each resulting in the evacuation of the school’s 1,600 students. The article said the Board of Education was offering a ""$100 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the persons or person who have called in more than 10 bomb threats to the high school."" About a week later, the newspaper reported that police arrested three juveniles, all students from the school, and charged them with making false bomb threats. As well, many of Caesar Rodney’s yearbook photos were uploaded online, and the photograph of the two young men can be found in the 1973 collection. A viral image post online claims it depicts a student and teacher guarding a high school in 1973 after a shooting threat was made that day, and that because they and others were armed, ""no shooter ever arrived."" The image features two students (not a teacher) with guns outside of a Delaware high school in 1973, but there was no shooting threat. A series of bomb threats were reportedly made against the school that academic year, and alumni of the school say the picture of the young men was taken for a yearbook photo op.

"In Florida, ""it’s illegal for mayors to even bring up gun reform for discussion.""","Democratic presidential candidate Wayne Messam said he’d make the prevention of mass shootings his No. 1 priority if elected to lead the nation. Messam, a city mayor in the same county where the 2018 Parkland school shooting happened, claimed that his abilities are restrained now, because a Florida law prohibits him from even talking about changing gun laws. ""Last year, I sued the state to allow local leaders to protect our residents from gun violence because in Florida, it’s illegal for mayors to even bring up gun reform for discussion,"" Messam, the mayor of Miramar, Fla., said on his campaign website. Is it true that Florida mayors are legally barred from discussing gun laws? Messam’s claim needs context. The state Legislature in 1987 passed a law to give the state the exclusive right to regulate firearms and ammunition. And in 2011 the state added penalties that can be imposed on municipalities and local officials who violate the law by ""enacting or causing to be enforced any local ordinance or administrative rule or regulation"" on firearms and ammunition. The law doesn’t explicitly say they can’t talk about it. The penalties were added to prevent local officials from making and enforcing their own rules. Miramar and several other Florida cities have filed a lawsuit against the state. That lawsuit isn’t seeking to nullify the 1987 law that originally banned local officials from enacting gun laws, rather to get rid of the penalties added in 2011. What are the penalties? If a court finds the violation ""knowing and willful,"" the local official gets a civil fine of up to $5,000. The governor can also remove the person from office. ""The law appears to aim at stopping mayors from regulating via executive order,"" said James B. Jacobs, a law professor and director of the Center for Research in Crime and Justice at NYU School of Law. ""But it surely doesn’t prohibit advocacy or discussion."" In recent years, including after the Parkland shooting, some mayors have publicly called for stricter gun control measures.  Messam’s lawsuit against the state acknowledges that penalties in the law are for voting on and enacting ordinances. But the penalties violate the right to free speech and have the effect of silencing officials, the lawsuit argues. Elected officials don’t even debate ordinances out of fear of being penalized, the lawsuit said, adding that the penalties ""impose substantial burdens"" on constituents and elected officials’ ability to ""engage in core political speech leading up to a vote."" Messam’s spokeswoman, Cassandra Fenelon, said the law opens ""many questions as it pertains to municipal authorities and exceptions."" As a result of ambiguities in the law and the accompanying penalties, Fenelon said, local municipal attorneys advise officials not to discuss or enact policies on firearms and ammunition. The Legislature intends ""to chill and deter local governments from taking any action at all that might affect firearms, even when such action might not be preempted,"" Fenelon said. Messam said that in Florida, ""it’s illegal for mayors to even bring up gun reform for discussion."" Florida law prohibits local officials from enacting rules on firearms and ammunition. There are penalties for officials who enact or cause the enforcement of such regulations. Officials may choose not to discuss changes to gun laws, since they can’t legally enact them. But that law doesn’t directly prohibit the discussion of gun laws.

"""When Connecticut did licensing, their shootings dropped, their murders dropped 40%. Suicides dropped 15%.""","If he wins the presidency, Democratic Sen. Cory Booker says he will fight to deliver tougher gun control laws. In an interview on ABC This Week, the senator from New Jersey pointed to what he said was the success of a gun licensing law in Connecticut. ""When Connecticut did licensing, their shootings dropped, their murders dropped 40%. Suicides dropped 15%,"" he said. ""These are things that have been tried and done and that work."" We found that he correctly cited two studies, but experts said more research is needed to draw definitive conclusions. Booker was referring to two different studies about the effects of a 1995 Connecticut law requiring handgun purchasers to get a license. The law was passed after a series of gang shootings in 1993 and 1994 claimed dozens of lives. One study published in the American Journal of Public Health in 2015 examined the impact of the Connecticut law on subsequent homicides. (Researchers were from Johns Hopkins as well as University of California at Berkeley and San Francisco.) Under the law, a prospective handgun buyer had to clear an application process that included a background check to obtain a license. The buyer also had to apply for a permit with local police. The law also raised the legal age to buy a handgun from age 18 to 21, and it required applicants to undergo at least eight hours of gun safety training. Researchers found the ""permit to purchase"" law was associated with a 40% reduction in gun homicides between 1996 and 2005. The reduction amounted to 296 lives. They determined this by comparing Connecticut’s homicide rates after the law went into effect to rates that would have been expected if the law had never passed. Researchers used comparison data from other 39 states that did not have a similar law. Researchers also discovered the large drop in homicides was found only in gun-related killings, not homicides caused by other means, which suggests the law was the driving force behind the reduction. The other paper, which appeared in Preventative Medicine, examined the effects of two opposing state measures on suicide rates. In addition to the Connecticut law, Johns Hopkins researchers looked at a 2007 repeal of a 1921 Missouri law that had required anyone who wanted to buy a handgun to obtain a permit from the sheriff’s office. Using similar methods as the homicide study, the researchers calculated the cumulative percent change in firearm suicides during the post-law change periods for Connecticut (1996–2005) and Missouri (2008–2012). They found a 15.4% reduction in firearm suicide rates associated with Connecticut's law. Missouri's repeal of its law was associated with a 16.1% increase in firearm suicide rates. Daniel Webster, an author of both studies and gun researcher at Johns Hopkins, said it is impossible to determine with certainty causal connections of the effects of the law.   However, researchers used the best available data and forecasted what would have happened to Connecticut’s homicide and suicide rates had the state never implemented such a law, he said. Webster said there is debate among researchers whether one should forecast counterfactuals — what would have happened without the law, in this case — for a longer period than 10 years. While generally more data are better in research studies, too many years of data can make it harder to determine the impact of a law in some cases. However, Webster said that he has extended his research to look at the impact of Connecticut’s gun law through 2017 and found that the trend of the impact of the law continued. Researchers plan to submit their findings to a journal. While other experts have cited the Johns Hopkins studies, the RAND Corporation in a 2018 review of studies found the effects of licensing and permitting on homicides and suicides inconclusive. (RAND examined thousands of studies about the effects of various types of firearm laws in various places.) RAND doesn’t consider studies about a single state to show a causal effect that can be generalized to the United States population.   ""These particular studies are well-conducted and useful, but are not scientifically definitive,"" Terry Schell, senior behavioral scientist at RAND, told PolitiFact. However, RAND’s ""inconclusive"" finding should not be treated as evidence that there is no true effect of the Connecticut policy or that Johns Hopkins findings were wrong, Schell said. RAND’s finding only concludes that more research — for example, in different states or using different methods — is needed. David Hemenway, director of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center, explained it to us this way: the Johns Hopkins studies are strong but they are not definitive proof of the impact of these laws. ""There is a strong belief that licensing is one of those crucial things if you want to get a handle on trying to reduce gun violence,"" he said. That’s different from other types of research that have been replicated multiple times, such as showing that seat belts help keep passengers safe. Booker said, ""When Connecticut did licensing, their shootings dropped, their murders dropped 40%. Suicides dropped 15%."" Booker is correctly citing research by Johns Hopkins University. Researchers found that Connecticut’s 1995 law was associated with a 40% reduction in gun homicides between 1996 and 2005. In a separate paper, researchers found a 15.4% reduction in firearm suicide rates associated with the law. However, more research is needed on the topic to draw further conclusions",Mostly True,"May 20, 2019"
"""Nowadays, there is more regulation over toy guns than real ones.""","Democratic presidential candidate Cory Booker wants more regulations on guns, an industry he said is even less regulated than their toy imitations. Booker, a U.S. senator from New Jersey, laid out his plan for tougher gun control on Medium on May 6. In his multi-pronged plan, Booker made a case for more oversight of gun manufacturers. ""Nowadays, there is more regulation over toy guns than real ones,"" he wrote. Booker repeated this talking point in a CNN interview, saying that firearms are currently exempt from oversight from the Consumer Product Safety Commission: ""We have different regulations for toy guns and no regulations for weapons on our streets that are killing so many people."" Are there more regulations on the actual weapons than on their toy replicas? We decided to look at the regulations for both. We found Booker’s statement misleading. He oversimplified regulations to manufacturing standards only, while regulations on guns, real ones or imitations, don’t stop at that stage. Toy guns and real guns are regulated very differently, said Timothy Lytton, law professor at Georgia State University. Booker was on point citing federal consumer safety standards for toy guns and a lack thereof for firearms, which were exempted from Consumer Product Safety Commission oversight under a 1972 law. Toy guns must abide by general mandatory safety standards set by the commission for all toys, including labeling, preventing choking hazards and toxic substance testing. On top of that, toy gun manufacturers also need to meet federal requirements, so as to prevent the toys from being mixed up with lethal lookalikes. Toy guns need to either display a predominant color chosen from an approved list, or a blaze orange plug or a blaze orange band around the muzzle. Non-powder guns, including air, pellet and BB guns, are separate from toy guns. They are subject to general rules by the commission, which hasn’t adopted specific mandatory design standards. Booker has a point that unlike most consumer products, these federal consumer product safety standards are lacking for real firearms. No federal law in place regulates the safety design standards for firearms, and the commission also cannot recall defective firearms. Manufacturers can follow voluntary standards set by the Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers’ Institute on a voluntary basis. Those standards are not incorporated into U.S. federal law. But all of this doesn’t mean that firearms are unregulated. Seven states and the District of Columbia have set their own rules about safety standards and design related to firearms, for example, drop testing to ensure a gun doesn’t misfire when it is dropped. When it comes to defects of products, both toy guns and real guns manufacturers are subject to tort liabilities, said Eugene Volokh, law professor at the University of California at Los Angeles. That means people can sue manufacturers if they are injured by defective products. But the debate about gun policy today is hardly about defective products, Volokh said. Instead, the issue is criminal misuse, suicide as well as accidental shootings. The laws aimed at preventing harm, regulating sales and the distribution of firearms are much more extensive than for toy guns. ""It’s just wrong to say that there is more regulation over toy guns than real ones,"" said Volokh. Booker’s comparison leaves out laws for the distribution and sales of firearms and failed to mention the various legislations at the federal, state and local level. Federal laws have imposed restrictions on firearms licensing and ownership including background checks, banning certain types of guns (mostly assault weapons), and barring certain people from purchasing guns. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is the primary agency to enforce federal firearm laws, including the Gun Control Act, the National Firearms Act, and the Arms Export Control Act. They generally cover rules about importation of firearms, provisions regarding people banned from acquiring guns, taxing duties, etc. State laws have more detailed regulations concerning a range of topics including concealed carrying of firearms, owners’ responsibilities, and dealer regulations. Such restrictions generally don’t apply to toy guns. Alan Kaufman, the senior vice president of technical affairs at The Toy Association, told PolitiFact in an email, ""We are not aware of any restrictions on sale, distribution, or ownership of toy guns which comply with 15CFR 272,"" referencing the federal product safety requirements. One other key difference about toy and real gun regulations: federal funding for research. The Centers for Disease Control was explicitly barred from funding research to promote gun control due to the Dickey amendment. Only until recently a spending bill approved research on the cause of gun violence after the Parkland, Fla., school shooting, but no such restriction on public funding for research exists for toy guns. ""We spend a lot more government money on research in toy safety than we do government money in gun safety,"" said Lytton. ""And that's probably a more useful comparison."" Booker said, ""Nowadays, there is more regulation over toy guns than real ones."" His claim only factors in consumer safety standards and discounted a volume of federal, state and local laws and rules regulating the sales and distribution of firearms, which are more restrictive than and outnumber those regulating toy guns",Mostly False,"May 10, 2019"
"In 2017, the first piece of legislation that Republicans passed ""made it easier for the mentally ill to purchase guns.""","If elected president in 2020, California Rep. Eric Swalwell promises to break the deadlock on gun control legislation. So far, he has teamed up with Parkland survivor Cameron Kasky and other anti-gun violence organizations. He also proposed a national ban and buyback of semi-automatic assault weapons. Like Washington Gov. Jay Inslee on climate change, Swalwell is distinguishing himself from his many opponents in the Democratic primary by focusing on one issue. After announcing his candidacy on ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,"" Swalwell held a campaign rally in his hometown of Dublin, Calif. During the speech, he said: ""In 2017, Republicans took control of the House, the Senate, and the presidency. Sorry to remind you. The very first piece of legislation that they passed — the act that would tell the world, ‘These are the values we espouse above all others’ — was a bill that made it easier for the mentally ill to purchase guns. They called it House Joint Resolution 40."" The fourth-term congressman accurately described the Republican-sponsored law, but it wasn’t the first to pass that year. H.J. Res. 40 undid a Social Security Administration rule requiring the agency to report certain disabled applicants to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. Federal law stipulates that anyone ""who has been adjudicated as a mental defective or has been committed to any mental institution"" cannot own a gun. In 2008, George W. Bush signed the NICS Improvement Amendment Act, which mandated federal agencies to report certain disabled individuals to the database. Federally licensed firearms dealers use the database to screen potential gun buyers. The SSA rule was issued in 2016 to comply with the NICS Improvement Amendment Act. The Obama administration said that it would affect ""the approximately 75,000 people each year who have a documented mental health issue, receive disability benefits, and are unable to manage those benefits because of their mental impairment, or who have been found by a state or federal court to be legally incompetent."" It also included a mechanism for people to seek an exemption from the ban on owning a gun for mental health reasons. But in 2017, Republicans — backed by the National Rifle Association and disability rights groups — initiated a rarely-used process to void the SSA rule. At the forefront of the effort was Iowa Sen. Charles Grassley, who argued that the federal regulation stigmatized people with disabilities and infringed on the constitutional right to bear arms. A blog post by the American Civil Liberties Union said, ""The thousands of Americans whose disability benefits are managed by someone else range from young people with depression and financial inexperience to older adults with Down syndrome needing help with a limited budget. But no data — none — show that these individuals have a propensity for violence in general or gun violence in particular."" Other organizations opposed the reversal. The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence released a statement that said if H.J. Res. 40 passed, ""people considered a danger to themselves or others will once again be allowed to get guns."" Some states have their own laws on reporting certain disabled people to the NICS or a similar state database, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. President Donald Trump signed H.J. Res. 40 into law on Feb. 28, 2017. But it wasn’t the first law passed by the Republican-controlled Congress that year. It wasn’t even the first joint resolution. The laws passed before that included measures to nullify environmental protections related to coal mining and promote women and girls in STEM careers. Swalwell said that after Republicans won the majority in both chambers of Congress, the first law they passed made it easier for the mentally ill to purchase guns. He was correct that H.J. Res. 40 eliminated barriers for certain disabled individuals to buy guns, but it wasn’t the first law passed in 2017",True,"April 22, 2019"
"""The states that have passed (campus carry laws) have seen enrollment drop significantly.""","During their most recent legislative session, West Virginia lawmakers took up a bill that would require colleges in the state to allow students to carry guns on campus as long as they possess a concealed carry permit. The bill ultimately passed the House, largely on party lines, before falling in the Senate. During the House debate, one Democratic delegate, Andrew Byrd, argued that passing the bill could keep students from enrolling in the first place. ""The states that have passed (a campus carry law) have seen enrollment drop significantly,"" Byrd said, according to an account in WVNews.com. ""We need to encourage people to come to our state, not be afraid to come to our state."" Has there been a significant enrollment drop in states that have passed a campus carry bill? We took a closer look. When we contacted Byrd, he pointed to an article in the Houston Chronicle about international student enrollment declining in Texas, a state that has enacted a campus carry law. ""International applications to Texas' four-year public universities have plummeted over the past year by at least 10,000, a 12.5 percent decrease from last fall, according to a Houston Chronicle review of university data,"" the article said. The article cited possible explanations by experts, including Jeff Fuller, a former admissions director at the University of Houston. The most prominent explanations were ""a sluggish global economy,"" ""greater competition from other countries,"" and ""President Donald Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric,"" which Fuller said ""has made some international students uncomfortable."" A less prominent explanation in the article was Texas’ campus carry law, with Fuller saying it was ""a sticking point for some applicants."" However, this is not especially strong evidence to support Byrd’s assertion. Byrd said ""states,"" but Texas is just one state. He also didn’t specify international student enrollment, which the article did. It’s also not clear that campus carry was the primary factor driving Texas’ decline. So we decided to take a broader look at states that enacted campus carry. Pedro Ribeiro, a spokesman for the Association of American Universities, said his group had no systematic data on the issue. So we dug through the numbers ourselves, state by state. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 16 states explicitly ban carrying a concealed weapon on a college campus, while in 23 others, the decision is left up to each college or university. For instance, Liberty University in Lynchburg, Va., allows campus carry despite the absence of a state law. Tennessee, meanwhile, allows the right for faculty members but not students or the public. Here, we’ll focus on the remaining 10 states that have either legislation or court rulings that allow the carrying of concealed weapons on public post-secondary campuses: Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Idaho, Kansas, Mississippi, Oregon, Texas, Utah and Wisconsin. (Private schools are not included in the data because they are not required to follow the same guidelines.) When we looked at the data state by state, we found that public university enrollment trends in campus carry states have been, at best, inconsistent. Some states actually saw an increase after the law came into effect. We did not assess Arkansas, because we could not find data for the relevant period. Four states -- Colorado, Kansas, Oregon, and Wisconsin -- did see decreases after passage, though they were fairly small. The campus carry law in Colorado took effect in 2010. Between that year and 2015, the most recent year available, enrollment fell by 5.8 percent. In Kansas, the campus carry law has only been in effect for a little over a year. Between 2017 and 2018, the enrollment decrease was 1.1 percent. Oregon initially saw a 2.9 percent increase in enrollment in 2011, the year its campus carry bill came into effect. Since then, enrollment has fallen by 4.6 percent. Wisconsin’s campus carry law also came into effect in 2011. Through 2015, the most recent year available, enrollment declined by 8.8 percent. Two states saw no clear pattern in their enrollment figures. Mississippi’s campus carry law took effect in 2010. For the first year, the number rose. Enrollment dropped for the next three years, then increased again in 2015, the most recent year with available data. Utah saw an increase after its campus carry law took effect in 2004. Since then, there was a three-year decrease, followed by a four-year increase, another decrease in 2012, an increase in 2013, and another decrease in 2014, the last year for which data is available. The remaining three states actually saw increases in their enrollment. Texas passed its campus carry law in 2016 but data shows a 2.9 increase in enrollment between 2015 and 2017. Georgia’s campus carry law took effect in 2017. Enrollment has increased by 2.2 percent since before the law. Finally, Idaho’s enrollment rose by about 11 percent after its campus carry law took effect in 2014. The most recent data for Idaho runs through 2015. To sum up: Four of the nine states we looked at saw fairly consistent enrollment declines after a campus carry law took effect, while two showed no consistent pattern and three saw enrollment increases. In other words, there was a lot of variability, contrary to what Byrd said. But even in the cases of the states with modest declines, it’s not clear that gun laws were the driving force. Many other factors -- such as the size of a state’s college-age population, whether universities are expanding or contracting their offerings, and broader economic forces -- can affect enrollment numbers. For instance, improving economic conditions after the Great Recession may have led some students to take jobs rather than enroll in college. David Bills, a University of Iowa sociologist who studies education, said it’s not impossible that there could be some relationship between campus carry and enrollment declines, but he said he’s never seen research on this question. ""Establishing a causal relationship between a particular law and enrollment trends would demand a very rigorous research design,"" Bills said. ""The standard of evidence would have to be pretty high. … If that research exists now, I'm not aware of it."" Byrd said, ""The states that have passed (campus carry laws) have seen enrollment drop significantly."" His evidence for this assertion was one newspaper article that speculated that campus carry was a reason why international enrollment has declined in Texas. But that’s a far narrower finding than he indicated -- and other factors have as good a claim, if not a better one, for being the driver of that decline. When we looked at the numbers more broadly, there is no consistent pattern in states’ enrollment fluctuations following the enactment of campus carry laws. In fact, a slight majority of states either saw increases or a zig-zagging trend line. And even in the states where enrollment dropped, it is hard to say that campus carry was the reason",False,"April 16, 2019"
Photos related to gun violence in present-day United States and the Holocaust in Nazi Germany suggest that gun control laws created or exacerbated the genocide of Jews.,"On March 13, 2018, gun control activists laid 7,000 pairs of shoes on the lawn outside the Capitol in D.C. to represent the victims of gun violence since the Sandy Hook shooting in 2012. Soon after, gun-supporting social media users created an image meme to compare it to Nazi Germany. The viral image shows the shoes on the Capitol lawn along with the words, ""shoes left by supporters of gun control, 2018."" Below that is a photo of a pile of thousands of shoes belonging to concentration camp victims, with a caption beside it that says ""shoes left by victims of gun control, Germany 1945."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The images are authentic and not altered – both are from the time and places that the captions designate (the concentration camp image is from a facility in Dachau, Germany) – but the message that gun control measures helped cause the deaths of Holocaust victims is wrong. Let's make something clear: The Nazis did deny guns specifically to Jews. But, given the size of their forces and their methods of confiscation and extermination, this is a trivial factor. The notion that it would have made any difference is unreasonable. PolitiFact previously looked into the theory when Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson linked the Holocaust with U.S. gun control laws when he was running for president in 2015. We rated that claim False. So how is it false? Let us explain. First, strict German gun regulation was in place before Hitler rose to power and he later oversaw gun laws that loosened many firearm restrictions. According to a 2004 analysis by Bernard Harcourt, a professor at Columbia University, after the Germany’s defeat in World War I, the Weimar Republic, the government that preceded Hitler’s, passed very stringent gun laws that essentially banned all gun ownership in an attempt to both stabilize the country and to comply with the Treaty of Versailles of 1919. By the time the Nazi Party came around in the early 1930s, a 1928 gun registration law had replaced the total ban and, instead, created a permit system to own and sell firearms and ammunition. But Dagmar Ellerbrock, an expert on German gun policies at the Dresden Technical University in Germany, told PolitiFact in 2015 that the order was followed ""quite rarely, so that largely, only newly bought weapons became registered. At that time, most men, and many women, still owned the weapons they acquired before or during the first World War."" The Nazis used the records to confiscate guns from their enemies, but Ellerbrock also said the files included very few of the firearms in circulation and that many Jewish people and others still managed to stash away weapons into the late 1930s. In 1938, the Nazis adopted the German Weapons Act, which ""deregulated the acquisition and transfer of rifles and shotguns as well as ammunition,"" Harcourt wrote. Under this law, gun restrictions applied only to handguns, permits were extended from one year to three years, and the legal age of purchase was lowered from 20 to 18. Moreover, many more categories of people, including holders of annual hunting permits, government workers and members of the NSDAP (the National Socialist German Workers' Party), were no longer subject to gun ownership restrictions. Regulations were introduced, though, to impose limits on Jews. On Nov. 11, 1938, the Regulations Against Jews' Possession of Weapons was issued. Under it, Jews living under the Third Reich were forbidden to own or possess any form of weapons, including truncheons, knives, firearms and ammunition. But the Nazis had already been raiding Jewish homes by then, and the Anti-Defamation League, an organization founded to fight anti-Semitism, explained in 2013 that ""the small number of personal firearms in the hands of the small number of Germany’s Jews (about 214,000) remaining in Germany in 1938 could in no way have stopped the totalitarian power of the Nazi German state."" Omer Bartov, a historian at Brown University who studies the Third Reich, told Salon in 2013 that even if they had weapons, Jews probably wouldn’t have had much success fighting back: ""Just imagine the Jews of Germany exercising the right to bear arms and fighting the SA, SS and the Wehrmacht. The (Russian) Red Army lost 7 million men fighting the Wehrmacht, despite its tanks and planes and artillery. The Jews with pistols and shotguns would have done better?"" Some supporters of the theory point to the 1943 Warsaw Ghetto Uprising as evidence that Jews with guns were successful in resisting Nazis. But, in that uprising, about 7,000 Jews died and 50,000 were sent off to concentration camps. Though the number of German losses from the uprising is in dispute -- ranging from estimates of less than 20 to a several hundred -- even the highest ranges come to just a fraction of the number of Jews who died. Second, experts and historians have widely criticized the argument, calling it problematic, dubious and preposterous.   In the same 2013 statement, the Anti-Defamation League said the comparison of U.S. gun laws to the Holocaust inappropriate and offensive. ""We know that the national debate over gun control is one of the most divisive issues in the land, and while Americans are entitled to have strong opinions, there is also language that is inappropriate and offensive in any such discussion,"" said Abraham H. Foxman, Holocaust survivor and ADL’S national director at the time. ""The idea that supporters of gun control are doing something akin to what Hitler’s Germany did to strip citizens of guns in the run-up to the Second World War is historically inaccurate and offensive, especially to Holocaust survivors and their families."" Harcourt also told PolitiFact the suggestion is not a tenable claim. ""There’s no empirical evidence for it,"" he wrote in an email. ""Moreover, Hitler was in favor of gun possession, and relaxed gun control laws in Germany for everyone, except Jews of course. It makes no sense to compare Hitler to the present situation in the US because all of Hitler's actions can only be interpreted through the lens of the final solution, which is not relevant here in the US."" On social media, images showing the shoes of victims of gun violence in present-day America and those of Holocaust victims suggest that gun control in Nazi Germany exacerbated the Holocaust and that the genocide could have been lessened or avoided if victims had been armed. This theory has been repeatedly debunked and refuted. German citizens as a whole were not disarmed by the Nazis, but enjoyed looser gun restrictions than in previous years. There was no lack of guns in the country, and if German citizens had wanted to use guns to revolt against the Nazis they could have, but they didn’t. As well, comparing a dictator’s regime that treated weapon possession according to racial identity to democratic procedures of gun regulations is irresponsible",False,"April 8, 2019"
"""In 2011, for example, the United Kingdom had 146 deaths due to gun violence; Denmark, 71; Portugal, 142; and Japan, 30. But last year, in the United States, almost 40,000.""","A week before the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School mass shooting anniversary, the House Judiciary Committee held its first hearing on gun violence in nearly a decade. Committee chairman U.S. Rep. Jerrold Nadler,  D-N.Y., opened the hearing with a sobering statement: ""Every day in America, on average, 34 people are murdered with a firearm, and more than 183 people are injured in an attack."" Nadler warned of the prevalence of U.S. gun violence compared with other industrialized countries. ""But while no other country in the industrialized world would tolerate such statistics — in fact, gun deaths in most of those countries barely crack triple digits annually — in the United States, it is accepted as a grim reality,"" Nadler said. ""By comparison, in 2011, for example, the United Kingdom had 146 deaths due to gun violence; Denmark, 71; Portugal, 142; and Japan, 30. But last year, in the United States, almost 40,000."" The House Judiciary Committee passed HR 8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act, by a 23-15 vote on Feb. 13, prepping it for a full House vote. It is not expected to pass the Republican-led Senate. Nadler’s comparison highlights the magnitude of gun deaths in the United States, and we were curious to find out if his statement is accurate. The claim in absolute numbers doesn't account for massive differences in population. Denmark, for example, has 5.7 million people, while the United States has 325.7 million. That said, when you factor in the rate of gun deaths, the United States remains an outlier.  Nadler’s estimate for U.S. gun deaths is basically right (although we don’t have numbers for 2018 yet). When he said ""last year,"" he was most likely pointing to the number of gun deaths in 2017, the most recent year for which data is available, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That year, 39,773 deaths were related to firearms. The number captures deaths resulting from suicides, homicides, unintentional and undetermined deaths as well as those from law enforcement. Nadler claimed there are an average of 34 deaths and 183 injuries resulting from firearm assaults per day, which echoes a five-year average calculated by the Brady Campaign to Protect Gun Violence, a nonprofit gun control advocacy group. The numbers creep higher when looking at 2017 alone, we found. An average of almost 40 people were murdered every day with a firearm in 2017. And 107,002 nonfatal gunshot injuries involved firearm assaults in 2017, according to the CDC, or about 293 injuries per day. According to the CDC database, the number of nonfatal injuries related to firearm assaults grew sharply from 62,896 in 2015, to 88,702 in 2016, before hiking to 107,002 in 2017. Deaths from homicides involving firearms also rose. Nadler compared the United States’ annual total in 2017 against other countries’ numbers in 2011. (Back in 2011, 32,351 in the United States lost their lives because of guns.) Nadler’s numbers are consistent with the number of deaths on Gunpolicy.org, a public health database hosted by the University of Sydney. Its numbers are gleaned from the World Health Organization's Mortality Database. More recent data is available for Denmark (82 in 2014), Japan (28 in 2014), Portugal (155 in 2014) and the U.K. (144 in 2013). Experts pointed out that Nadler highlighted a small sample, leaving out a couple of advanced countries with higher gun death counts. For example, France saw about 2,330 firearm-related deaths in 2016, while Germany had 1,220 firearm mortalities that year, according to the study Global Mortality From Firearms, 1990-2016 done by researchers at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. Also, it is important to consider differences in population size when drawing comparisons with other countries. ""Nevertheless, the point he’s making — that the United States has far more gun deaths than any other industrialized nation, and far more per capita than any other industrialized nation — is correct,"" said Philip Cook, a prominent gun researcher and Duke University emeritus professor of public policy. While there is no uniform definition of industrialized countries, a 2016 study published in the American Journal of Medicine compared the total firearm death rates per 100,000 people among high-income Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development member countries in 2010. Among most industrialized countries, the United States does have an outstanding rate of firearms mortality and almost triples the rate of the next country in line, Finland. Finland had a gun-related death rate of 3.6 per 100,000 people in 2010. The gap between the U.S. and other countries’ firearm-related death rate widened between 2010 and 2016. This does not make the United States the leading country for violent gun deaths in the world. Our previous reporting looked into violent gun death rates internationally (excluding suicides and others) in 2016 and found that the U.S. ranks No.10 worldwide, according to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. El Salvador (40.29), Venezuela (34.77) and Guatemala (28.81) had the highest firearm homicide rates per 100,000 people, as compared to 3.85 in the United States. Nadler said, ""In 2011, for example, the United Kingdom had 146 deaths due to gun violence; Denmark, 71; Portugal, 142; and Japan, 30. But last year, in the United States, almost 40,000."" The numbers Nadler mentioned were largely accurate for their corresponding years, but his claim was missing some context. Some of Nadler’s exact figures were dated, and they didn’t consider each country’s relative population. Still, the most recent figure shows that magnitude and rate of firearm-related deaths in the United States surpass most, if not all, of its industrialized counterparts",Mostly True,"February 14, 2019"
"""In 1992, the Democratic Party had in their platform provisions that said that illegal aliens were coming in this country, committing felonies, sent back and then they were right back across the border to do the same thing.""","In an emotional congressional hearing on gun violence, U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., sparked controversy when he brought up deaths by immigrants in the country illegally, drawing shouts from fathers whose children were shot to death in Parkland. Gaetz said Feb. 6 that a proposed gun background check bill would not have stopped violent crimes committed by undocumented immigrants. However, he said that a ""wall, a barrier on the southern border may have."" The next day, CNN host Chris Cuomo asked Gaetz why he brought up immigrant-linked deaths during the gun violence hearing in an interview the next night. Gaetz offered a fiery rebuttal, misleadingly saying that the ""new left"" wants to be ""borderless with no ICE."" ( In 2018, congressional Democratic leaders called for a restructuring of Immigration and Customs Enforcement — which handles removals from inside the country — but not an end to immigration enforcement. A few Democrats seem to want the agency shuttered, but many others talk of changing or limiting the agency.) At one point, Gaetz argued that the Democrats used to call for cracking down on illegal immigration, too. ""In 1992, the Democratic Party had in their platform provisions that said that illegal aliens were coming in this country, committing felonies, sent back and then they were right back across the border to do the same thing,"" said Gaetz, of Fort Walton Beach. Gaetz’s claim about the party’s platform was new to our ears, so we decided to fact-check it. We found that Gaetz had a point, but was off by one presidential cycle. The 1996 Democratic Party platform was unusually tough in raising alarm about illegal immigrants committing crimes, being deported and returning to the United States. The political parties write platforms in presidential election years to outline their positions on major political issues. They offer a collective vision to which the candidates are somewhat bound. ""Convention delegates, interest groups, party activists, and party officials fight very intensely over planks in the platform because they believe those words are important and define just what the party stands for,"" said University of Denver political science professor Seth Masket. ""They're not just to tell candidates what to run on; they're to tell party members just what kind of candidates they want to nominate in the first place. The 1992 party platform said very little about immigration. The brief mention shows the Democrats using welcoming terms: ""Our nation of immigrants has been invigorated repeatedly as new people, ideas and ways of life have become part of the American tapestry. Democrats support immigration policies that promote fairness, non-discrimination and family reunification, and that reflect our constitutional freedoms of speech, association and travel."" Gaetz’s spokeswoman told us that he was referring to the 1996 party platform, which indeed offered a sharp turn. That platform took a hard-line stance against illegal immigration and praised efforts on border security by President Bill Clinton, who was running for his second term. Part of the platform read: ""Today's Democratic Party also believes we must remain a nation of laws. We cannot tolerate illegal immigration and we must stop it. For years before Bill Clinton became president, Washington talked tough but failed to act. In 1992, our borders might as well not have existed. The border was under-patrolled, and what patrols there were, were under-equipped. Drugs flowed freely. Illegal immigration was rampant. Criminal immigrants, deported after committing crimes in America, returned the very next day to commit crimes again. … Just since January of 1995, we have arrested more than 1,700 criminal aliens and prosecuted them on federal felony charges because they returned to America after having been deported."" That language is similar to what Gaetz cited: the Democrats talked about immigrants in the country illegally committing crimes, being sent back to their home countries, and then returning to the United States. Gaetz didn’t mention this, but the platform also contained a pro-immigration message. It said, for example, ""we deplore those who blame immigrants for economic and social problems"" and ""deplore those who use the need to stop illegal immigration as a pretext for discrimination."" At the time, the Republican Party platform was more aggressive. It asserted that undocumented immigrants increase crime, that children of illegal immigrants should be blocked from gaining citizenship, and English should be the official U.S. language. It had a brief nod about the United States as a nation of immigrants: ""We welcome those who follow our laws and come to our land to seek a better life. New Americans strengthen our economy, enrich our culture, and defend the nation in war and in peace."" The Democratic platform in 1996 was influenced by the changing immigration politics of the early to mid 1990s. The number of unauthorized immigrants was rapidly rising, from 4.2 million in 1992 to 5.6 million in 1996 (a 33 percent increase). Public opinion polls indicated that two-thirds of Americans believed that immigration levels should be decreased. Major constituencies of the Democratic Party, including unions and environmentalists, also advocated for reductions in immigration, said Rey Koslowski, a University at Albany political science professor. The U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform chaired by Democrat Barbara Jordan recommended increasing Border Patrol officers, restricting the ability of undocumented immigrants to get public services and reducing legal immigration. The more conservative approach was part of Clinton’s broader effort to move the Democratic Party to the center. The ""New Democrat"" agenda included his 1996 overhaul of welfare (half of which was initially paid for by cutting all benefits to permanent resident aliens) as well as revisions to immigration law. The Democratic Party, having spent a long time being battered as being soft on crime, made a strategic decision to embrace the illegal immigration control pieces of the legislation, said William Stock, former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. Clinton signed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act into law on Sept. 30, 1996 — just in time for the November presidential election. The 1996 law called for deporting immigrants who were once legally in the United States but now subject to deportation because of a criminal conviction. These efforts in 1996 helped Clinton attract a large swath of voters, including industrial workers in the midwest (so-called Reagan Democrats), independents, environmentalists and Southern Democratic voters. ""And it worked,"" Koslowski said. Before the election, the Republicans thought they would parlay their 1994 midterm sweep into a presidential victory, choosing San Diego, Calif., as the site of their national convention. Two years before, California voters passed a measure that prohibited illegal immigrants from using health care, public education and other services. (Courts later deemed Proposition 187 unconstitutional.) Clinton won re-election and received 72 percent of the Latino vote. Over time, the Democratic Party’s platform shifted to helping undocumented immigrants as immigration became more of a civil rights issue. The 2016 platform made a passing nod to border security, calling for a pathway to citizenship and stating that enforcement should focus on safety threats. ""President Trump and his aggressive immigration enforcement, unlike that seen in any modern president, has further polarized the issue and led many Democrats to resist the enforcement initiatives,"" said Kevin Johnson, dean of the University of California Davis, School of Law. Gaetz said, ""In 1992 the Democratic Party had in their platform provisions that said that illegal aliens were coming in this country, committing felonies, sent back and then they were right back across the border to do the same thing."" He got the year wrong; he was was actually referring to the 1996 platform. That document touted Clinton’s efforts on stopping illegal immigration. Using similar words as what Gaetz described, it said that in 1992, ""Drugs flowed freely. Illegal immigration was rampant. Criminal immigrants, deported after committing crimes in America, returned the very next day to commit crimes again."" Gaetz accurately captured the party’s sentiment in the mid 1990s. More recent platforms have favored a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants",Mostly True,"February 13, 2019"
"""In 2018, we endured a school shooting nearly once a week.""","Florida Democrat Rep. Alcee Hastings criticized President Donald Trump for ignoring the topic of gun violence during his State of the Union address. Trump’s speech came nearly a week before the anniversary of the Feb. 14 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland that left 17 people dead. Lawmakers invited three fathers of children who died to watch Trump speak. Hastings, of nearby Boynton Beach, called on Trump to support gun control and cited a statistic about school shootings nationwide. ""In 2018, we endured a school shooting nearly once a week,"" Hastings said in a statement to the media. Hastings' spokesman told us he arrived at the one-shooting-per-week statistic by citing a database of school shootings compiled by Education Week, a national education publication. Hastings divided a 180-day school year by 24 shootings to arrive at one shooting every 7.5 days. It is not apparent from Hastings' statement that the underlying data lumps together various types of shootings on school property — everything from indiscriminate mass shootings to an accidental shooting. There is no consensus about how to define a school shooting. Some tallies include shootings in which someone was killed or injured, for example, while others may include only K-12 schools and not colleges and universities. ""No two school shootings are alike and therefore the circumstances surrounding each must be assessed and considered,"" stated a 2018 report by the Naval Postgraduate School Center for Homeland Defense and Security, which examined more than two dozen shooting databases. ""Choosing to include or exclude any of these criteria comes with a level of risk by directly affecting the statistical narrative on school shootings."" The count by Education Week includes 24 school shootings on K-12 school property that resulted in firearm-related injuries or deaths. Shootings that happened on school grounds during school or a school event are also counted. Suicides and self-inflicted injuries are not. Other groups arrive at higher totals by looking at every time a gun goes off on school property. A database from Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun control advocacy group, found at least 102 incidents of gunfire on school grounds, including K-12 as well as colleges, in 2018. The Naval Postgraduate School database found 97 school gun violence incidents in 2018, the most in any year. (In 2018, none of the incidents were only cases in which a gun was brandished; a gun went off each time.) Hastings' statement is on the lower end of these tallies, but that doesn't make it more precise. Experts offered some key caveats about Hastings’ statement and databases of school shootings. Jaclyn Schildkraut, an associate professor in the Department of Public Justice at the State University of New York at Oswego, said that Hastings’ statement omitted context that he was referring to an academic year. If he applied the same 24 shootings to a calendar year, it would have worked out to a shooting incident every other week. But Schildkraut and other experts have warned that it creates confusion when mass shootings are combined with other types of shootings that occur on school property — for example, two people getting into a fight after a school sporting event. Most of the shootings are not the indiscriminate mass shootings such as Parkland or Sante Fe. Schildkraut said she would consider about six on the list of 24 as school shootings. The database includes incidents such as two people shot in a fight outside a high school football game, a parent shot when a gun discharged accidentally in another parent’s pocket, and three students were injured when a teacher accidentally fired his gun in a classroom as he was teaching a gun safety lesson. These various types of shootings require different responses, Schildkraut said. ""We are not going to do a threat assessment on every person who goes to a football game, but we would on a troubled student,"" she said. While each loss of life by firearm is too many, ""the way we respond to events needs to actually take into account the totality of the situation and not only there was a gun at the school."" Education Week acknowledges the difficulty in coming up with a methodology. Staff writer Evie Blad explained that ""setting — and sticking with — a simple definition was more elusive than we expected."" Nine of the 24 school shootings determined by Education Week resulted in deaths — or about one per month in an academic year. ""In sum, the one-per-week statement can easily be misunderstood without such clarification,"" said James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University. While mass school shootings draw the most attention, the majority of children and teenagers killed by a gun are shot somewhere other than school, such as at home or on the streets. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that school-associated homicides consistently represent less than 2 percent of all youth homicides in the United States when examining data from 1994-2018. Hastings said, ""In 2018, we endured a school shooting nearly once a week."" He arrived at that figure by looking at the 24 school shootings documented by Education Week and dividing that into a 180-day school year. (If we applied the same math to a calendar year, it would work out to half that amount.) A statement about the number of school shootings warrants an explanation of what types of shootings were included. The Education Week database includes any K-12 shooting on a school property during school or a school event that resulted in injury or death. That means it includes both indiscriminate mass shootings as well as other types of incidents such as fights in a parking lot after a football game or an accidental shooting. Hastings’ statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details about the database he cited",Half True,"February 11, 2019"
"""Governor Evers, AG Josh Kaul, and Speaker Robin Vos are demanding ‘Red Flag Gun Seizures’ for Wisconsin, which would allow gun seizures with ""no proof, arrest, indictment, conviction or due process at all!""","Protesters gathered in front of the Capitol in Madison on Jan. 12, 2019 to tell Gov. Tony Evers to keep his laws off their guns. Indeed, some carried their guns openly. The point of the protest was to object to potential gun control measures the new governor might push, rally organizer Thomas Leager told PolitiFact Wisconsin. Bringing personal firearms, he said, allowed individuals to express their open-carry rights. A particular point of concern: So-called ""Red-flag"" laws. The day before the rally, the Wisconsin Firearms Coalition took its message on the laws to Facebook, stating: ""Governor Evers, AG Josh Kaul and Speaker Robin Vos are demanding ‘Red Flag Gun Seizures’ for Wisconsin!"" The post went on to say: ""This would allow virtually anyone to claim you're ‘dangerous’, having your firearms seized by law enforcement with no proof, arrest, indictment, conviction or due process at all!"" As of Jan. 23, 2019, the post had 6,500 shares, almost 7,000 likes and 2,000 comments. The Wisconsin Firearms Coalition is a nonprofit group that says it is ""dedicated to defending and advancing the 2nd Amendment rights of all law abiding citizens in the state of Wisconsin."" Along with Evers, a Democrat, its post cited newly elected Attorney General Josh Kaul, also a Democrat, and Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, a Republican. Is the group right that the three are ""demanding"" red-flag laws in Wisconsin? And that such laws allow guns to be seized with ""no proof, arrest, indictment, conviction or due process""? About the laws ""Red flag gun seizures"" refers to provisions that allow officials to take away firearms owned by people deemed to pose a threat to themselves or others. Family members or law enforcement officials have to petition a judge to temporarily restrict a person’s access to firearms. The term comes from the idea the person’s behavior amounts to a ""red flag"" for danger. Since the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., in February 2018, a total of 13 states have put such laws in place. When asked for backup for its claim via a Facebook message, the Wisconsin Firearms Coalition responded: ""The Attorney General’s comments were in his inaugural address, the governor came out the next day in support of red flags, and Statewide media reports that Robin Voss is willing to look at the idea a day or two after that."" Let’s start with the elected officials. Positions of elected officials In his Jan. 7, 2019 inaugural speech, Kaul called for taking steps to make schools safer, and mentioned red flag laws as one way to do so. Of red-flag laws, he said, they will ""allow law enforcement or family members to go to a judge and ensure that somebody who is a threat to themselves or others is temporarily disarmed."" In a story posted Jan. 10, 2019 on the website for Wausau-based WAOW-TV, Evers backed Kaul’s position and was quoted saying: ""Anytime we have an ability to take a firearm from somebody who may not be able to handle a firearm because of various in-capabilities, we need to investigate that."" The same article included this line: Republican Assembly speaker Robin Vos said he’s open to considering a red flag law, but is concerned about the rights of gun owners.

But that line, especially, is a far-cry from ""demanding"" the laws be put in place. Vos communications director Kit Beyer described the speaker as a staunch Second Amendment supporter and noted he has said he is ""fearful of taking away anyone’s constitutional rights"" when it comes to such laws. On Jan. 22, 2019, in a response to Evers’ State of the State address, Vos was more firm. ""I promise you: Republicans will fight for and protect your freedom, from unnecessary red flag gun laws,"" he said. So, the group’s claim is largely on the money with Evers and Kaul, but mischaracterizes Vos’ position. The bigger picture There are bigger problems with the main thrust of the claim -- that the laws would allow gun seizures with ""no proof, arrest, indictment, conviction or due process."" Adam Winkler, a law professor and specialist in constitutional law at the University of California, Los Angeles, said red-flag laws require a neutral arbiter to order confiscation of an individual’s firearms. ""A judge has to determine that a person is a threat,"" Winkler said. That undercuts the central thrust of the claim -- that there is zero oversight. That said, affected individuals could have their guns taken away temporarily without the ability to defend their position by appearing in court -- if a judge finds the concerns raised are severe enough. After the temporary period ends, the judge can review the case. At this stage, the individual would typically be involved in a hearing. Winkler said the laws are controversial, in part, because of due process concerns. ""You’re taking away fundamental rights without participation,"" he said. ""American courts are reluctant to take away guns unless (an individual) has been convicted of a crime."" So, the thrust of the claim overstates -- by a lot -- the way the laws work. Our rating A gun rights group claimed ""Governor Evers, AG Josh Kaul, and Speaker Robin Vos are demanding ""Red Flag Gun Seizures"" for Wisconsin"" which would allow gun seizures with ""no proof, arrest, indictment, conviction or due process at all!"" Though there is some truth to the claim, in that Kaul and Evers have clearly voiced support, the group was wrong about Vos’ position. The claim goes well beyond the facts in stating there is zero oversight of any action under such laws",Mostly False,"January 29, 2019"
"The NRA is ""one of the biggest lobbyists here in the capital. They spend a ton of money during elections. …  they spent more than a million dollars here in Wisconsin on the 2018 elections. Most of that was for Walker, or more specifically against Evers.""","The National Rifle Association is one of the most powerful lobbying groups in American politics. First chartered in New York in 1871, the association’s initial stated goal was to ""promote and encourage rifle shooting on a scientific basis."" Over the years, its focus expanded and eventually the group got political. Information on pending firearms-related legislation was included in the association's magazine, The American Rifleman; a Legislative Affairs Division was created in 1934. How does the NRA stack up against other lobbying groups today? Well, in January 2019, the Madison-based Wisconsin Democracy Campaign dubbed the NRA its ""Influence peddler of the month."" ""They (the NRA) are one of the biggest lobbyists here in the capital,"" said Matt Rothschild, the group’s executive director, in a Jan. 3, 2019 interview on WRRD 1510-AM’s ""Devil’s Advocates,"" a liberal talk radio program. ""They spend a ton of money during elections,"" he said. ""We just reported that they spent more than a million dollars here in Wisconsin on the 2018 elections. Most of that was for Walker, or more specifically against Evers."" The Democracy Campaign is a government watchdog group that tracks political contributions. Rothschild is referring, of course, to the election in which Democrat Tony Evers ousted Republican Gov. Scott Walker. But what about the many parts of his claim? Is he right? Looking at the claim When asked to back up Rothschild’s claim, Democracy Campaign researcher Michael Buelow pointed to the spending reports from the NRA’s Political Victory Fund, available on the webpage of the Wisconsin Campaign Finance Information System.  For our purposes, we are dividing the claim into four parts: The NRA is one of the biggest lobbyists in Madison According to a report from the Wisconsin Ethics Commission, titled ""Total Lobbying Expenditures Sorted by Total Dollars,"" the NRA spent $126,987 on lobbying for the period of January 2017 to June 2018 (the most recent data available online). That meant it ranked 109 out of 793 groups. But that is far from ""one of the biggest."" The top spender on lobbying, for instance, was Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce, which spent more than $1 million in that period. So that part of the claim falls short. That the NRA is among the biggest spenders on Wisconsin elections Rothschild used the phrase ""a ton of money."" In our minds, that means it is one of the biggest spenders on the election According to a November 2018 news release by the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign itself, here are the top 10 independent expenditure groups from the fall election: Americans for Prosperity -- $7.4 million Right Direction Wisconsin PAC (RGA Wisconsin) -- $6.5 million ACC Wisconsin PAC -- $4.3 million Wisconsin Freedom PAC -- $2.8 million Greater Wisconsin Political Independent Expenditure Fund -- $2.3 million DAGA WI People's Lawyer Project -- $2.1 million Wisconsin Conservation Voters Independent Expenditure Committee -- $1 million American Federation for Children Action Fund IE Committee Inc -- $971,133 NRA Political Victory Fund - Federal PAC -- $955,155 For Our Future -- $910,736 So the $955,155, puts the NRA at No. 9. But its tally is far below the $2.3 million that would put it in the Top 5, or the $7.4 million at the very top. So this part of the claim is off a bit as well. More than $1 million in spending in 2018 PolitiFact Wisconsin searched the Wisconsin Campaign Finance Information site 2018 entries for ""NRA Political Victory Fund -- Federal PAC"" and found the following: -- Spending against Evers: $872,915.46 -- Spending for Walker: $67,669.09 -- Spending for Michael Screnock (state Supreme Court candidate): $44,159.98 -- Spending for Brad Schimel (attorney general): $14,570.81 -- Spending for Andre Jacque (state Senate): $2,432.85 That is more than $1 million on elections in 2018, so that part of the claim hits the target. Most of the spending was for Walker or against Evers The final part of the claim also hits the mark -- of the more than $1 million total, $940,584 was either for Walker, or opposing Evers. Attempts to obtain comment from an NRA spokeswoman were unsuccessful. Our rating Rothschild said, the NRA is ""one of the biggest lobbyists here in the capital. They spend a ton of money during elections. … They spent more than a million dollars here in Wisconsin on the 2018 elections. Most of that was for Walker, or more specifically against Evers.""

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was sworn in only weeks ago and already she has a reputation for saying what she wants. But did she weigh in on whether gun ownership is enshrined in the U.S. Constitution? A Jan. 21 Facebook post claims the freshman lawmaker from Queens said ""owning guns IS NOT a right, if it were a right, it would be in the Constitution."" Other accounts made the same allegation, and their posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Ocasio-Cortez’s office did not immediately respond to an email from PolitiFact asking whether the quote was accurate. However, we didn’t find any credible sources corroborating the Facebook post. It's a hoax. Ocasio-Cortez’s campaign website features a platform that discusses her position on gun control. ""Cities and states with strong gun laws have managed to cut gun violence significantly without running afoul of the Second Amendment,"" the site says.  ""Alexandria believes that supporting common-sense gun legislation is necessary for any politician who claims to care about the lives of constituents."" The Second Amendment says that ""a well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed."" According to Ocasio-Cortez’s campaign platform, she thinks ""it’s clear that the founding fathers did not have assault weapons in mind when they wrote"" it, and advocates for banning such guns. Among other gun control measures, she thinks domestic abusers and stalkers should have to surrender their firearms, and she wants to require universal and improved background checks before someone can buy a gun.

"On extreme-risk guns laws, ""This idea has passed Republican legislatures in other states and has been signed by Republican governors.""","Gov, Ralph Northam endorsed a number a gun-control measures this year, but he promoted only one in his State of the Commonwealth Address to the gun-friendly General Assembly. ""This year I’m proposing we act to approve an ‘extreme risk law,’"" he said during the Jan. 9 speech. ""It creates a legal way for law enforcement and the courts to temporarily remove firearms from someone who has shown dangerous behavior, and who poses a risk to themselves or others. ""This idea has passed Republican legislatures in other states and been signed by Republican governors,"" Northam, a Democrat, said. He called for starting a ""dialogue"" between Democrats and Republicans on their often adverse views on gun restrictions. Northam’s gun-control package, which also included universal background checks and limiting handgun purchases to one a month, was defeated Jan. 17 by Republican majorities in a Senate committee and, later, a House subcommittee. We wondered whether Northam’s statement - that extreme-risk bills have passed in other states with Republican legislatures  and been signed by GOP governors - is accurate. Thirteen states have extreme-risk laws, also called red-flag laws. They allow police - and usually, family members - to petition a court to order the temporary removal of firearms from a person who may be dangerous to himself or others. After a set amount of time, the weapon is either returned to the person or the court order is extended. Supporters say the laws can prevent violent crimes and suicides. Opponents say the laws allow government seizure of firearms in violation of the Second Amendment. The National Rifle Association opposed the laws for many years, but in 2018 changed position and said it would back bills if they provide due process and require mental treatment for the person temporarily forfeiting his gun.

"""Hunters contribute more than $500 million"" to West Virginia.","In a tweet that preceded West Virginia’s buck firearm season, West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice encouraged West Virginians to purchase a hunting license. In the tweet, he offered an economic rationale -- that hunting is an economic engine for the state. In the Nov. 5 tweet, Justice wrote, ""I've said it before and I'll say it again, hunting is really something that can help our economy grow! Hunters contribute more than $500 million to our state each year and help support a lot of jobs. Get a license today at http://wvhunt.com . #WV #WVHunt.""

Get a license today at https://t.co/burilhQECG. #WV #WVHunt pic.twitter.com/btBNdz4TR6 State offices have thrown around the figure more than once. The West Virginia Division of Natural Resources sent a tweet on Nov. 24 that used the same dollar figure, adding that deer hunters in particular ""spend an estimated $230 million in West Virginia, much of it in the rural areas of the state."" We wondered: Do bucks, and other game, really bring the state 500 million bucks? When we contacted Justice’s office, Jordan Damron, the governor’s assistant legal counsel and digital director, cited it to the West Virginia Division of Natural Resources. A Nov. 14 press release from the division includes the $500 million figure and said that ""hunting is estimated to be responsible for 5,400 jobs and $35 million in sales taxes on goods and services spent in West Virginia."" The news release said the numbers came from Southwick Associates, a research firm focusing on outdoor markets. The Southwick Associates report said that there had been $421,819,113 in retail sales in West Virginia, with a ""multiplier effect"" raising that amount to $552,085,233. The multiplier was used  to estimate ""the total amount of spending that occurs in the economy as a result of hunters’ spending."" The report also said that 5,377 jobs were created through hunting and $35,544,522 in state and local taxes were gathered due to hunting. The amount spent on deer hunting alone was $291,972,745. So the numbers cited by Justice exist. But we’ll offer a few caveats. First, the report is from 2012 and the data is from 2011. Though Justice offered a specific-sounding figure, the actual figure might have grown or shrunk in the subsequent seven-plus years. Second, multiplier effects are estimates and are highly dependent on the assumptions used. Different assumptions will lead to different results. Using the retail sales figure without the multiplier adjustment might have been a more defensible approach. Finally, the report says it ""was funded by the National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF) and produced in partnership with the Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies."" The association represents government officials who oversee hunting, but the National Shooting Sports Foundation bills itself as the ""firearms industry trade association."" This means that the NSSF is an advocacy group that has a vested interest in promoting hunting. As with any advocacy group, its data should be understood in this context. Justice said that ""hunters contribute more than $500 million"" to West Virginia. This statistic comes from a comprehensive, 50-state report, but it’s worth noting that the data is more than seven years old, that it uses an estimate of economic impact beyond just retail sales, and that the report was funded by an industry trade group",Mostly True,"December 10, 2018"
"Says a manufacturing operation in his hometown that made gunstock for Remington rifles ""closed down, we lost those jobs and it's been devastating for my little town.""","In the Oct. 25 debate between Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley and Sen. Claire McCaskill, an audience member asked about businesses and jobs moving out of the country. Hawley, who is vying for McCaskill’s Senate seat, sought to explain how that issue was personal to him. ""The rural town that I grew up in — Lexington, Missouri, it's not too far from here — we used to have a manufacturing operation in that town, made the gunstock for Remington rifles, I believe it was,"" he said. ""And that plant closed down, we lost those jobs and it's been devastating for my little town."" We wanted to know more about Hawley’s story. Was it true that a gunstock manufacturing operation closed, taking away jobs? Gunstock manufacturer S&K Industries, a gunstock manufacturing company founded by Roy Stout in 1961. In 1986, S&K picked up Remington Arms as a client. The family business had three locations in Lexington, said Penny Grosso, executive director of the Lexington Chamber of Cmmerce. Remington went on to buy two of them, said city administrator Joe Aull. (We confirmed one facility’s purchase happened in September 2009, according to a 2010 air pollution permit with the Missouri Department of Natural Resources.) We wondered how the sale might have led to a facility closure or lost jobs. Finding the answer was more complicated than we thought. Multiple calls to Remington Arms Company’s national press office were not returned. Former S&K president Thomas Stout could not be reached. The Hawley campaign did not respond. After checking past records and speaking with a longtime plant worker, Aull said S&K never shut down its facilities before the sale. The third site, at 8th and Main streets, was not part of the Remington sale. We found another 2010 air pollution permit for S&K to operate a ""new wood trophy parts and plaque painting process"" on that location. That permit noted S&K previously housed a gunstock manufacturing facility there. But, ""the operation was shut down in December 2008"" and the original permit eventually expired. It should be noted that from 2008 to the sale, S&K was still selling gunstocks, per many posts on an online forum for gun owners, suggesting the other locations were still in operation. As a postscript: Lexington’s Remington Arms almost closed down, but in 2017 received a $1.6 million state grant for upgrades to its plant in return for promising that the company would employ at least 80 people and stay in town for another five years. Hawley said that the gunstock manufacturing plant in his hometown of Lexington ""closed down."" Of the three S&K Industries locations in Lexington, one site shut down for gunstock manufacturing, but the rest continued operations and were purchased by Remington Arms without much hassle. So technically, Hawley is right, but it was just one facility, not an entire business. His statement overstates the effect, making it seem like the manufacturing business left town or was shuttered",Half True,"November 5, 2018"
"Says Claire McCaskill ""voted against including health records in the background check system.""","Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley told Missouri residents on live television that U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill voted against the inclusion of mental health records in gun background checks. ""The (national background check system) doesn’t work that well because there’s a giant loophole right in the middle of it. It doesn’t include mental health records,"" Hawley said during the second Senate debate. ""Congress could have done this, they’ve had the chance to do it, but they haven’t."" ""Sen. McCaskill voted against including health records in the background check system. I think that was wrong,"" Hawley said. ""I know it was along the party line, but I think that was wrong."" We’ve fact-checked other politicians’ statements on gun control legislation in the past, including some specifically related to firearm access for people with a history of mental illness. McCaskill has received an ""F"" rating from the National Rifle Association and taken $156,949 from gun control political action committees this election cycle, according to the nonprofit, nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. McCaskill maintained during the debate that she supports and has voted for universal background checks. So has she or hasn’t she voted against including mental health records as part of the gun-purchasing background check process? Hawley’s evidence for McCaskill’s disapproval of including mental health records in the background check system was her vote against a 2016 amendment to the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 2016. Sponsored by Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, the proposal was one of four that came in the wake of a mass shooting at an Orlando nightclub, where a gunman killed 49 people. Grassley’s 2016 amendment would have incentivized states to submit relevant mental health records to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. ""The Democrats put the kibosh on a bill that, on its face, would have strengthened (to some degree) populating NICS database with names of persons ineligible to purchase guns on account of a mental illness disqualifier,"" said Jacob James, a professor of constitutional law and director of the Center for Research in Crime and Justice at New York University, in an email. James said that Grassley’s amendment likely didn’t pass muster with Democrats like McCaskill ""because they favored a stronger gun control bill, which had no chance of passage."" Indeed, some of the leading opponents of the amendment said at the time that it did not go far enough in keeping guns out of the hands of criminals and suspected terrorists. ""It was dangerous and reckless,"" said Jonas Oransky, legal director for Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun control  organization that rallied against the amendment. Oransky called it a decoy to meaningful gun control legislation that would have ""invalidated hundreds of thousands of existing mental health records already in the background check system."" Representatives from gun rights advocacy groups, including the National Rifle Association, which backed Grassley’s amendment, did not immediately respond to PolitiFact’s request for comment. The 2016 vote was similar to a failed 2013 measure co-sponsored by Grassley and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. McCaskill voted against that one, too. McCaskill voted in favor of an amendment to the Safe Communities, Safe Schools Act of 2013. Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Pat Toomey, R-Pa., sponsored the piece, which would have expanded background checks to gun shows and internet sales, and allotted grants ""to improve the automation and transmittal of mental health records and criminal history dispositions."" It also would have created a commission of experts charged with studying mass violence, including the role of mental health issues. The Manchin-Toomey amendment died in a Senate filibuster. In 2016, as McCaskill voted no on the Grassley amendment, she voted yes on another amendment co-sponsored by Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., known as the Fix Gun Checks Act of 2016. Its purpose was to ensure that ""all individuals who should be prohibited from buying a firearm are listed in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System and require a background check for every firearm sale."" Though it, too, failed to pass, the amendment also included guidelines on how to define and include relevant mental health records in the national background check system. ""Sen. McCaskill has consistently and repeatedly supported legislation to improve the federal background check system,"" said Max Samis, press secretary for gun control Brady Campaign and Center to Prevent Gun Violence.* Samis along with McCaskill’s campaign noted McCaskill’s co-sponsorship of a bill called the Fix NICS ACT of 2017, which aims to incentivize states to submit relevant records to the nationwide criminal background check system. After a gunman murdered 17 people at a high school in Parkland, Florida, last February, McCaskill joined other members of Congress in saying that proposal was a start, she saw a need for gun legislation that went further. ""It’s an important little step, but surely we can do more than the teeniest, tiniest steps right now,"" McCaskill told Politico earlier this year. Hawley said McCaskill ""voted against including (mental) health records in the background check system."" Hawley is isolating one vote from a GOP proposal while ignoring McCaskill’s full record in the Senate. McCaskill clearly has supported efforts to tighten restrictions for who can purchase a firearm, including measures that clearly addressed the inclusion of mental health records in the gun background check system and more aggressive overall provisions for regulating gun sales",Mostly False,"November 1, 2018"
"An agreement between the city of Chicago and the ACLU caused ""virtually all of the rise in homicides"" in 2016.","Like President Donald Trump, who has claimed Chicago could solve its violence problem ""in a week"" by employing tougher tactics, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions frequently criticizes the city for policies he says hamstring its cops. In a speech to a law enforcement audience in Chicago on Friday, Sessions once again blamed the city’s 2016 spike in murders on an agreement between the Emanuel administration and the American Civil Liberties Union that reined in stop-and-frisk policing. ""As a result of the agreement ... Chicago saw the biggest single-year increase in murders since we’ve had reliable statistics,"" Sessions said. ""Former federal judge Paul Cassell and Professor Richard Fowles of the University of Utah examined what happened here, considered a number of possible causes, and found that the cause of virtually all of the rise in homicides was the ACLU agreement."" We fact-checked Sessions when he made virtually the same claim back in May. It’s still Mostly False. Here’s why. Chicago entered an agreement with the ACLU to end its reliance on stop-and-frisk policing after the civil rights group threatened to take legal action. By 2016, the agreement was in full effect. The agreement followed the release of a report by ACLU’s Illinois chapter that found Chicagoans were stopped more than four times as often as New Yorkers were before that city years earlier reined in its stop-and-frisk policing. The Chicago agreement determined that going forward officers here would be trained to stop people for questioning only when there was a ""reasonable suspicion of criminal conduct."" The city also imposed more thorough documentation requirements for every stop made. Cassell, a former federal judge and current law professor, and Richard Fowles, an economics professor, found that street stops by Chicago police decreased sharply following the agreement — from 40,000 monthly down to less than 10,000 per month. The study attributed the significant uptick in homicides during the same time, from 480 in 2015 to 754 in 2016, to that decline in stops. But experts we spoke with in May pointed to a number of flaws in the study, including its limited time frame and the fact that violent crime has declined or held steady in other cities that have backed away from stop-and-frisk policing. Following the 2016 murder spike in Chicago, murders declined by 15 percent in 2017 — the steepest one-year reduction in nearly 15 years. And that figure is down again for 2018, dropping by a quarter since this time last year, according to data tracked by the Chicago Tribune. Those declines occurred even though the city continues to follow the agreement with the ACLU. Sessions’ argument is also weakened by the results in other cities that have taken similar steps to those in Chicago. During his remarks, Sessions held up New York as a law enforcement success story, pointing to significant progress made in tamping down violent crime there over the last few decades. ""Last weekend there were zero murders in New York City for the first time in 25 years,"" Sessions said. ""In fact, there were no shootings at all in New York City last weekend."" Sessions is right that today’s New York is much less violent than in years’ past. But the Big Apple makes for a curious pick in defending stop-and-frisk. A federal judge ruled in 2013 that the way NYPD officers were stopping New Yorkers was unconstitutional, requiring them to change tactics. Even prior to the verdict, the department’s reliance on street stops was in decline. By the end of 2013, stops by police had plummeted from a 2011 high of more than 200,000 to 12,500. By Sessions’ logic, curtailing stop-and-frisk should have triggered a murder spike like Chicago’s. Yet murders in New York have declined or held steady in the years since the federal ruling. Newark, Seattle and Philadelphia have also limited police stops in recent years without a corresponding jump in murders. Meanwhile, even when Chicago was still stopping individuals at four times the rate of New York’s peak, gun seizures here dropped, detectives solved fewer murders and a decade-long decline in gun violence came to an end, a 2016 WBEZ investigation found. The Utah research report that underpins Sessions’ conclusions blames the upsurge in murders on the ACLU agreement but dismisses any possibility it could be related to the intense local reaction to the late 2015 release of police dashcam footage that showed officer Jason Van Dyke shooting black teenager Laquan McDonald 16 times. Van Dyke was convicted of second-degree murder earlier this month. In response to the fallout from the video’s release, Mayor Rahm Emanuel fired police chief Garry McCarthy in late 2015. McCarthy, who came to Chicago by way of the Newark and New York police departments, ran the Chicago department during the years when stops in this city outpaced New York’s. Sessions said an agreement between the city of Chicago and the ACLU caused ""virtually all of the rise in homicides"" in 2016. His claim repeats a finding from a University of Utah study that attributed Chicago’s 2016 murder spike to an agreement between the city and the civil rights group meant to rein in the city’s stop-and-frisk tactics. Chicago’s murder toll did skyrocket that year, though it has declined since. The study has been criticized for its methods and for excluding other factors that could have played a role. There is an element of truth in Sessions’ claim, but it also ignores critical facts that would give a different impression",Mostly False,"October 23, 2018"
"Sen. Joe Manchin ""stands with Hillary Clinton and D.C. Dems on gun control, higher taxes, amnesty, and Planned Parenthood.""","In his battle to unseat U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., Republican state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey is working hard to paint Manchin as a captive of his party even though West Virginia voters strongly back President Donald Trump. In a tweet on Aug. 31, Morrisey said, ""On life, guns, tax cuts, and coal, I stand with President @realDonaldTrump and West Virginia. Meanwhile, lying liberal Joe Manchin stands with Hillary Clinton and DC Dems on gun control, higher taxes, amnesty and Planned Parenthood. The choice could not be more clear. #WVsen."" On life, guns, tax cuts, and coal, I stand with President @realDonaldTrump and West Virginia. Meanwhile, lying liberal Joe Manchin stands with Hillary Clinton and DC Dems on gun control, higher taxes, amnesty, and Planned Parenthood. The choice could not be more clear. #WVsen In this fact-check, we’ll look at whether Morrisey had a point about Manchin’s stances on guns, taxes, immigration and Planned Parenthood. Manchin once received strong support from the National Rifle Association. But that’s not the case any more. In 2004, when Manchin was running for governor, he received an A-plus rating from the NRA and received the group’s endorsement when running for governor. And in 2010 and 2012, when Manchin was running for a U.S. Senate seat, he was endorsed by the NRA and received an A rating. ""Joe Manchin is committed to protecting the Right to Keep and Bear Arms guaranteed to all Americans,"" Chris Cox, chairman of the NRA Political Victory Fund, wrote in 2012. But Manchin’s relations with the NRA soured in 2013 after he and Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., proposed legislation that would have enacted tighter background checks for certain gun purchases. Manchin and Toomey framed the bill as a compromise, but the NRA saw it as the first step down a slippery slope and opposed it. (It never became law.) This year, the NRA gave Manchin a D and said it was airing ads on behalf of Morrisey in the Charleston and Bluefield markets. ""Contrary to what Joe Manchin says in West Virginia, he has supported the agenda of Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer by voting in favor of gun control in Washington, D.C.,"" Cox wrote this year. In an interview on CBS news in March 2018 — in the wake of the school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. — Manchin defended his position as ""not gun control. It’s gun sense. … This bill of ours, the Manchin-Toomey bill, should be the base bill they work off of."" He also has signaled support for banning bump stocks and raising the legal age of purchasing assault rifles. Manchin added that he would not support a ban on AR-15s. When he was asked about the possibility of the ban, he said, ""I don’t have any friends that own the gun right now, I don’t know anyone who’s committed a crime with it, so I wouldn’t take their gun away."" ""Joe Manchin supports protecting West Virginians’ Second Amendment rights,"" said Manchin spokesman Grant Herring. ""Manchin is a lifetime NRA member. Manchin opposed banning assault weapons and sponsored and voted for legislation allowing concealed-carry reciprocity.""  The biggest tax vote in recent years came in December 2017, when the Senate considered a bill backed by President Trump and the GOP-controlled House that made major tax cuts and enacted other changes to the tax code. Manchin, like the chamber’s other Democrats, voted against passage, but the bill received enough Republican support to become law. Manchin’s vote against the bill isn’t exactly a vote for ""higher taxes"" — it was a vote to keep the status quo on taxes — but he did pass up the opportunity to lower taxes for many Americans, so this charge has some validity. Previously, we’ve reported that in 2012, Manchin voted for the ""Buffett Rule,"" which would have imposed a minimum effective tax rate for high-income taxpayers. He also supported legislation offered by the Bowles-Simpson commission, which was an attempt to balance the budget in a way that included tax increases as well as spending cuts. In 2013, Manchin voted in favor of the ""Gang of Eight"" bill that, among other things, would have set up a path to legal status and an eventual opportunity for citizenship. The ""Gang of Eight"" refers to a bipartisan group of eight senators — four Democrats and four Republicans — Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., Marco Rubio, R-Fla., Lindsey Graham, R- S.C., and John McCain R-Ariz. It was endorsed by former President Barack Obama. The bill passed the Senate, 68-32, with 14 Republicans joining 54 Democrats and Democratic-caucusing independent senators in voting for it. (The bill did not get a hearing in the House and never became law.) Manchin was one of the Democrats who voted for it. But did it amount to amnesty? As we’ve concluded in the past, defining ""amnesty"" is tricky. Some view it as blanket permission for undocumented immigrants to remain in the United States, while others view amnesty as any measure that is favorable to any undocumented immigrants, even if it includes a list of tough measures they have to meet. Republicans who supported the legislation, along with most Democrats, argued that the bill did not offer amnesty. At the time, we concluded that the bill did not offer blanket legal residency to unauthorized immigrants. It mandated fines, background checks and waiting periods and was tougher than a 1986 law that was more in line with a traditional definition of ""amnesty."" ""This bill includes numerous punishments for unauthorized immigrants who broke the laws, including paying fines and other legal sanctions,"" Alex Nowrasteh with the libertarian Cato Institute told PolitiFact in 2013. ""If it was amnesty they would be legalized immediately with no punishment, no process. They would just be forgiven and handed a green card."" Since then, Manchin has sought to find a middle ground in the Senate. However, facing a tough reelection campaign in a solidly pro-Trump state, he has often emphasized his stance on toughening border security. We need more border patrol agents, drones, towers, ground sensors, thermal imaging, and Blackhawk helicopters at the border to ensure there is complete surveillance. In a press release from February 2018 — after the Senate failed to reach agreement on legislation protecting undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children, along with new investments in border security — Manchin said, ""I share the president's commitment to border security. That’s why I voted for his plan."" Herring, his spokesman, added that Manchin ""also supports Kate's Law, which would increase penalties for criminals who re-enter the country illegally."" The national health and family-planning clinic network has been a longtime target of anti-abortion groups because it provides abortion services. By law, federal money cannot be used to pay for abortion services, but federal dollars do flow to Planned Parenthood for other purposes — something that rankles opponents of abortion, who say that money is fungible. We have previously looked at what Manchin has said and done about Planned Parenthood. Critics pointed to photos Manchin took with constituents carrying pro-Planned Parenthood signs, although he has also taken photos with supporters carrying anti-Planned Parenthood signs.  Manchin has said that he’s personally anti-abortion but supports federal funding for Planned Parenthood as long as the funding comports with existing federal law. In a statement to PolitiFact, Herring said that Manchin ""has always been pro-life. Planned Parenthood doesn’t receive taxpayer money for abortions. The only Planned Parenthood in WV provides basic health care services and screenings, and Sen. Manchin doesn’t want to take away health care from women."" Morrisey said Manchin ""stands with Hillary Clinton and DC Dems on gun control, higher taxes, amnesty, and Planned Parenthood."" We’re not entirely sure what Hillary Clinton has to do with this, but Morrisey can point to some evidence to support Manchin’s loyalty to Democratic orthodoxy in each of these four areas. That said, Morrisey glosses over important nuances. On guns and immigration, for instance, Manchin has often worked with Republicans to find common ground, rather than taking a strong Democratic line. On taxes, Manchin did vote against the Trump-backed tax bill, but his position would have left the tax code the same, rather than imposing ""higher taxes."" And Morrisey ignores Manchin’s personal anti-abortion position in focusing on Manchin’s support for Planned Parenthood; Manchin supports the status quo on federal funding, which is to provide it only for non-abortion services",Half True,"October 4, 2018"

The NRA is the National Rifle Association, the nation’s largest gun-rights group, while Obama is former President Barack Obama and Schumer is Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. Joe Manchin has a ""D"" rating from the NRA, and fought alongside Obama and Schumer for anti-gun legislation. Lying liberal Joe abandoned our Second Amendment values and disrespected West Virginia gun owners. #WVsen pic.twitter.com/jvmf9IOJV4   Here, we’ll focus on the NRA rating for Manchin. In a news release, the NRA said Manchin has earned a D rating from the group this year. In the same news release, the group said it was endorsing Morrisey and airing ads on his behalf in the Charleston and Bluefield markets. ""Contrary to what Joe Manchin says in West Virginia, he has supported the agenda of Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer by voting in favor of gun control in Washington, D.C.,"" said Chris Cox, chairman of the NRA Political Victory Fund. So it’s clear that the NRA has given Manchin a D rating this year. But the group hasn’t always been so negative about Manchin -- something the ad glosses over. In 2004, when Manchin was running for governor, he received an ""A+"" rating from the NRA and received the group’s endorsement when running for governor. And in 2010 and 2012, when Manchin was running for a U.S. Senate seat, he was endorsed by the NRA and received an ""A"" rating. ""Joe Manchin is committed to protecting the Right to Keep and Bear Arms guaranteed to all Americans,"" Cox wrote in 2012. Manchin’s relations with the NRA soured in 2013 after he and Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., proposed legislation that would have enacted tighter background checks for certain gun purchases. The NRA Political Victory Fund website doesn’t allow for searches of past ratings, although it once did, the Washington Post reported in June 2018. Asked by the Post for the rationale for removing past grades, Jennifer Baker, an NRA spokeswoman, said, ""I don’t understand — why are you asking? What does it matter to you? The grades are not relevant after the election."" Morrisey tweeted that ""Joe Manchin has a ‘D’ rating from the NRA."" That’s certainly the case for 2018, and the NRA has endorsed Morrisey over Manchin this year.

"""We passed the toughest gun control law in the United States of America, the SAFE Act.""","In his campaign for re-election, Gov. Andrew Cuomo faces a primary challenge from Cynthia Nixon, and he points to his record as proof that he can be a line of defense against President Trump’s policies. Part of Cuomo’s record is the Secure Ammunition and Firearms Enforcement Act, often referred to as the SAFE Act. ""We passed the toughest gun control law in the United States of America, the SAFE Act,"" Cuomo said at the Democratic gubernatorial primary debate at Hofstra University. ""He will roll it back with his Supreme Court. He has to be stopped,"" Cuomo said of Trump. Cuomo has called the SAFE Act the nation’s toughest gun control legislation several times since he signed it into law in January 2013. He includes a similar claim on his campaign website. So is Cuomo right? Is the SAFE Act the nation’s toughest gun control law? Background New York was the first state to pass major gun control legislation after a gunman fatally shot 20 children and six adults on Dec. 14, 2012, at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. Cuomo used a message of necessity to hasten passage of the law. The SAFE Act has several provisions, including a ban on certain semiautomatic weapons, a requirement that ammunition be purchased through a dealer who performs a background check on the buyer, and background checks for buyers who purchase guns through private sales. The act also included provisions to keep guns away from people with mental illness. The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence called it a ""model for the nation."" Some of the law’s provisions were challenged in court, including a provision that magazine capacity be seven rounds instead of 10, which a federal judge struck down. Other legal challenges to the law were not successful. Though the SAFE Act was controversial in parts of the state, Cuomo has continued to pursue gun control policies during his tenure. His actions have attracted negative attention from the country’s most powerful gun rights group, the National Rifle Association, as he pursues a third term. But is it the toughest?  Cuomo calls the SAFE Act the toughest gun legislation in the country. News outlets echoed that language when it was passed. The New York law ranks as the nation’s toughest by virtue of ""mandating universal background checks, creating a first-of-its-kind mental health database, closing the gun-show loophole, and strengthening the state’s ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines,"" said Cuomo spokeswoman Abbey Collins.  At least one gun control research think tank considers the SAFE Act the most comprehensive measure passed in 2013. The Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, which tracks legislation around the country and assists lawmakers in crafting gun control measures, characterized ""the SAFE Act as the most comprehensive law"" enacted that year because it included ""many different areas of gun violence prevention, more so than any other law enacted that year,"" according to a statement from Jason Phelps, the law center’s national press secretary. Phelps declined to use ""toughest"" to describe the law. He said the word is subjective and could have different meanings to different people and organizations. ""Accordingly, we do not think it is unfair or inaccurate for Gov. Cuomo to characterize the SAFE Act as the toughest law enacted that year,"" Phelps said. But that is not the whole story.      In several scorecards rating states for gun laws, New York does not come in first, either in 2013 or in later years, for the toughest. The Brady Campaign and Giffords Law Center’s joint 2013 evaluation of state gun laws puts New York in fifth place for strongest laws, after California, Connecticut, New Jersey, and Maryland. New York moved up from sixth place on Giffords’ 2012 state scorecard. Giffords also ranked New York fifth in its most recent ranking.   In the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence’s most recent evaluation of the ""strongest"" state laws, published in March 2015, New York also came in fifth, after California, Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Jersey. Giffords and the Brady Campaign have endorsed Cuomo in his re-election bid. Our ruling Cuomo claims New York enacted the toughest gun law.

"Says he was sued by the NRA and the gun lobby ""all because in my city we refused to repeal an ordinance which said you couldn’t shoot guns in city parks.""","Speaking about recent mass shootings in Florida, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum called for the enforcement of ""common sense gun laws"" and touted his own fight against the National Rifle Association. ""I was literally sued, drug through court for two years by the NRA and the gun lobby, all because in my city we refused to repeal an ordinance which said you couldn’t shoot guns in city parks,"" Gillum, Tallahassee’s mayor, said in an Aug. 29 interview on MSNBC’s The Last Word with Lawrence O’Donnell. Gillum is competing against Ron DeSantis, a pro-Trump Republican congressman, in the race to become Florida’s next governor. The election is Nov. 6. Gillum is right — he and other Tallahassee elected officials were sued because they did not repeal an ordinance prohibiting the discharge of firearms in public parks. But he left out some context. The NRA supported the lawsuit filed by gun rights advocates, but it was not a party to it. Courts allowed the ordinance to remain on the books, since a 1987 state law effectively declared it ""null and void"" and the ordinance wasn’t being enforced. Two groups advocating for gun rights, Florida Carry, Inc. and the Second Amendment Foundation, filed a lawsuit in May 2014 against the city of Tallahassee, then-Mayor John Marks and several city commissioners, including Gillum, who served on the commission at the time. (He was sworn in as mayor November 2014.) The NRA did not sue. But it filed an amicus brief supporting Florida Carry and the Second Amendment Foundation. ""Mayor Gillum knows the NRA is not suing him, but he also knows he wouldn’t get much attention by crying out that a small Florida group and another from Bellevue, Washington, have taken him to court,"" Marion P. Hammer, former NRA president wrote in an opinion piece published by the Tallahassee Democrat in January 2017. Second Amendment Foundation and Florida Carry said they were suing Tallahassee and its elected officials for ""refusing to repeal ordinances restricting the use of firearms in defiance of Florida’s firearms preemption law."" The lawsuit claimed that the ordinances (one from 1957 and another from 1984, amended in 1988) had been reprinted without being amended, and infringed on the Florida Legislature’s intent to provide uniform firearm laws across the state. A 1987 Florida law gave the state the exclusive power to regulate firearms and ammunition, and deemed ""null and void"" related local ordinances and regulations. The legislature in 2011 doubled down on the law by allowing penalties against local officials who enacted or enforced firearm regulations. The 1957 provision said, ""No person shall discharge any firearms except in areas five acres or larger zoned for agricultural uses."" The ordinance amended in 1988 made it ""unlawful for any person to discharge a firearm in a park or recreational facility owned, managed, maintained, or controlled by the city,"" the lawsuit said. It added that Gillum and other commissioners in February 2014 voted in favor of indefinitely tabling a repeal discussion. The city of Tallahassee, in a filing to dismiss the lawsuit, argued that Florida Carry and the Second Amendment Foundation had ""no clear legal right to compel"" city commissioners to repeal the ordinances and that since the legislature had rendered the ordinances invalid, ""nothing else is required."" Nonetheless, the case moved forward. A circuit court judge, George S. Reynolds, III, ultimately sided with the city, saying that the city’s actions did not enact or cause the ordinances to be enforced. ""While cleaning up the city code so that old city ordinances which are no longer legal, relevant, or enforced are removed may be good public policy, it remains the city’s prerogative – not the plaintiffs, nor this court’s,"" Reynolds wrote in his November 2015 opinion. The groups appealed to the Florida 1st District Court of Appeal. But the appeals court in February 2017 also ruled in favor of the city. While the ordinances ""may still be ‘on the books,’ they are unenforceable and invalid,"" the court’s opinion said. Gillum said that he was sued by the NRA and the gun lobby ""all because in my city we refused to repeal an ordinance which said you couldn’t shoot guns in city parks."" Gillum was among Tallahassee elected officials sued by two gun rights groups for not repealing a decades-old ordinance restricting the use of firearms in city parks. The local ordinance had been deemed null and void by a state law and not been enforced. The NRA supported the groups and filed an amicus brief, but it was not a formal party in the litigation. Other gun rights groups were the plaintiffs. Gillum’s statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information",Mostly True,"September 5, 2018"
"""It appears that the (Jacksonville) shooter was part of the Trump 'Resistance'.""","In an attempt to find a motive behind a deadly shooting at a video game tournament in Jacksonville, Fla., some conservative commentators misidentified the assailant as part of a political opposition movement against President Donald Trump.

"""If you are a gun store owner and you decide to go out of business … you right now are allowed to convert your entire gun store inventory to ‘personal use’ and once it is a personal use weapon, you can sell it without background checks.""","The so-called ""gun show loophole,"" which says private individuals can sell their guns without conducting a federal background check, has come under increased scrutiny in recent years. Speaking at a community center on Chicago’s South Side following the city’s most violent weekend this year, Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth added another wrinkle to that criticism by highlighting an implication of the law that hasn’t received as much attention. ""If you are a gun store owner and you decide to go out of business—you retire, you don’t want to do this anymore for whatever reason—you right now are allowed to convert your entire gun store inventory to ‘personal use,’"" Duckworth said. ""And once it is a personal use weapon, you can sell it without background checks."" The first-term Illinois senator made the comment while expressing her support for federal legislation that would require universal background checks for gun purchases, a policy which polls show more than 80 percent of Americans support. The federal government places few restrictions on private sales by people who aren’t legally considered gun dealers. But could a former gun store owner really sell off the remainder of his or her inventory—a veritable arsenal, potentially—without running afoul of the law? The short answer: Yes, generally speaking. PolitiFact Rhode Island rated as True a similar claim in 2013. The more interesting question is why. Former gun dealers who no longer are licensed to sell guns have the same legal right to sell guns as any other private citizen. The federal rules for private sellers state they can’t give or sell a firearm to someone they know or reasonably believe is prohibited from owning a gun. They also can’t sell or transport firearms across state lines. But that’s pretty much it—although 19 states have instituted their own background check requirements beyond federal law. Illinois, for instance, requires all firearm purchasers to obtain a state permit, which can only be issued after a background check. But when a federally licensed gun dealer sells a gun in any state, the buyer must go through a background check. And the law says anyone who repeatedly buys and sells guns ""with the principal motive of making a profit"" must obtain such a license from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, or ATF. That’s different than occasionally buying and selling guns to enhance or liquidate a collection. So how do guns from a retailer’s business inventory wind up in their personal collection? Federal rules permit licensed dealers to transfer firearms out of their business inventory and into their personal collection—whether they are planning on leaving the trade or not. If they maintain their license, those weapons must sit in their collection for a year before they can be sold in a private, potentially background check-free transaction. If they let their license lapse or it is revoked, they become just like any other private individual, meaning their property and sales no longer fall under the ATF’s purview—unless, of course, they cross the line by buying and selling in a way that resembles doing business. According to Mark Jones, project director for the National Law Enforcement Partnership to Prevent Gun Violence and a former ATF agent, the burden of proof for that crime is high. ""It’s a pretty big mountain to climb to go after an FFL (federal firearm licensee) and prove that they’re actually criminally culpable or to go after someone who’s not an FFL but who’s dealing without a license,"" said Jones. A particularly striking case from 2006 illustrates that point. Sanford Abrams, a Maryland gun store owner and National Rifle Association board member, had his license revoked for a litany of violations, including that he couldn’t account for more than a quarter of his inventory. Between 1996 and 2000, 483 guns that were used in crimes were traced back to Abrams’ store, according to a report from the Brady Center. Yet Abrams maintained he could continue selling off his inventory as part of his personal collection. And in June 2006, the ATF affirmed that he could do so because he would only be acting as a dealer if he repeatedly purchased and resold firearms. Duckworth said former firearms dealers can transfer guns from their inventory into their personal collections, and then sell those guns without background checks. Federal law permits gun dealers to transfer inventory to their personal collections, and private gun sales under federal law do not require background checks. Many states, including Illinois, have added their own requirements, though. A former dealer—and any other private individual—could still get into trouble by continuing to buy and sell with profit as their main motive rather than enhancing or liquidating their collection. But there’s no definitive legal yardstick—such as the number of guns sold—for determining compliance. Duckworth’s statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing",True,"August 26, 2018"
"Says Donald Trump contradicted his own administration when he said the decision to allow blueprints for 3D-printed guns to be distributed ""doesn’t seem to make much sense.""","A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order to block the online publication of blueprints outlining how to create untraceable and undetectable 3D-printed firearms. The blueprints were originally scheduled for an Aug. 1 release after a government settlement ended five years of litigation. But word of the release prompted panic as legislators and officials scrambled to block the action. Before the federal judge’s ruling, at least 21 attorneys general filed suit to stop the blueprints from going live. As conversation heated up, President Donald Trump weighed in on Twitter. ""I am looking into 3-D Plastic Guns being sold to the public,"" he said. ""Already spoke to NRA, doesn’t seem to make much sense!""  I am looking into 3-D Plastic Guns being sold to the public. Already spoke to NRA, doesn’t seem to make much sense! Politicians and pundits jumped at the president’s words as proof that he was unfamiliar with a decision from his own administration. ""Trump: My own administration’s latest decision ‘doesn’t seem to make much sense!’"" said a July 31 headline from Addicting Info, a liberal website. This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Trump’s last-minute statement gave us pause, too, so we decided to look at the settlement. Was the Trump administration — or Trump — actually behind it? The White House did not respond to a request for comment (though Trump's press secretary said later that he did not get a chance to weigh in). So we searched elsewhere for our answer. On May 5, 2013, Defense Distributed uploaded blueprints online that could be used to make a working 3D-printed gun called ""The Liberator,"" as well as a 53-second video of founder Cody Wilson firing one. Wilson soon received a letter from the Obama administration’s State Department demanding that he remove the files from the internet. The letter said the ""technical data"" amounted to an illegal gun export in violation of the Arms Export Control Act and International Traffic in Arms Regulations, because it could be accessed in countries where the United States does not sell weapons. The State Department instructed Wilson to take down the files until he applied for specific approval of the gun’s multiple components. By that point, the blueprints had already been downloaded 100,000 times. In response, Wilson filed a lawsuit against the State Department with the help of Second Amendment Foundation, a guns-rights organization, in which he sought a preliminary injunction to allow continued publication of the gun files online. Under both the Obama and Trump administrations, the government stuck by its assertion that the ""technical data"" constituted an illegal gun export. Wilson countered that the government’s intervention violated his First Amendment right to free speech. Ultimately, district and appeals courts both rejected Wilson’s injunction request. But as the case turned to the First Amendment claim, the government made an unexpected settlement offer. With the settlement, reached in June and announced July 10, the government waived the relevant export restrictions and allowed Wilson to post the blueprints online as early as Aug. 1. Specifically, the State Department announced that it was ""in the interest of the security and foreign policy of the United States"" to temporarily modify the U.S. Munitions List to exclude the technical data for the 3-D-printed guns. Defense-related items on the munitions list face tight restrictions, because they offer a critical military or intelligence advantage to the United States. The U.S. Commerce Department manages a separate export list with fewer restrictions. It is not clear what role Trump or the White House played in the settlement decision, though White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said during an Aug. 1 press briefing that the Department of Justice instructed the State Department to settle without White House approval. The State Department has said that its role in this issue relates solely to regulation of exports of certain types of firearms and any related technical data. But the move to shift the 3D-printed guns’ technical data outside of the State Department’s purview was not without precedent. The government’s decision came amid a longstanding but relatively behind-the-scenes administrative project — started under the Obama administration and known as ""export control reform"" — to restructure the regulations governing exports of weapons and technologies. Just as the litigation against Wilson can be traced back to the Obama years, so, too, can the export control changes that may have opened the door for the State Department’s settlement. Beginning in 2009, the Obama administration launched an overhaul of export control in order to refine regulations for items that were subject to both the State Department’s International Traffic in Arms Regulations and the Commerce Department’s Export Administration Regulations. The goal of the reform was to streamline export controls by transferring commercially available items — such as consumer guns — off the USML and onto the less restrictive Commerce Control List. The State Department began reviewing the munitions list, sifting through each category and removing items that were not considered military-sensitive. By 2016, it had finished reviewing all but three categories: firearms, ammunition and artillery. However, reform of those final categories stalled before it could become policy. A proposed rule would have handed jurisdiction of commercial firearms export controls to the Commerce Department in 2012, but it was delayed following the Sandy Hook school shooting. That proposed rule did not regain momentum until 2018, under Trump. On May 24, the Departments of State and Commerce simultaneously published proposals in the Federal Register to amend the final three categories of the munitions list. The proposed revisions would keep military-grade weapons under State Department jurisdiction and place commercially available firearms under the purview or the Commerce Department. According to the New York Times, these proposals strongly resemble the Obama administration’s 2012 version. CNN reported that the government is currently reviewing them. This may explain the State Department’s sudden decision to settle its case with Wilson. By recommending that commercial firearm exports move under Commerce Department oversight, the May 24 proposals would likely free Wilson’s blueprints from the International Traffic in Arms Regulations that previously restricted them. ""My guess is that it was somehow wrapped up in the movement of items from the (U.S. Munitions List) to the (Commerce Control List),"" said Rachel Stohl, managing director at the Stimson Center and an expert in the international arms trade. ""If you deregulate the weapons themselves, it would follow that the technical specs could be deregulated as well."" Stohl added that the settlement was ""unexpected"" and ""the State and Commerce Departments have been less than forthcoming on these details."" For his part, Wilson has agreed to refrain from posting his blueprints for at least another month while the multi-state lawsuit travels through the courts. A headline suggested that the government settlement that would have made 3D-printable guns available for download was actually a Trump administration decision, and that Trump said that didn't ""make much sense."" We could not independently determine the extent of Trump’s involvement, although Sanders said the president was not afforded the opportunity to approve of the settlement decision. But the State Department under Trump did initiate the settlement after previously taking steps to clear a path for it. However, the Obama administration’s export control reform made those steps possible, and it is not far-fetched to consider the Trump administration’s move a continuation of that initiative",Mostly True,"August 2, 2018"
"Says Pete Gallego canceled a ""planned meeting with the families of Sandy Hook victims.""","In a fundraising appeal, San Antonio state Rep. Roland Gutierrez portrayed fellow Democrat Pete Gallego of Alpine as a ""career politician"" whose ""cozy relationship"" with the National Rifle Association prompted him to scrap a meeting with the parents of Sandy Hook children. As a U.S. House member, we confirmed, Gallego fielded a donation from the NRA, which graded his record highly. But he also met with the parents concerned about gun issues though not at the originally scheduled time, interviews and photos show. Gutierrez and Gallego, who won a term in Congress after spending more than 20 years in the Texas House, appear to be the highest-profile hopefuls among eight contenders to serve out more than two years left in convicted felon Carlos Uresti’s term representing Texas Senate District 19, which sprawls southwest from San Antonio to the border and west past Alpine and Pecos. The election is July 31, 2018. Gutierrez declared in a July 18, 2018, campaign email blast that Gallego ""in a moment of political cowardice, cancelled a planned meeting with the families of Sandy Hook victims,"" referring to the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., that left 20 children and six staff members dead. The Dec. 14, 2012, massacre occurred 20 days before Gallego began what proved to be one term representing Texas’ 23rd Congressional District. But a group of victims’ family members met with individual lawmakers in June 2013, about six months into Gallego’s term. So, did Gallego cancel his meeting with shooting victims’ families? Postponed by hours? A web link in Gutierrez’s email led us to a June 15, 2013, Huffington Post news article recapping efforts by victims’ families and friends to seek a change in law requiring background checks for all gun purchases. Federal law requires such checks for purchases from licensed gun dealers but not in private transactions including gun shows. The Post story indeed says Gallego canceled his meeting with Newtown Action Alliance, a group that describes itself as a ""Newtown-based, national grassroots organization"" whose mission is to ""achieve the steady and continuous reduction of gun violence through legislative and cultural changes."" Also, the story says, Gallego’s office did not immediately respond to the Post’s request for comment. But hold on: An update affixed at the end of the story quotes Erin Nikitchyuk, a mother whose son survived the rampage, saying that Gallego rescheduled and then held his meeting with the group, during which he was ""conscientious"" and ""welcoming,"" Nikitchyuk was quoted saying. For our part, we asked Nikitchyuk about the described meeting through Facebook messages. She replied: ""I absolutely remember meeting with him. In fact, his is the most memorable meeting I had."" Nikitchyuk subsequently messaged us the group’s itinerary from its trip to Washington, D.C., June 12 and 13, 2013 and showing that family members initially expected to meet Gallego at 9:45 a.m. on Thursday, June 13. Nikitchyuk also connected us with another Alliance member, Kari Hulgaard, who posted to Facebook photos of Gallego in the Alliance-coordinated meeting:     Photos courtesy of Kari Hulgaard’s Facebook page (album titled ""2013 June Newtown Action Alliance"") Hulgaard posted the photos on Facebook June 14, 2013 and made the photos viewable to anyone after we made our inquiries. By text, she told us she wasn’t sure if the meeting took place that day or simply later than the originally scheduled  9:45 a.m. June 13. Hulgaard wrote: ""Our group was able to spend a generous amount of time with Gallego. He was most endearing and helpful in gaining perspective about how politics work in Texas when it comes to gun violence and gun laws."" Nikitchyuk separately told us that among the meeting attendees were ""the brother of one teacher who lost her life and at least one survivor sibling."" Gallego, asked for his account, said by phone that the meeting singled out by Gutierrez wasn’t canceled; it was slightly postponed, he said. Gallego said he ultimately met with ""eight to 10"" members of the Alliance for ""an hour, hour and a half,"" he estimated. Gallego on changes to gun laws So, did Gallego commit, after meeting family members, to supporting universal gun-purchase background checks? He did not, according to the Post story, which quotes Nikitchyuk saying, ""we clearly do not have his vote on supporting background checks at this time."" In 2018, she told us by phone that alliance members asked Gallego ""where he stands."" According to Nikitchyuk, Gallego responded, ""Do you want to know where I stand or how I’ll vote? Because they’re not necessarily the same thing."" He went on to tell the Alliance they ""would need to change the hearts and minds of his constituents,"" Nikitchyuk said. By phone, Gallego said he didn’t remember saying he wouldn’t support a bill mandating universal background checks, but did recall talking to the group about restoring a federal assault weapons ban. Nonetheless, Gallego said by text that he now believes ""if you’re buying a weapon--whether at a store or at a gun show or through most private transactions, you should pass a background check."" We alerted Colin Strother, a political consultant to Gutierrez, of the indications that Gallego met with the alliance members; Strother stood by Gutierrez’s claim that Gallego had canceled such a meeting. By phone, Strother also noted that Gallego in Congress had an A-level rating from the National Rifle Association, which donated $1,000 to Gallego’s congressional campaign in 2014, federal filings show. Strother also told us Gutierrez supports universal background checks and a federal ban on assault weapons. Our ruling Gutierrez said Gallego as a U.S. House member ""canceled a planned meeting with the families of Sandy Hook victims."" This claim proved factually incomplete.

"""If there is a firearm available, it is 17 times more likely to be used either for suicide or for assaulting a friend, relative, an acquaintance than it is to be used in fending off an intruder.""","The most recent mass shooting, which killed five Capital Gazette newspaper employees in Annapolis, Md., reignited the gun control debate. The tragedy brought to mind a claim made earlier this year by Democratic gubernatorial candidate and Madison Mayor Paul Soglin. During a March 23, 2018, news conference, Soglin claimed: ""The latest statistics demonstrated that if there is a firearm available, it is 17 times more likely to be used either for suicide or for assaulting a friend, relative, an acquaintance than it is to be used in fending off an intruder."" In light of recent events, we decided to examine Soglin’s claim. Guns and the risk of suicide, assault When asked to backup the claim, Soglin pointed to a January 2016 article in The Trace, a nonprofit news organization focused on gun issues, titled ""A gun as a defense against terrorists? The stats say it’s more likely to harm your family."" The article cites a statistic we came across frequently during our research -- household gun ownership triples the risk of suicide and doubles the risk of homicide. In addition, the article highlighted a study that found access to firearms increases the likelihood of assaults against family members and others to whom people are close, such as girlfriends or boyfriends, escalating to homicide. That 1992 study led by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found death was 12 times more likely if such assaults involved a firearm than if the assault did not involve a firearm. However, neither the study nor the article states that guns are 17 times more likely to be used for suicide or assault than they are for self defense. So, where did the number come from? Well, if Soglin added all of the numbers — three times the risk for suicide, two times the risk for homicide and 12 times more likely for a family and intimate assault to escalate to homicide — he would have gotten 17. But the numbers cannot be added together -- family and intimate assaults that escalate to homicide are already accounted for under homicides as whole. In addition, none of these numbers compare the use of a gun for self-defense with the risk of homicide or suicide, which was the focus of Soglin’s claim. The studies compare the risk of gun ownership to non ownership. Are there other studies that are on point? According to a 2014 analysis in the Annals of Medicine that examined 16 published studies, people in the United States with access to a firearm are three times more likely to die by suicide than those who do not have access, and are two times more likely to die by homicide. This study made no mention of family or intimate assaults, and did not make comparisons with self defense. We could not find any recent studies comparing how often guns are used for suicide and assault vs. how often they are used for self defense, but there is a 20-year-old study that comes close to corroborating Soglin’s claim. That 1998 study by A.L. Kellermann with the Emory University Center for Injury Control said for every time a gun is used in the home for self-defense or legally justifiable shootings, it is used four times in an unintentional shooting, seven times in a criminal assault or homicide and 11 times in an attempted or completed suicide. The study found a gun is 18 times more likely to be used in an attempted or completed suicide, homicide or assault than it is for self-defense. But some of these homicides may involve strangers and, therefore, it would not be entirely accurate to say this study supports Soglin’s claim about the danger to known victims. What’s more, gun laws, ownership and crime rates have changed since this study was completed, so its findings may be out of date. Finally, Soglin’s larger point about guns being used infrequently for self defense is generally accurate. A study done using federal crime and victimization statistics by the Violence Policy Center, a Washington, D.C.-based organization dedicated to stopping gun deaths and injuries, found that between 2007 and 2011, there were 29.6 million victims of an attempted or completed violent crime. Of those victims, 235,700 used a firearm as a form of self defense. That means about 0.8 percent of attempted or completed violent crimes involved a victim using a firearm as a form of self-defense. Our rating Soglin claimed ""If there is a firearm available, it is 17 times more likely to be used either for suicide or for assaulting a friend, relative, an acquaintance than it is to be used in fending off an intruder."" Soglin is on point in stating a gun is much more likely to be used for a suicide, assault or homicide than used in self-defense, but is on less solid ground when it comes to stating exactly how many times more likely. That depends on the study, many of which do not differentiate between known and unknown victims. What’s more, recent research is limited",Half True,"July 12, 2018"
"On assault weapons, Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh’s position is ""way out of the judicial mainstream, far to the right of even late Justice Scalia.""","Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., a vocal advocate of tighter gun laws, called out President Donald Trump’s pick for the Supreme Court for the nominee’s position on the Second Amendment. ""Brett Kavanaugh is a true Second Amendment radical,"" Murphy tweeted July 9. ""He believes assault weapon bans are unconstitutional, a position way out of the judicial mainstream, far to the right of even late Justice Scalia."" Brett Kavanaugh is a true Second Amendment radical. He believes assault weapon bans are unconstitutional, a position way out of the judicial mainstream, far to the right of even late Justice Scalia. We wondered whether Kavanaugh, who will replace Justice Anthony M. Kennedy if confirmed, on the issue of assault weapons indeed stands to the right of Scalia, who as a young man would tote his rifle on the New York City subway. After reading the relevant court decisions, experts told us both Kavanaugh and Scalia hold that assault weapons are protected under the Second Amendment. Assault weapons encompass a series of semi-automatic firearms, mostly rifles. Semi-automatic weapons are those where one trigger pulled equals one bullet shot. One of the defining cases on gun rights in recent years is D.C. vs. Heller. Alongside five others, Richard Heller, a special police officer for the District of Columbia, filed a lawsuit in 2003 challenging the constitutionality of the Firearms Control Regulations Act of 1975, which restricted D.C. residents from owning handguns. The suit eventually reached the Supreme Court, which ruled 5-4 in Heller’s favor. The majority decision was written by Scalia. Scalia argued that handguns have not traditionally been banned and are in common use. He also pointed out, however, that the right granted by the Second Amendment ""is not unlimited,"" and upholds ""laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms."" The question of assault weapons never came up. Instead, rifles came up in a later legal challenge between Heller and Washington, when Heller questioned the constitutionality of the district’s Firearms Registration Amendment Act of 2008, created in response to the Supreme Court decision. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit favored the district two to one, but Kavanaugh dissented. ""There is no meaningful or persuasive constitutional distinction between semi-automatic handguns and semi-automatic rifles,"" Kavanaugh wrote. ""Semi-automatic rifles, like semi-automatic handguns, have not traditionally been banned and are in common use by law-abiding citizens for self-defense in the home, hunting, and other lawful uses."" When the question of whether assault weapons bans are unconstitutional was raised of the Supreme Court, Scalia was unable to answer because the court rejected the case. The case in question was Friedman vs. Highland Park, a challenge to a Chicago suburb’s ordinance banning semi-automatic assault weapons and large-capacity magazines. However, Justice Clarence Thomas voiced a similar opinion to Kavanaugh’s in the rejection, which Scalia joined. Scalia and Thomas wrote that in accepting the ban, the court was not complying with the precedent set by Heller. ""The city’s ban is thus highly suspect because it broadly prohibits common semi-automatic firearms used for lawful purposes,"" Thomas wrote. ""Roughly five million Americans own AR-style semi-automatic rifles. The overwhelming majority of citizens who own and use such rifles do so for lawful purposes, including self-defense and target shooting. Under our precedents, that is all that is needed for citizens to have a right under the Second Amendment to keep such weapons."" ""In the Highland Park case, we should say Kavanaugh was on the same page as Scalia,"" said Eugene Volokh, a constitutional law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. Murphy’s office pointed out that Scalia’s opinion explicitly allowed for regulations, which some lower courts found included assault weapons bans. But the rulings are not unanimous. ""You have more courts upholding the bans than finding them unconstitutional, but there’s definitely a split of opinion on this,"" said David Kopel, an associate policy analyst at the Independence Institute. Murphy said that on assault weapons, Kavanaugh’s position is ""way out of the judicial mainstream, far to the right of even late Justice Scalia."" Kavanaugh stated that assault weapons bans were unconstitutional in the circuit court case Heller vs. District of Columbia. Scalia’s opinion on the Supreme Court allowed for some regulations in District of Columbia vs. Heller, which some courts have interpreted to rule in favor of assault weapons bans. But the decision was not about assault weapons. We found at least one instance where Scalia signed off on saying an assault weapons ban would be unconstitutional. So Kavanaugh’s position and Scalia’s are substantially similar",Mostly False,"July 11, 2018"
"""US representatives promise implement of UN gun-control plans""","A conservative website falsely claimed that U.S. representatives to the United Nations promised to push for gun-control policies at home. ""US representatives promise implement of UN gun-control plans,"" said a July 5, 2018, headline from the Conservative Daily Post website. The report cited a similar story from the New American, a bimonthly magazine for ""freedom-loving Americans"" who support ""limited government under the Constitution,"" according to its about page. Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook’s News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) This is not the first time we have encountered falsehoods concerning the U.N. and gun control. We previously looked at the claim that a U.N. treaty would mandate a ""new international gun registry"" and a chain email that wrongly accused the Obama administration of planning to use international treaties to ban all weapons. As with these past statements, there is also a lot wrong with this new report about the U.N. conference. The report said U.S. representatives attending the Third Review Conference for the June 2018 U.N. Program of Action on Small Arms and Light Weapons agreed ""to begin developing ‘legal frameworks’ … that will enforce ‘proper management’ of ‘small arms and light weapons’ stockpiles."" The report went on to say, misleadingly, that the United States pledged to help the U.N. track and confiscate firearms, including stockpiles owned by private citizens. ""In other words, the United States government is expected to help push an absurdly anti-Second Amendment set of demands on the American people,"" the story said. ""If they don’t push that set of rules upon the people swiftly enough, then the U.N. will decide if it wants to send armed peacekeepers to the nation or not. This agreement is wildly unconstitutional."" Citing six points spelled out in the ""implementation at the national level"" section of the conference’s outcome document, the story said the meeting resulted in the United States’ willing violation of Second and Tenth Amendment rights. But the story erred in its understanding of the conference. In reality, the conference provided an opportunity for participating countries to review their progress and reaffirm a commitment made in 2001 to limit the illicit trade of small arms and light weapons. According to the website for the U.N. Office of Disarmament Affairs, the original meeting in 2001 saw governments agree ""to improve national small arms laws, import/export controls, and stockpile management — and to engage in cooperation and assistance."" Nikki Haley, the U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., attended this year's conference along with several advisers, according to the U.N.'s list of participants. The State Department and the U.N. Office for Disarmament Affairs did not respond to requests for comment on the role of U.S. representatives at the conference. Caroline Dorminey, a policy analyst with the Cato Institute and an expert with the Forum on the Arms Trade, explained that the U.N. program focuses on the illegal flow of small arms and light weapons, meaning any subsequent measures enacted by the United States would not violate Second or Tenth Amendment rights. ""The purpose of the Third Review Conference is to make progress on stopping the illicit trade of small arms and light weapons,"" Dorminey wrote in an email. ""The trade being targeted in particular is dispersion/diversion — especially across borders — that fuels black markets and conflict in unstable regions."" ""Any measures enacted by the UN program would not infringe on Second or Tenth Amendment rights because they are inherently focused on illicit trade — not the legal trade within American borders that those amendments provide the basis for."" Conservative Daily Post did not respond to a request for comment submitted via its contact page. A headline stated, ""US representatives promise implement of UN gun-control plans."" The story said U.S. representatives at a U.N. conference pledged to adopt new gun-control measures that would threaten Second and Tenth Amendment rights. U.S. representatives at the conference did reaffirm the nation’s agreement in 2001 to work toward limiting the illicit international trade of small arms and light weapons. But the United States’ continued participation in such an agreement should have no effect on its citizens’ constitutional rights, given the focus on illegal actions in global trade",Mostly False,"July 10, 2018"
"Says the ""Pope calls for world wide gun confiscation except for the UN""","The Common Sense Show, an online program with the tagline ""Freeing America one enslaved mind at a time,"" took Pope Francis to task for his stance on weapons. ""The Pope has said we need to take away all guns -- total gun confiscation across the planet "" show host Dave Hodges said May 3, 2018. ""But he does say the U.N. should be the only group that has guns."" Facebook users flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. Read more about our partnership with Facebook. We reached out to Hodges through his website to learn the source behind his statement. We didn’t hear back. We searched the Nexis database of news reports and did not find anything that backed up this claim, but it’s possible that he’s conflated a couple of speeches from the pope. Pope Francis spoke to the General Assembly of the United Nations in September 2015. There, he called for a world free of nuclear weapons, and an end to ""violence against ethnic and religious minorities."" Speaking of the Middle East and Africa, he decried the situations where innocent people ""have been forced to witness the destruction of their places of worship, their cultural and religious heritage, their houses and property, and have faced the alternative either of fleeing or of paying for their adhesion to good and to peace by their own lives, or by enslavement."" In that speech, Francis spoke of ""the negative effects of military and political interventions which are not coordinated between members of the international community."" If that’s the source of Hodges’ statement, it doesn’t match what he described. There’s no call for universal collection of guns, nor did he specify that the United Nations would be the only group that can coordinate military interventions. In fact, when the pope visited Central African Republic, his call for peace between warring Christian and Muslim factions acknowledged there is an appropriate role for arms. ""To all those who unjustly use weapons in this world, I appeal: Put down your weapons of death; arm yourselves instead with justice, love, mercy and authentic guarantees of peace,"" he said August 2015. Pope Francis opposed the unjust use of weapons, meaning in his eyes, there can be a just use of weapons. In his 2015 speech to the U.S. Congress, Francis also called for an end to the international arms trade. Hodges might have also reworked fake news that twisted remarks the pope made three years ago in Turin, Italy, in 2015, when he was at a rally of thousands of young people. The pope was talking about war, trust and politics. And he singled out the weapons industry. ""People, managers, businessmen who call themselves Christian and they manufacture weapons, that leads to a bit of distrust, doesn’t it?"" he said, as reported by Reuters. In the minds of some, that translated into the pope saying that gun owners can’t be Christians",False Pants on Fire,"June 20, 2018"
"""It’s against the law in Texas to let any loaded gun get in the hands of a child.""","Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick told a national TV audience after the May 2018 Santa Fe High School shootings that he doesn’t see a need for more gun regulation in that Texas already bars children from having loaded weapons. We decided to check Patrick's reference to law given that the admitted Santa Fe shooter reportedly used his father’s shotgun and handgun in the attack. Our research identified the 1995 law, though we also learned it wouldn’t apply to the Santa Fe incident due to the shooter’s age of 17. Patrick, taking questions from George Stephanopoulos on the May 20, 2017, edition of ABC's This Week, said: ""We have to look at ourselves, George. It’s not about the guns. It’s about us. Can there be gun regulation? ""Gun control, I believe, starts at home, George. Every person who owns a gun must be accountable for their guns at home,"" Patrick said. ""We don’t know all the facts yet. But this particular young man got his guns in some way from his parents’ home. You should have your guns locked up. It’s against the law in Texas to let any loaded gun get in the hands of a child, for example."" Law confirmed Our online search for such a law led us to a web page about preventing Texas children from getting guns created by the San Francisco-based Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. That page says Texas has a law holding a person criminally liable if he or she, ""with criminal negligence,"" fails to secure a ""readily dischargeable"" firearm and a child under age 17 gains access to it. Next, we turned to section 46.13 of the Texas penal code, titled ""Making a Firearm Accessible to a Child,"" which defines a readily dischargeable firearm as one ""loaded with ammunition, whether or not a round is in the chamber."" The law states:   ""A person commits an offense if a child gains access to a readily dischargeable firearm and the person with criminal negligence: (1)  failed to secure the firearm;  or (2)  left the firearm in a place to which the person knew or should have known the child would gain access."" Under the law, ""secure"" means ""to take steps that a reasonable person would take to prevent the access to a readily dischargeable firearm by a child, including but not limited to placing a firearm in a locked container or temporarily rendering the firearm inoperable by a trigger lock or other means."" The law otherwise provides defenses to prosecution starting with whether the child’s access was supervised by a person older than 18 and the firearm was for hunting, sporting ""or other lawful purposes."" Under the law, a violation is a Class C misdemeanor or a Class A misdemeanor ""if the child discharges the firearm and causes death or serious bodily injury to himself or another person."" Legislative history Legislative records show the legislation creating the law won approval in 1995, the same year that then-state Sen. Jerry Patterson, R-Pasadena, shepherded into law the state's concealed-carry measure. We connected with Patterson, who told us by email that the child-specific proposal, initiated by Rep. Al Edwards, D-Houston, had momentum that year in part due to testimony by a Houston couple who had lost their son to an accidental shooting. The boy’s mother, Linda Tarr, testified at the time: ""This bill is to save children. It  is not a gun-control bill. This is a gun-responsibility act, and children are our responsibility.'' Effective law? We also wondered about the law’s effects. The April 1995 Austin American-Statesman news story where we spotted Tarr’s testimony said that in 1993, 42 children younger than 17 had been killed in accidents involving firearms. There have lately been fewer such deaths, according to figures we requested from the Texas Department of State Health Services. Spokesman Chris Van Deusen emailed us a chart indicating that in 2014-15, 11 Texas children younger than 17 were killed in accidents involving firearms. Separately, Ari Freilich, a lawyer for the Giffords center, said by email that Texas is among 27 states with child access prevention laws potentially making adults legally accountable for letting minors gain unsupervised access to guns. But Freilich called the Texas law weaker than laws in some states because it only applies to adults who leave readily operable loaded firearms accessible to unsupervised minors. ""As a result, Texas' law would likely not apply even if an adult left an unsupervised minor home alone with an unloaded firearm out on the table right next to a box of ammunition,"" Freilich wrote. Also, Freilich said, the Texas law wouldn't apply to what evidently happened at Santa Fe High School because the admitted shooter was 17--and the law applies only to guns taken by minors 16 or younger. After the Santa Fe shootings, the center posted a memo to Texas Gov. Greg Abbott stating the law should be amended, at the least, to apply to minors under 18 ""and to cases where an adult leaves unloaded firearms and ammunition accessible to the minor."" We also asked the NRA-tied Texas State Rifle Association about the law. By phone, Alice Gene Tripp praised it, saying: ""It doesn’t try to criminalize how you store your guns. It simply puts a penalty in statute if you don’t do it effectively. Texas allows adults to make adult decisions and penalizes those who don’t do it correctly."" Our ruling Patrick said: ""It’s against the law in Texas to let any loaded gun get in the hands of a child."" A 1995 state law makes it a misdemeanor if a person with criminal negligence fails to secure a loaded gun and a child younger than 17 accesses it or if a person leaves the gun where he or she knew or should have known the child would get it",True,"May 30, 2018"
"""Trained police hit their targets less than 30 percent of the time.""","Calls to arm school teachers grew louder after a gunman at a Santa Fe, Texas, high school on May 18 killed eight students and two teachers, and injured 13 others. Second Amendment proponents, with backing from President Donald Trump, say putting guns in the hands of volunteer personnel would make schools safer. But gun control advocates argue the proposal would lead to dangerous unintended consequences. ""Trained police hit their targets less than 30 percent of the time, yet the @NRA wants to arm volunteer teachers,"" Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action, tweeted May 21. ""It's on each of us to prevent this NRA dystopia, and stop letting the gun lobby write our gun laws. We're sacrificing our children at the altar of gun manufacturers' profits.""  Trained police hit their targets less than 30% of the time, yet the @NRA wants to arm volunteer teachers. It's on each of us to prevent this NRA dystopia, and stop letting the gun lobby write our gun laws. We're sacrificing our children at the altar of gun manufacturers' profits. https://t.co/mWCBVrrLNH Watts may have a point that the average armed teacher might be less accurate than a trained cop. But her claim that trained police hit their target ""less than 30 percent of the time"" is not as clear-cut as Watts suggests. For starters, national numbers on police marksmanship are not readily available. But we found data on some individual jurisdictions, including several major metropolitan police departments. An aide to Watts pointed us to a 2008 Rand study that looked at the accuracy of New York Police Department officer-involved shootings. The key data point is the ""hit rate,"" the number of rounds that struck a suspect divided by total shots fired. The Rand study looked at NYPD firearm-discharge reports from from 1998 through 2006. Some of the findings point in Watts’ favor, while other data refutes her point. Hit ratios were below 30 percent for gunfights (18 percent) and from long ranges (23 percent from more than seven yards away). However, in cases where suspects did not return fire, NYPD officers hit their targets 30 percent of the time. Accuracy levels were above 30 percent when the target was seven yards away or closer (37 percent).  Recent data shows a further uptick in the NYPD’s hit rate compared with the Rand study. Inspector Kevin Maloney, who headed up the NYPD unit that oversees police-involved shootings, told the New York Daily News in December 2017 that the NYPD fired a record low number of rounds that year. The department’s hit ratio also exceeded those in the 2008 Rand study in 2017. NYPD cops fired 170 shots and hit their targets 75 times, for a hit ratio of 44 percent for the year, as of Dec. 21, 2017. In 2016, police landed 107 of a total 304 shots fired, a hit ratio of roughly 35 percent. Again, Watts said the hit rate was less than 30 percent. Recent data from the Los Angeles Police Department further undermines Watts’ claim. According to the LAPD’s 2016 report, the average annual hit ratio from 2012 through 2016 was 33.4 percent, with a substantial uptick in 2016.  ""With a lot of training and reform, LAPD has a hit rate of 48 percent (in 2016). That is likely at the high end of hit rates,"" said Gregory Ridgeway, an associate professor of criminology and statistics at the University of Pennsylvania. ""Their number of rounds per incident is also way down in the last five years."" In a 2006 study, Michael D. White, a criminology professor at Arizona State University, provided a roundup of hit ratio data from various jurisdictions and timeframes. (This data is quite old but we provide to give a broader cross-section of jurisdictions.) JURISDICTION HIT RATIO TIMEFRAME 155 Michigan police departments 27% 1976 to 1981 New York Police Department 26% 1987 New York Police Department 31% 1988 New York Police Department 23% 1990 Los Angeles Police Department 56% 1970s Los Angeles Police Department 28% 1980 to 1988 Metro-Dade, Florida 31% January 1984 - June 1988 Memphis 25% 1991 San Antonio 100% 1991 San Francisco 100% 1991 ""Hit rates vary notably across police agencies but rarely exceed 50 percent,"" White wrote. ""The research examining shooter accuracy overwhelmingly debunks the Hollywood myth of police officers as sharp shooters who can wing suspects in the shoulder or leg or shoot weapons out of suspects’ hands."" Firearms training varies across jurisdictions. Some major metropolitan police departments require officers to qualify up to four times a year on handgun marksmanship and undergo simulated training exercises. Police experts say that armed teachers should also be forced to undertake specialized and repeated training regimens. ""Simply putting a gun on the premises and hoping someone’s going to do the right thing with it is baseless,"" Chris Grollnek, a former law enforcement officer who specializes in security issues told the PBS Newshour. ""All you’re doing is signing people up for PTSD."" Trump first proposed arming teachers following the Feb. 14 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., that killed 14 students and three staff members, and wounded 17 others. Administration officials in March said the White House wants to partner with local official to give teachers and other volunteer school personnel ""rigorous firearms training,"" but offered few details on a concept that has been embraced by the National Rifle Association. Neither the White House nor NRA responded to requests for a comment. Watts said, ""Trained police hit their targets less than 30 percent of the time."" By saying less than 30 percent, Watts is distorting the facts. A national figure for police marksmanship is not readily available.  Overall, data from some jurisdictions supports Watts’ claim, while other data refutes it.

"A recent spending bill had at least ""$1.6 billion in there ... for schools to give them an opportunity to secure them.""","It isn’t often that President Donald Trump and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., use a similar talking point. But it happened recently with regard to funding for school safety — and neither Trump nor Pelosi was accurate. In remarks to the National Rifle Association on May 4, Trump said, ""I recently signed legislation that includes more than $2 billion to improve school safety, including the funding for training, and metal detectors, and security and mental health."" Two weeks later, Vice President Mike Pence repeated that $2 billion figure in a speech in Indianapolis. Our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker awarded these comments Four Pinocchios, their worst rating. Pelosi, however, used much the same logic during a CNN town hall on May 23. She touted new funding for school security, using a somewhat smaller figure of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion. Here’s the exchange with host Chris Cuomo: Cuomo: ""The building we're in now, the building that you work in, the point of entry there is secure. You don't walk in with a trench coat with a shotgun underneath your jacket and get in. It doesn't happen. You know this. Why can't that be part of the equation? Talk about universal background checks, fine. Talk about mental health, how to identify them. The money for treatment. But why either/or? Why not make the schools safer? I know it's a state issue, but they're going to ask for money…"" Pelosi: ""It is a state issue."" Cuomo: ""And that's where the federal government comes in. … You could offer them money to make schools so that when you go there as a guest, and you walk in, of course, they'll have multiple points of egress for emergencies. But you're going to be looked at when you go in that school and you're not going to walk in with a gun under your coat."" Pelosi: ""In our omnibus bill that we passed just a few weeks ago, we had $1.8 billion — I think it was $1.8 billion, it could be $1.6 billion — in there for this purpose, for schools to make — to give them an opportunity to secure them. And those schools have to make those decisions."" So, did a recent spending bill include at least $1.6 billion for school security or safety? No. When we checked with Pelosi’s office, they said she was referring to the Student Support and Academic Enrichment grants program, known as SSAE for short. This program, run by the Education Department, has been authorized to spend up to $1.6 billion. However, both the dollar figure and the nature of the grants don’t hold up to scrutiny. First, while the program has been authorized to spend up to $1.6 billion, the most recent spending bill only provided a portion of that amount, $1.1 billion. Pelosi ""misspoke on the specific amount,"" said spokesman Drew Hammill. It’s important to remember that Cuomo’s question focused on what could be done to boost security against armed school attacks. The SSAE program, it turns out, isn’t geared exclusively toward school security. Rather, it’s focused broadly on providing ""all students with access to a well-rounded education,"" improving ""school conditions for student learning,"" and improving ""the use of technology in order to improve the academic achievement and digital literacy of all students."" School violence is one of the specific areas cited in the law. The grants may also be used for improving school-based mental health services, which can ease the causes of some school-violence incidents. However, these are just two of the areas these grants can be used for. Some of the others are: • Technologies such as software, simulations, online databases, computer-based assessments, and educational access tools for rural areas. • The prevention, early intervention, rehabilitation referral, recovery support services, or education related to the illegal use of drugs. • Schools, or dedicated programs within schools, to engage students in ""rigorous, relevant, and integrated learning experiences focused on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), including computer science."" The explanation of the spending bill published in the Congressional Record on March 28 emphasized that SSAE grants ""can be utilized for a wide range of uses."" While the uses mentioned in the explanation included ""school-based violence prevention strategies,"" the explanation emphasized that the bill ""encourages the department to especially support pre-kindergarten through grade 12 computer science education programs that address the enrollment and achievement gap for underrepresented students such as minorities, girls, and youth from families living at or below the poverty line."" And a House committee report describing the bill highlighted that ""programs designed to support non-cognitive factors such as critical thinking skills, social skills, work ethic, problem solving, and community responsibility are an eligible use of funds under SSAE grants supporting a well-rounded education."" So the $1.1 billion in the spending bill won’t necessarily be spent on school security of the type Cuomo was asking about. Ultimately, ""school safety has to compete with STEM, foreign language learning, technology enhancements and numerous other educational priorities for those SSAE funds,"" said Bob Farrace, the director of public affairs for the National Association of Secondary School Principals. ""With that single funding pool, school leaders have to balance the need to safeguard the school with the need to make the school a place worth coming to."" Pelosi’s spokesman, Hammill, emphasized that protecting students from attacks is about more than just hardening infrastructure. The grants, he said, promote "" ‘soft’ efforts to ensure schools can combat bullying, harassment, while offering school personnel training, mental health resources, comprehensive school mental and behavioral health services, drug and violence prevention, training on trauma-informed practices, and health and physical education."" While those areas are covered as acceptable uses, the expressed desire by Congress is that these grants also foster such goals as boosting STEM education, digital learning and distance education — and that suggests that not all $1.1 billion will be used on efforts that address school violence, even indirectly. Responding to a question about preventing gun violence in schools, Pelosi said that a recent spending bill had at least ""$1.6 billion in there ... for schools to give them an opportunity to secure them."" Her office acknowledged to PolitiFact that she should have said $1.1 billion, the amount devoted to a federal grant program for schools that was funded in the bill. Still, even that figure is likely exaggerated. When the Education Department distributes $1.1 billion in grants under the program she was referencing, school security will have to fight for that money against such items as STEM education and digital education",Mostly False,"May 24, 2018"
"Perpetrators of school shootings ""have been drugged in many cases … many of these young boys have been on Ritalin since they were in kindergarten.""","The National Rifle Association’s new president, Oliver North, deflected attention off guns and onto medication in the wake of the latest school shooting. ""The problem that we got is we are trying like the dickens to treat the symptom without treating the disease,"" North said. ""The disease in this case isn't the Second Amendment. The disease is youngsters who are steeped in a culture of violence. ""They have been drugged in many cases. Nearly all of these perpetrators are male and they are young teenagers in most cases. And they have come through a culture where violence is commonplace. All you need to do is turn on the TV, go to a movie,"" North continued. ""If you look at what has happened to the young people, many of these young boys have been on Ritalin since they were in kindergarten."" Pundits have long harped on the dangers of violence in movies, television shows and video games. But we were curious about the link North suggests between Ritalin, prescribed for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, and gun violence. The overprescription of ADHD medication has been the subject of heavy debate. For the record, we found no evidence that the suspected Texas shooter was diagnosed with ADHD, or prescribed Ritalin. More broadly and to North’s point, we found no evidence to back up the idea that ADHD medication was behind school shootings or that ""many"" shooters had been on Ritalin. ""The short answer is that this is nonsense,"" said Katherine S. Newman, Torrey Little professor of sociology at the University of Massachusetts and author of Rampage: The Social Roots of School Shootings. For Rampage, Newman and her fellow researchers studied medication as a precipitating factor in the school shootings that took place between 1970 and 2000. They found no evidence drugs played a role. ""​The vast majority of shooters were, sadly, not under any kind of medical supervision,"" Newman said. ""Indeed, the shocking finding is that despite evidence of serious mental disorders (after the fact at least), these young men had — in the main — not been seen by physicians for any kind of psychological disorder and were hence not under medication at all."" Peter Langman, a psychologist in private practice who has been studying school shootings for over a decade, said he has not found any ties between psychiatric medication and rampage attacks, either. Langman looked at 48 school shooters between 1966 and 2012 in his 2015 book School Shooters: Understanding High School, College, and Adult Perpetrators. Langman found that two of the 24 secondary school shooters he profiled were taking medication at the time of their attacks. A third shooter might have been, or he may have stopped his medication three weeks before the attack. Including that case, 12.5 percent of the shooters Langman studied were taking medication. The 12.5 percent statistic held true for the 48 shooters Langman studied, too, which also included adults and college students. Andrew Arulanandam, a spokesman for the NRA, sent along various stories about the overprescription of Ritalin. Only one was a scientific study mentioning both ADHD medication and violence. The study found that three ADHD drugs were responsible for 108 of 1,937 case reports of violence toward others in a 69-month period FDA database. But Russell Barkley, a clinical professor of psychiatry who monitors ADHD research weekly at the Virginia Treatment Center for Children, explained that the study does not control for the high probability that patients receiving treatment with these drugs were already highly aggressive to begin with. ""We have no research in our scientific literature of more than 50,000 articles showing that Ritalin increases aggression on average,"" Barkley said. ""Research in fact shows that stimulants like Ritalin reduce aggressive behavior in those with ADHD."" There is also no evidence that any of those reports of violence were related to school shootings. ""We don’t know that any of those people in the study had anything to do with a mass rampage attack,"" Langman said. ""Even if the drug gets people to get agitated or angry, there’s a difference between that and plotting and carrying out a mass murder."" North said, ""They have been drugged in many cases … many of these young boys have been on Ritalin since they were in kindergarten."" A minor percentage of school shooters studied had been medicated, not ""many."" The notion that many have specifically been on the drug Ritalin since kindergarten has no factual basis. More broadly, causation has never been established between the medication and violence. We found no specific ties between ADHD medication and school shootings, either",False,"May 22, 2018"
"""So far this year, more students have been killed in schools than soldiers in combat zones.""","  After a student gunman killed 10 people in Santa Fe, Texas, a claim circulated widely on social media that compared the number of deaths in the military with the number of deaths in school shootings. One of the politicians who shared it on social media was Gwen Graham, a former Democratic member of the U.S. House who is now running for governor of Florida. In a May 18 Facebook post, Graham wrote, ""So far this year, more students have been killed in schools than soldiers in combat zones. We are WAY past the point of talking. We need action now."" Graham’s post linked to an article by Philip Bump of the Washington Post titled ""2018 has been deadlier for schoolchildren than service members."" The article found that ""more people have been killed at schools this year than have been killed while serving in the military."" We wanted to look at the data ourselves. Graham’s formulation was a bit narrower than the newspaper’s: Her  post said ""students"" rather than individuals ""at schools,"" and ""in combat zones"" rather than ""while serving in the military."" Either of the definitions is plausible; as it happens, Graham’s parameters make an even stronger case than the Post article does. We found five shooting incidents that resulted in student fatalities in 2018. The figures below do not include adults slain in these incidents, because they are outside the scope of Graham’s statement. Benton, Ky., Jan. 23, 2018: 2 students killed Parkland, Fla., Feb. 14, 2018: 14 students killed Birmingham, Ala., March 7, 2018: 1 student killed Great Mills, Md., March 20, 2018: 1 student killed Santa Fe, Texas, May 18, 2018: 8 students killed Total: 26 students killed in school shootings through May 18, 2018. (Including the adults killed would raise the count to 31 total fatalities.) There are two active combat operations for the U.S. military: Operation Inherent Resolve, which includes anti-ISIS efforts in Iraq and Syria, and Operation Freedom’s Sentinel, which includes military activities in Afghanistan. In 2018, there have been five deadly incidents in Operation Inherent Resolve, on Jan. 8, Feb. 19, March 7, March 15, and March 30. Each of these incidents resulted in one American service member’s death, except for the one on March 15, in which seven airmen died in the crash of an HH-60 Pave Hawk helicopter in western Iraq. So the total number of deaths in 2018 for Operation Inherent Resolve is 11. Meanwhile, there have been two deaths this year in Operation Freedom’s Sentinel. They occurred on Jan. 1 and April 30. Total: 13 service members were killed in combat zones in 2018. That's half the number of student deaths in school shootings this year. The first caveat to consider is that today’s snapshot in time is unusual in recent history. Specifically, the number of school-shooting deaths is unusually high in 2018, according to the Post’s database of school shootings. Through May 18 of 2017, there were two deaths in school shootings. Through May 18 of 2016, it was one; for 2015 it was zero; and for 2014 it was one. Looking at full-year totals, the Post article found that the number of military deaths in 2017 exceeded 30, compared to five school-shooting deaths. The second caveat to know involves the death rate — that is, deaths divided by the total population at risk of death. The death rate remains significantly higher for members of the military in combat zones. There are currently an estimated 50.8 million students enrolled in K-12 classes. That’s vastly larger than the combination of personnel serving in the two military operations cited above, which is less than 20,000 people, according to publicly disclosed data. The Post article that Graham linked to made this point. ""The figures for 2018 do not suggest schools are more dangerous than combat zones,"" the article said. ""So far in 2018, a member of the military has been about 40 times as likely to be killed as someone is to die in a school shooting."" Graham wrote, ""So far this year, more students have been killed in schools than soldiers in combat zones."" On the numbers, she is right. This year at least, within Graham’s stated parameters, exactly twice as many students have died in school shootings than military personnel have died in combat zones. It is important to know, however, the likelihood of being killed in a combat zone is still vastly higher than it is in a school. The statement is accurate but needs additional information",Mostly True,"May 21, 2018"

""People, managers, businessmen who call themselves Christian and they manufacture weapons, that leads to a bit of distrust, doesn’t it?"" he said, as reported by Reuters. Notice that he didn’t mention gun owners. That was the invention of the web article. The pope pulls no punches when he talks about war and arms makers. In his 2015 address to Congress, he urged lawmakers to work to ""end the many armed conflicts throughout our world."" And he added, ""Why are deadly weapons being sold to those who plan to inflict untold suffering on individuals and society? Sadly, the answer, as we all know, is simply for money: money that is drenched in blood, often innocent blood."" The New York Evening News article had the pope talking about gun owners when he wasn’t, and gun makers specifically when he was talking about the arms trade in general. Plus, it made it sound as though he was speaking recently and in the context of the current debate over guns after the shootings in Parkland, Fla., when in reality, his speech was three years old.

He wrote about the deadly outcomes of being fired at by such a weapon. ""Trauma surgeons and coroners will tell you the high-velocity bullet fired from a military-style, semiautomatic assault weapon moves almost three times as fast as a 9mm handgun bullet, delivering far more energy. The bullets create cavities through the victim, wrecking a wider swath of tissue, organs and blood vessels. And a low-recoil weapon with a higher-capacity magazine means more of these deadlier bullets can be fired accurately and quickly without reloading."" Swalwell said that reinstating the federal assault weapons ban that was in effect from 1994 to 2004 would prohibit manufacture and sales, but it would still leave millions of assault weapons on the streets. ""Instead, we should ban possession of military-style semiautomatic assault weapons, we should buy back such weapons from all who choose to abide by the law, and we should criminally prosecute any who choose to defy it by keeping their weapons,"" he wrote. ""The ban would not apply to law enforcement agencies or shooting clubs."" The NaturalNews story said that Swalwell ""actually wants to see door-to-door gun confiscation teams engage in Nazi-style removal tactics in order to rid the streets of all firearms that he personally deems reckless and unnecessary."" We saw no evidence in Swalwell’s op-ed that he wants law enforcement to use such a tactic. We asked his spokeswoman how he would envision law enforcement obtaining such assault weapons. ""The Congressman supports an assault weapon buy-back period, and then limiting any weapons not sold back to licensed clubs and ranges, with a ban on possession anywhere else,"" Caitlyn McNamee said in an email. ""He has never proposed and does not support door-to-door searches, which would be unworkable, unsafe, and – without a warrant – unconstitutional.

"""Breaking: Czech Republic arms citizens. You can now shoot terrorists on sight.""","An article sounding alarm bells about ""Islamic Extremism"" and migrants said that a new law designed to combat terrorism in the Czech Republic allows citizens to carry guns. ""Breaking: Czech Republic arms citizens. You can now shoot terrorists on sight,"" said an April 27 headline on patriotnetwork.one, a website that posts multiple anti-Muslim articles. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. The story celebrated what it described as a new gun policy in the Czech Republic. ""Millions of patriotic men and women are PROUD to stand with the Czech Republic, fearing that if we don’t take action, Islam will soon overtake our nation,"" patriotnetwork.one wrote. While the story said that this is ""breaking"" news, it actually refers to news developments several months ago. In fact, the same story appeared on multiple websites and Facebook in June 2017. While patriotnetwork.one portrayed the law as a done deal, it was only approved by one chamber of the government and so has not actually become law. In 2015, Czech president Milos Zeman called for an international military effort against terrorism and the Islamic State group. Speaking at a Holocaust commemoration forum in Prague, Zeman said such military action would prevent what he called a ""super Holocaust,"" in which hundreds of millions would die. Zeman said in 2016 interview that Czechs should obtain guns to protect themselves against terrorists. ''If it is necessary, people will have to be ready for a situation where they will have to use those guns,'' he said. ''My wife has just got a gun license and has a proper revolver. So I hope she will protect me from terrorists.'' In June 2017, the lower chamber passed an amendment to the constitution related to the carrying of firearms. Kieran Williams, an expert in the politics of Central and Eastern Europe at Drake University, told PolitiFact that the measure would have amended a 1998 act in order to create a constitutional right to keep and bear arms to assist the state against threats to national security. The original act made it a duty to help if called upon by the state. ""Czechs have long had statutory rights to keep and bear arms, and to use force in self-defense,"" he said. ""This constitutional bill was a response to a European Union directive to tighten up possession of certain categories of weapons after the terror attacks in Paris, Brussels and elsewhere; gun advocates hoped to minimize the impact of that directive on the Czech Republic by creating this new constitutional right."" The amendment passed the lower chamber in June. But it was rejected by the Senate in December when it fell short of the needed three-fifths majority. (Our Czech fact-checking friends at demagog.cz pointed us to the Senate vote.) Patriotnetwork.one makes no direct mention of the Senate, although it drew some information from a 2017 Sputniknews article that did mention that the bill still had to be approved by the Senate. The Patriotnetwork.one story is about the Czech Republic, but one of the photos the website used of an angry man appears to be the same as a 2015 photo of a man in a Budapest railway station. The patriotnetwork.one website tries to stir up fear about Muslims, migrants and terrorism in the Czech Republic while ignoring some facts. For starters, the Muslim population in the country of more than 10 million is tiny. The Muslim population was less than 4,000 in the 2011 census, but participants weren’t required to fill out information about their religion. That could be an undercount, but even other estimates aren’t much higher at 22,000. The Czech Republic has taken very few migrants in recent years and ""has no recent history of terrorism and generally has a declining rate of violent crime,"" WIlliams said. Sean Hanley, a senior lecturer at the UCL School of Slavonic and East European Studies in London, said most migrants entering the Czech Republic wanted to access the country to get to other countries such as Germany. There were only 1,525 requests for asylum in the Czech Republic in 2015 and at the peak of the 2014-15 crisis around 1,500 migrants were detained by the Czech authorities for entering the country illegally.  Very small numbers of migrants and refugees entered compared with Hungary or Croatia. ""This is an entirely unrealistic ‘threat’ but it taps into and gives a focus to the fears and insecurities of small, mono-ethnic post-communist country in an uncertain world,"" he said. Hanley said it ""was one of the more bizarre legislative initiatives in the political history of the Czech Republic"" and occurred amid a backdrop of anti-refugee hysteria. Patriotnetwork.one said in a headline ""Breaking: Czech Republic arms citizens. You can now shoot terrorists on sight."" First, this isn’t breaking news -- it refers to a proposed amendment in 2017 to create a constitutional right to keep and bear arms to assist the state against threats to national security.

"Gavin Newsom was ""the first to take on the National Rifle Association and win."""," In 2016, the Democrat and frontrunner in the race for California governor led the passage of Proposition 63. The voter-approved measure imposed background checks on ammunition purchases and required a state license to sell ammunition, among other provisions. Gun rights groups opposed it. But did that effort qualify Newsom as ""the first to take on the National Rifle Association and win""? That’s one of the claims in a new TV ad that aired statewide this week and was paid for by Newsom’s campaign.  Here’s the full text: ""The LA Times called Gavin Newsom ahead of the pack, from gay marriage to gun control. The first mayor to recognize marriage equality. The first to provide healthcare to every resident. The first to take on the National Rifle Association and win. The one candidate with a record of bold leadership and bold results. It’s why Kamala Harris, teachers, nurses and firefighters support Gavin Newsom for governor. Courage for a change."" In an article earlier this week, we took a broad look at the claims in Newsom’s TV ad, a 30-second spot called ""First."" We also examined claims in a separate TV ad supporting former Los Angeles mayor and candidate for governor Antonio Villaraigosa. With this fact check, we’ll take a deeper look at the claim Newsom was ""the first to take on the National Rifle Association and win."" Haven’t other California politicos taken on the NRA and won? 'Hardly the first' In a column for CALmatters, Dan Morain summarized efforts by other Californians who pushed for gun safety measures — decades before Newsom. We used that summary as a guide and inspected additional gun control efforts in the state. As noted by Morain, Newsom was ""hardly the first California big city politician to take on the NRA."". Sherry Bebitch Jeffee, professor of public policy at USC, added the claim about Newsom being ""first,"" doesn’t hold up to the facts. ""California’s been at the forefront of the gun control movement for a very long time,"" Jeffee said. Here’s a look at earlier efforts by prominent California politicians: Dianne Feinstein In 1983, then-San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein defeated an NRA-supported recall, Morain noted. The recall started after Feinstein backed a failed statewide initiative to regulate handguns. Feinstein’s signature gun control measure came two years into her career in the U.S. Senate. She introduced and helped pass the now-expired 1994 federal assault weapons ban, which was also opposed by the NRA. Tom Bradley In 1989, then-Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley signed a city ordinance that banned the sale or possession of semi-automatic weapons. Morain described that as ""as a landmark bill at a time when the NRA was able to win elections in California."" Antonio Villaraigosa Villaraigosa also has gun control credentials. In 1999, then-Assembly Speaker Villaraigosa helped pass a statewide assault weapons ban, though he did not author it. ""The time is now to ban assault weapons,"" he was quoted as saying in a San Francisco Chronicle article at the time. ""It is time to use the power of the Legislature to say with one loud voice that we should all move beyond Columbine."" Luis Vizcaino, a spokesman for Villaraigosa’s campaign for governor, described the former LA mayor’s gun control efforts in a statement to PolitiFact California: ""Mayor Villaraigosa has been taking on the NRA throughout his career. Under his speakership, California passed some of the boldest gun control measures in the country, including what was at the time the toughest assault weapons ban in the nation and greater oversight of gun shows -- all of which was vigorously opposed by the NRA."" More from Newsom Newsom’s gun control history isn’t limited to 2016. During his time as San Francisco's mayor, Newsom signed into law the voter-approved Proposition H in 2005. It outlawed citizens from possessing handguns and prevented the manufacture, sale and distribution of guns and ammunition in the city. However, it was struck down by a San Francisco Superior Court judge less than a year after it was passed. In a phone interview earlier this week, Newsom’s campaign spokesman Nathan Click expanded on the claim that Newsom was ""the first to take on the National Rifle Association and win."" He clarified that it was intended to show Newsom was the ""first person in California history to propose and pass a statewide ballot measure strengthening gun safety laws."" As the claim is made in the ad, text appears showing a headline ""Newsom Fights The NRA Over Gun Control."" This appears to be a reference to an October 2017 Los Angeles Times news article with a similar headline. It describes Newsom’s request that a federal judge lift an order that blocked Proposition 63’s ban on large-capacity ammunition magazines. We didn’t find any information in the article or elsewhere showing Newsom’s argument swayed the judge to lift the order. ""When you’re trying to convey a series of ideas in 30 seconds, you’re limited by the format,"" Click added. He said the ad did not intend to discount earlier accomplishments by other California politicians. While that’s helpful, PolitiFact places ratings on the original statements, not revisions or clarifications. Our ruling A TV advertisement by the Gavin Newsom for Governor campaign claimed Newsom was ""the first to take on the National Rifle Association and win."" The claim, however, ignores major gun control measures passed by California politicians from U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein to former Los Angeles mayors Tom Bradley and Antonio Villaraigosa, in the face of NRA opposition. Newsom’s campaign spokesman said the claim in the ad was meant to convey a more specific accomplishment, showing Newsom as the first to push through a statewide gun safety ballot measure. We’re not challenging that statement",False,"April 27, 2018"
"""Since 1999, firearm deaths in Ohio have risen 58 percent.""","Richard Cordray, a Democrat who has supported gun rights in the past, is playing defense during the Ohio primary for governor on his position on guns. Cordray received an A grade from the NRA and was endorsed by the Buckeye Firearms Association in 2010 when he ran for Ohio Attorney General. But during this campaign he has stated his support for some changes to gun laws, including universal background checks and raising the age to purchase a firearm to 21 in Ohio. One of his May 8 primary opponents, Dennis Kucinich, has portrayed Cordray as soft on guns and attacked him for helping a gun-rights group hold a rally in 2010. On his 2018 campaign website, Cordray has raised concerns about homicide and suicide gun deaths. ""The numbers are truly alarming,"" Cordray wrote, and then cited a series of statistics about gun violence including this one: ""Since 1999, firearm deaths in Ohio have risen 58 percent."" Cordray is correct about the increase in firearm deaths in Ohio since 1999. Although he didn’t address the reasons behind the increase, we will explain some of the evidence about the increase. Cordray’s campaign pointed to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing the increase in firearm deaths. There were 8.28 firearm deaths per 100,000 residents in Ohio in 1999 rising to 13.12 in 2016 -- an increase of 58 percent. There was an increase in both the rate of firearm deaths in suicides and homicides. Firearm death data Ohio in 1999 Ohio in 2016 Rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 8.28 13.12 Sheer number of firearm deaths 939 1,524   Cordray used a CDC set of data that started in 1999. But if we looked back a few years earlier in the 1990s, we found a higher rate of firearm deaths -- for example 11.73 in 1991. So if Cordray had drawn on a comparison from an earlier year in the 1990s, it wouldn’t show as much of a contrast as comparing 1999 and 2016. Why gun deaths have increased in Ohio is the more difficult question to answer -- something that Cordray didn’t comment about on his website. Randolph Roth, co-founder of the Historical Violence Database at Ohio State University, told PolitiFact that there has been a tremendous surge in homicides in recent years in Ohio’s major cities. The year 2016 was Cleveland’s deadliest year in a decade. The Cleveland Plain Dealer reported that Cleveland's uptick in homicides was particularly significant but continued an upward trend that began in 2014 and intensified in 2015. Richard Rosenfeld, a criminology professor at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, pointed to the opioid crisis as a factor in the increase in homicides in Ohio. Using CDC data, he showed that the increases in firearm deaths are primarily in the midwest and Ohio. ""The opioid increase is disproportionately concentrated in the midwest and also concentrated among whites,"" Rosenfeld told PolitiFact. Rosenfeld elaborated on that point in a 2017 paper for the National Institute of Justice in which he called for more research on the causes behind the homicide rise. Jim Irvine, a volunteer with the Buckeye Firearms Association, noted that CDC data shows an increase in suicides overall and that ""guns are one of several methods/tools used."" CDC data shows that the rate of suicides both by firearms -- and without firearms -- increased between 1999 and 2016 in Ohio. The Buckeye Firearms Association hasn’t endorsed in the Democratic primary but did endorse Attorney General Mike DeWine in the Republican primary. The association endorsed Cordray for Attorney General when he ran against DeWine in 2010. Cordray said on his website that ""since 1999, firearm deaths in Ohio have risen 58 percent."" Data from the Centers for Disease Control showed that there were 8.28 firearm deaths per 100,000 residents in Ohio in 1999 rising to 13.12 in 2016 -- an increase of 58 percent. Firearm deaths in suicides and homicides increased. If Cordray had selected an earlier year in the 1990s, the contrast would not have been as extreme when there was a higher rate of firearm deaths. However, his comparison of 1999 and 2016 is one valid way to examine the data",Mostly True,"April 12, 2018"
"""Paul Ryan has blocked all action to strengthen our gun laws.""","After the Florida school shooting that left 17 people dead, news reports said U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan had thrown cold water on, and shown little interest in, new proposals for gun control. But an attack on the Wisconsin Republican by Giffords PAC, a political action committee named for Gabrielle Giffords, went much further. Ryan ""has blocked all action to strengthen our gun laws,"" Giffords PAC claimed in an online ad released March 13, 2018. As the House speaker since October 2015, Ryan holds one of the most powerful positions in Washington, although other lawmakers, such as committee chairs, have influence over the fate of legislation. And all, of course, is an extreme word. So, let’s see what the record shows on Ryan and gun laws during his time as speaker. Giffords PAC Giffords is a former Democratic U.S. House member from Arizona. In 2011, she was shot while meeting with constituents in Tucson. The shooter killed six people and wounded 13 others. Giffords PAC describes itself as backing elected officials and candidates ""who step up to fight the gun violence epidemic."" Two weeks before releasing the Ryan ad, the PAC launched a campaign that included Ryan as one of six lawmakers on a #VoteThemOut list. Two Democrats are running for the southern Wisconsin seat held by Ryan, who hasn’t yet announced whether he will run for re-election in November 2018. The PAC’s evidence To back its attack on Ryan, Giffords PAC cited a dozen pieces of gun legislation that were pending since Ryan became speaker. Here are five, each of which was referred to a House committee, but was not voted out of that committee for a vote by the full House: Bill Key provision HR 1217 Reauthorize grants for improvements to the criminal history record system HR 2216 Prohibits sale of gun to person who is subject to restraining order HR 3130 Makes it crime to knowingly give/sell gun to person convicted of misdemeanor stalking HR 1475 Prohibits giving false or misleading material information in connection with a firearm purchase or transfer HR 1478 Ends prohibition on U.S. Department of Health and Human Services using federal funds to promote gun control Giffords PAC argues that the bills were blocked by Ryan by virtue of the fact that the main power of the House speaker -- as explained by a Washington Post primer on House leadership -- ""derives from his or her ability to determine what bills come to the floor for debate and a vote."" But the PAC provided no evidence that Ryan actually took steps to block the bills. And bills can be blocked by other lawmakers, such as committee chairs. Now to whether there are gun measures that Ryan has not blocked. Ryan’s response To refute the attack, Ryan’s campaign organization cited three measures that passed the House: Measure Key provisions HR 2646 More beds for people with mental illness who need short-term hospitalization HR 4909 Grants to improve school security, including with metal detectors, and to fund training, threat assessments, school and police coordination HR 38 Let people with concealed carry license bring guns across state lines; strengthen National Instant Criminal Background Check System The first two bills make no reference to guns, even if the school measure is aimed at fighting gun violence. The other bill, however, did strengthen background checks, even if it it would also permit additional transportation of guns across state lines. Ryan’s campaign also argued that Ryan has not stood in the way of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives from banning bump stocks -- which accelerate a gun’s firing speed -- with regulations using existing law. But it’s not clear that ATF could do so without new legislation; indeed, the Justice Department has said it does not have the legal authority under current law to do so. And Ryan has indicated that the House would not take up a bill that would explicitly allow a ban. Our rating Giffords PAC says: ""Paul Ryan has blocked all action to strengthen our gun laws."" The anti-gun violence political action committee cited a dozen gun-control measures that didn’t get to a vote in the House. So, it’s clear that Ryan did not move to bring those measures to the floor. But that’s not the same as Ryan himself blocking the measures, given that other lawmakers, such as committee chairs, also have such power. Also, a bill that would strengthen background checks did pass the House -- although it also expanded gun rights, by making it legal for licensed concealed carry holders to bring guns across state lines",Mostly False,"April 6, 2018"
"""It begins: Florida police now confiscating guns from people with no due process.""","After the Parkland school shooting, Florida lawmakers passed a so-called ""red flag"" law that aims to keep guns out of the hands of people deemed to be a threat to others or themselves. The new law went into effect March 9, quickly stoking concern among people about lost freedom. A March 18 headline posted on the Free Thought Project said, ""It begins: Florida police now confiscating guns from people with no due process."" The post went on to say a man in Lighthouse Point — in Broward County, like Parkland — had his guns taken away before he was determined to be mentally unfit and before he was accused of a crime, making him the first person in the state to ""have his due process removed."" Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. The post makes it seem like a man’s guns were taken without reason or cause, but that leaves out important nuance about the situation. Authorities said the man voluntarily surrendered his weapons and never contested the temporary risk protection order barring him from his guns for up to a year. Florida legislators moved quickly to pass SB 7026, allowing law enforcement to seek a risk protection order from a judge that would temporarily remove a person’s firearm(s) for up to a year. It also bars those individuals from buying guns during that time. Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri took issue with the way the law has been portrayed in headlines. He said if a person doesn’t comply with a risk protection order, then police have to file a warrant and establish probable cause to obtain the weapon. ""There is no seizure authority,"" Gualtieri said. ""You can ask them to comply with the risk protection order, but you can’t seize a person’s guns."" The law slightly amended the Baker Act, under which law enforcement officials can take someone against their will to a facility for a mental health evaluation if the person is a danger to themselves or others. Authorities can confiscate a person’s guns if they pose a potential danger to themselves or have made a credible threat of violence against another person. Before this change, the Baker Act didn’t state whether guns should be taken or returned, except to ban guns from hospitals providing mental health services. In practice, officers would often — but not always — temporarily confiscate guns if the firearms were on the person or in plain sight during the Baker Act ""episode,"" said Martha Lenderman, an expert on the Baker Act. More states added similar ""red flag"" laws this year including Washington. Matt Agorist, who wrote the Free Thought Project article, argued that Florida’s new law allows law enforcement officers to retain guns without due process. ""When a person is stripped of their constitutional rights, albeit temporarily, without being given the chance to make their own case based on what can be entirely arbitrary accusations, this is the removal of due process,"" Agorist said in an email to PolitiFact Florida. However, this neglects the fact that the person in question allowed police to retain his guns at the time he was taken into custody under the Baker Act. After this, Lighthouse Point police took the necessary steps to obtain a temporary risk protection order, which a judge reviewed and signed. PolitiFact Florida interviewed Lighthouse Point Police Chief Ross Licata and Broward County’s chief judge to get an understanding of the incident that led to a 56-year-old man losing his weapons. Licata said officers have had interactions with the man for years, but it wasn’t until early March that his actions warranted action. (PolitiFact Florida is not naming the man because of his condition.) On March 7, Lighthouse Point Police checked on the man at his condo after an anonymous person filed a complaint that he was acting strangely. According to court records, the person said the man had been seen around the community ""clutching his face and hair while arguing with himself."" The complainant also said the man had admitted to turning off the main electrical breakers to the condo building ""to prevent them from sending electrical impulses through his body and controlling him."" Licata said that this was causing a safety issue for other residents who depend on oxygen. During the police welfare check, the man said he was being targeted by one of his neighbors, who he said shape-shifts and looks like Osama bin Laden. The man was carrying a firearm in the outer pocket of his cargo pants, according to court records. The man voluntarily surrendered his weapons during the welfare check, said Broward’s chief administrative judge, Circuit Judge Jack Tuter. After that, police determined the man was a risk to himself and others and took him into custody under the Baker Act. Licata said the subject was not released from the medical center until March 21. Before he was released, police petitioned the court to get a temporary ex parte order and a permanent risk protection order March 14 to retain the man’s guns. (An ex parte orders allows the court to proceed temporarily without both parties present for a hearing. In this case, the man was still being held at a medical facility.) Law enforcement met with the man at his condo March 21 to remove additional ammunition. One week after his release, there was a final hearing to determine if the guns and ammunition should be removed for one year. The man was there. He did not contest the one-year risk protection order requested by police. Tuter signed the order preventing him from owning or purchasing guns. A headline on the Free Thought Project said, ""Florida police now confiscating guns from people with no due process."" The headline and the story make it appear that Florida police arbitrarily took away a man’s guns, and that’s not the case. The man in question voluntarily gave his weapons to police before he was taken into custody under the Baker Act, a judge said. While the man was being treated, Lighthouse Point police followed the protocol for obtaining a temporary risk protection order, and the man did not contest the order at any point during the court proceedings",False,"April 4, 2018"

"Many March for Our Lives speakers called for ""the murder of those who would not turn over their guns to the government.""","Maddie King, who survived a shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida that left 17 people dead, called on politicians to care more about their children than their guns. David Hogg, a Stoneman Douglas student and frequent whipping boy of gun rights advocates, said politicians should get their resumes ready. Another Stoneman Douglas student, Cameron Kasky, warned politicians who oppose stricter gun laws. ""Either represent the people or get out. Stand for us or beware: The voters are coming,"" Kasky said. Thousands of Americans gathered in streets around the United States on March 24 to honor victims of gun violence and, generally speaking, to advocate for stricter gun laws. According to a North Carolina legislator, some March For Our Lives speakers also called for a far more nefarious approach. State Rep. Beverly Boswell, a Republican from the coast, suggested on her Facebook page that speakers at the marches expressed violent intentions. ""Many of the speakers at these rallies were calling for gun registration, confiscation, Second Amendment repeal and even the murder of those who would not turn over their guns to the government,"" Boswell wrote on her campaign Facebook page. Murder? That seems harsh. Boswell, who’s in her first term representing House DIstrict 6, has been an open critic of efforts to toughen gun laws. She recently referred to students who participated in the national school walkout as ""Tide pod"" eaters and boasted on Facebook about confronting a school leader who held an assembly on that day — which he says was simply to honor the victims of Parkland shooting. She was also recently scolded by the North Carolina Board of Nursing for misrepresenting herself as a nurse. Boswell’s comments about March For Our Lives were part of a side conversation on her Facebook page after she posted a photo of some students with the caption, ""They’re out to take your guns, and our freedoms,"" at 8:10 p.m. on March 26. On March 27, she posted the comments about the march speakers after someone suggested Boswell’s original post was a ""scare tactic"" meant to distract people from the message of the march. What the ‘march’ wants The March For Our Lives website doesn’t say anything about forcefully taking guns from gun owners, much less harming them. The organization says it wants universal, comprehensive background checks and a digitized, searchable database of guns at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (known as ATF). It also wants bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, as well as funds for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to research gun violence. March For Our Lives has the support of several large, liberal organizing groups that support gun control. And a survey of the Washington marchers found that protesters there were largely liberal, with 79 percent of those who were randomly surveyed identifying as ""left-leaning."" But the group doesn’t appear to have ties to groups with a history of advocating violence. PolitiFact recently debunked a claim by the National Rifle Association that the March For Our Lives is ""backed by radicals with a history of violent threats, language and actions."" A story by Variety.com captured some of the marchers’ public disdain for the NRA, but none of the views expressed included calls for violence. ""A video during the [Washington] event showed NRA officials, like Wayne LaPierre and Dana Loesch, as well as [the late actor] Charlton Heston, then the president of the organization, saying, ‘From my cold dead hands.’ In the crowd the images drew boos and the bird,"" Variety reported. In New York City, ""Marchers chanted ‘NRA sashay away,’ at the New York rally, holding posters decrying the involvement of the National Rifle Association in government,"" Variety reported. PolitiFact emailed Boswell and asked if she could provide videos or news clips showing march speakers advocating violence. Luke Stancil, her campaign spokesman, responded by referencing a candidate for sheriff in North Carolina who joked about taking people's guns.  Daryl Fisher, a candidate running for sheriff of Buncombe County in western NC, explained his views of people who invite him to pry their gun from their cold, bare hands. Stancil pointed out that Fisher shrugged said, ""OK ... Whenever you pass away, we'll come get it."" Fisher indeed said those things. But he didn't say them at a March For Our Lives rally. He later apologized. And Boswell said ""many"" speakers called for the murder of gun owners – and didn't cite any others.  So we searched for evidence of violent rhetoric ourselves. What speakers said Alex Jones, a conservative conspiracy theorist who runs InfoWars.com, said on his show that marchers declared they would ""kill anyone"" who doesn’t turn in their guns. But PolitiFact found no credible evidence of rally speakers calling for violence against gun owners who might refuse to relinquish their guns. Most speakers at the Washington march and other marches across the country spoke about stricter gun laws and warned politicians of forthcoming punishment at the ballot box. Some of those comments, if taken out of context, could be misconstrued as threats. Delaney Tarr, a frequently-interviewed Stoneman Douglas student, said the Washington marchers are ""are here to call out every single politician. We will take action where it counts."" Those comments were preceded by a specific list of legislative demands that included an assault weapons ban, the ""prohibition of high capacity magazines, reinforcement of background checks and closing of loopholes."" In that vein, she said: ""When they give us that inch, that bump stock ban, we will take a mile."" Alex Wind, a junior at Stoneman Douglas, used the words ""life"" and ""death"" to describe where politicians stand on gun restrictions. ""To all the politicians out there, if you take money from the NRA, you have chosen death,"" Wind said. ""If you have not expressed to your constituents a public stance on this issue, you have chosen death. If you do not stand with us by saying we need to pass common sense gun legislation, you have chosen death. And none of the millions of people marching in this country today will stop until they see those against us out of office, because we choose life."" D’Angelo McDade, a student from North Lawndale College Prep in Chicago and members of the student non-violence group the Peace Warriors, specifically called for non-violent action. ""When will we as a nation understand that we are not here to fight against one another and we are here to fight for life and peace?"" McDade said. ""Dr. King once said, ‘Darkness cannot drive out darkness, only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that.’ Which now leads me to say that violence cannot drive out violence, only peace can do that."" Speakers at marches in Boswell’s home state of North Carolina were similar. Speakers in Raleigh, Durham, Charlotte, Greensboro and Asheville reportedly focused on gun laws and the NRA. Our ruling Boswell said ""many speakers"" at the March for Our Lives rallies were calling for ""the murder of those who would not turn over their guns to the government.""

"A bill in Congress ""will ban all semi-automatic weapons, including pistols and shotguns. So, yes, they are coming to take away our guns.""","The president of the state group affiliated with the National Rifle Association says a bill in Congress would ban all semi-automatic firearms and lead to the government seizing guns from gun owners. Tom King, president of the New York State Rifle and Pistol Association, appeared on The Capitol Pressroom to voice his group’s opposition to stronger gun control laws. ""The title of the bill is ‘something assault weapons ban,’ "" King said in the interview. ""And, when you read into it, the legislation will ban all semi-automatic weapons, including pistols and shotguns. So, yes, they are coming to take away our guns."" The group also wants to repeal the 2013 New York Secure Ammunition and Firearms Enforcement Act, the state’s gun law passed after the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre. Democrats have proposed some parts of the SAFE Act for the congressional bill, like universal background checks for gun purchases and a ban on certain accessories. But is King right that the bill would ban semi-automatic weapons altogether and lead to gun seizures? The bill Opponents of gun control have long chafed at the term ""assault weapon"" because it does not have a universal definition. The SAFE Act, for example, defines an assault weapon differently than the federal law that banned assault weapons in 1994. The federal ban expired in 2004, and many Democrats have tried to revive it ever since. King did not respond to our inquiry about his claim. In the Capitol Pressroom interview, he mentioned House Resolution 5057 as the bill he was referring to. But that bill has nothing to do with guns. It seems he mixed up his bill numbers. Rep. David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat, leads the latest gun-control effort as sponsor of House Resolution 5087, titled the Assault Weapons Ban of 2018. A Cicilline spokesperson said his office is not aware of any other current bills relating to an assault weapons ban. PolitiFact New York could not find any others in our search of House and Senate websites.  Cicilline's bill would ban the sale of new semi-automatic firearms with certain military-style features: • Rifles that can accept a detachable magazine would be banned from having a pistol grip, a forward grip, a threaded barrel, a barrel shroud, a grenade or rocket launcher, or a folding, telescoping, or detachable stock. • Pistols would not be allowed to have a fixed magazine with more than 10 rounds. They would also be banned from having a threaded barrel, a second pistol grip, a barrel shroud, and the ability to load a magazine at some location other than the grip. • Shotguns would be banned from having a detachable magazine and a fixed magazine would not be allowed to have more than five rounds. The same features banned for pistols and rifles would also be banned on shotguns. Semi-automatic weapons sold without any of those features would still be legal to own and sell. The gun would become illegal if the owner decided to add any of those features. Those who legally bought a gun with those features before the ban would not have to give them up. Those weapons would be grandfathered in, but a background check would be required if the owner sells it to someone else. They would also have to be locked up when not being used. The bill would also ban any magazine with more than 10 rounds. Six states already have a similar ban. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, introduced an almost identical bill in 2017. Neither has support from Republicans, who hold the majority in both chambers of Congress. Our ruling King said a bill in Congress ""will ban all semi-automatic weapons, including pistols and shotguns. So, yes, they are coming to take away our guns."" That’s not true. The latest bill to ban ""assault weapons"" would block the sale of new semi-automatic firearms with one or more military-style features. Guns that already have those features would be grandfathered in. Gun owners would not be required to give up any of their guns as long as they were legally purchased before the ban",False Pants on Fire,"March 29, 2018"
"""The United States is 3rd in murders throughout the world. If you remove Chicago, Detroit, Washington, St. Louis and New Orleans, the United States is then 189th out of 193 countries in the entire world.""","A viral meme shared on social media following the Parkland, Fla., shooting claimed the United States has the third-highest count of murders worldwide, a ranking that would drop dramatically if five major cities were excluded. The image has been circulating since at least 2015. We decided to take a closer look. Is the United States third in murders, and are a few outlier cities responsible? That’s false by any standard. The main study of intentional homicides is performed by the United Nations’ Office of Drug Control. The UN warns against cross-national comparisons because of the differences in legal definitions of intentional homicides and recording practices. Our count of the UN’s data placed the United States ninth in intentional homicides. We used the most up-to-date count for each country and territory, which included data anywhere from 2007 to 2015. As the country with the third-highest population size, however, experts told us the number of people killed is not a very useful metric. Controlling for population size, most criminologists use the per 100,000 metric. By that standard, we found the United States ranked 94th. When we counted only the countries for which the UN had 2015 data, the United States ranked 73rd. That’s still far from the top ten. The meme argues that a few outlier cities with stringent gun control legislation are responsible for the United States’ high homicide count. But that’s not true, either. Chicago, Detroit, Washington, St. Louis and New Orleans have homicide rates well above the national average, but that’s typical for large urban cities. While Detroit, St. Louis and New Orleans are consistently among the top five American cities by homicide rate, the cities with most per-capita murders vary from year to year. Neither Washington, D.C., nor Chicago make the top five. Chicago has a high number of homicides because of its population, but its homicide rate is middle of the road for large U.S. cities, according to Jay Corzine, a sociology professor at the University of Central Florida. Specific reasons for the cities’ high murder rates largely remain a mystery for criminologists, but all are cities with ""high poverty levels, inequality, significant segregation, and an entrenched drug trade,"" Corzine said. Dropping them from the U.S. total has little substantive impact on the U.S. homicide rate or count. The cities cited in the meme accounted for 1,568 of 17,250, or 9.1 percent, of all homicides reported to the FBI in 2016, Tom Kovandzic, a criminologist at the University of Texas, Dallas, calculated for us. And without those cities, the homicide rate (per capita) would only decline by 7.73 percent, or from 5.34 to 4.93. When we applied those reductions to the UN data, the United States barely budged in its international standing. It moved down four spots in per capita murders and stayed the same in total murders. That’s inconsequential compared with the 186-spot jump the meme concocted. Gun control laws are mostly controlled by state legislatures. Washington, D.C., is the only listed city able to enact strict ordinances, while Chicago can do some things, according to Darrel Stephens, executive director of the Major Cities Chiefs Association. We’ve previously rated the claim that Chicago has the strictest gun laws Pants on Fire. ""The other lie in this claim is that all five of the named cities have stringent gun regulation. Louisiana, Michigan and Missouri would be very surprised to hear that!"" said Philip Cook, a sociologist at Duke University. The states didn’t impress the Giffords Law Center, a pro-gun control group. Missouri ranked 48th, Louisiana 43rd, and Michigan 16th on a scale that gives higher rankings to restricted gun ownership and use. The image said, ""The United States is 3rd in murders throughout the world. If you remove Chicago, Detroit, Washington, St. Louis and New Orleans, the United States is then 189th out of 193 countries in the entire world."" By no measure is the United States third in total homicides or homicide rates. Excluding the named cities from the count had little to no impact on the United States’ international standing. Three of the cities named in the meme are consistently the top cities for intentional homicides in the United States, but the other two are not. They are by no means outliers, either",False Pants on Fire,"March 28, 2018"
"""Ohio student suspended for staying in class during National Walkout Day""","After an Ohio high school student’s suspension notice was posted on social media, claims went viral that he was suspended for not participating in National Walkout Day one month after the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas. ""Ohio student suspended for staying in class during National Walkout Day,"" a Fox News headline stated March 16. The Associated Press had a similar headline: ""Ohio student suspended for staying in class during walkouts."" Many right-leaning websites repeated the story about Jacob Shoemaker, a senior at Hilliard Davidson High School, located in a suburb of Columbus, with hashtags such as #LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder and #DefendThe2nd. Facebook users flagged the posts as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. Shoemaker’s suspension notice, posted on social media by a friend, stated: ""student refused to follow instructions after being warned repeatedly by several administrators."" While some social media posts presented the situation as the school punishing a student for refusing to call for gun control, the situation was actually more nuanced. Shoemaker was suspended following National Walkout Day when thousands of students nationwide walked out of school one month after the massacre in Parkland to protest gun violence and call for gun control. The first paragraph of the Fox News story shows that Shoemaker didn’t want to follow the alternative for students who didn’t want to attend the walkout: ""An Ohio high school student said he tried to stay apolitical during the National Walkout Day over gun violence but was suspended for his choice to remain in a classroom instead of joining protests or the alternative, going to study hall."" Shoemaker told Fox News that he didn’t want to take sides in the gun-control debate so he chose to stay in the classroom and do school work instead. ""They presented the situation of the national walkout in such a way to where it really seemed they were forcing me to make a choice, a political choice in the classroom,"" he said. ""I didn’t like that I was going to have to decide whether I was anti-violence and pro-gun control or if I was to stay inside and be pro-gun violence, effectively. It didn’t feel right to have to make that decision."" Shoemaker’s father Scott Shoemaker posted a message on Facebook March 16: ""My son was suspended for not leaving the room to either join a demonstration or reporting to the commons. He was uncomfortable going to either location as he thought that going outside would most likely be politicizing a horrific event which he wanted no part of, but staying inside would make him look disrespectful or insensitive to 17 innocent victims if it turned out to be more of a memorial service. ""This had nothing to do with his own political beliefs, but with politics in school in general. Students should not have been forced to leave their classrooms, choose a side, and be politically divided. He got support from students on both sides of the political aisle after returning today, but he felt there were other students and staff angry with him for taking this position."" Fox News reported a statement from the school: ""As a district, we are required to supervise students during the school day. We do not leave students unattended in classrooms. .... This is the same practice our district implements when students opt out of other school programs or activities. We provide an alternative, supervised location."" We found the school’s full statement on its website, which stated that no students were forced to participate in the walkout. ""In fact, student participation overall was well under 50 percent of the student population. The majority of students were comfortable and confident in not participating in these gatherings. Students who chose not to participate were provided safe, supervised alternatives in all three high schools. No one was forced or coerced to participate. No one was disciplined for not participating. Our school culture respects the rights of all students. We strive to provide a safe environment for all students, but we do expect students to follow directions and comply with staff requests. This is required to maintain an orderly school environment."" School spokeswoman Stacie Raterman told PolitiFact that students opting not to attend the walkout were able to go to supervised study halls in different classrooms and the commons area. She said she couldn’t comment on any individual student’s discipline due to federal privacy laws but said about a dozen students at Davidson were suspended after attending the memorial gathering but not returning to class. A Fox News network spokeswoman did not have any additional comment. Many online headlines said, ""Ohio student suspended for staying in class during National Walkout Day."" The headline in and of itself could lead viewers to reach a misleading conclusion that the student was suspended for simply opting out of the walkout. But the story states that he was suspended because he didn’t take the alternative the school district offered, which was to attend a supervised study hall instead. The school said that less than half of the students participated in the walk out and that no one was disciplined for opting out of it, but they had to remain in a place supervised by staff",Half True,"March 28, 2018"
"""States that have implemented waiting periods have seen significant decreases in suicides.""","In his first speech on the Senate floor, Sen. Doug Jones, D-Ala., waded into the nation’s fraught debate over gun violence. Jones, who defeated Roy Moore in Alabama’s December 2017 special Senate election, voiced support for steps to reduce the rate of gun-related deaths in America, including a federal measure to impose mandatory waiting periods on the purchase of firearms. ""States that have implemented waiting periods have seen significant decreases in suicides,"" Jones said in a March 21 speech that sought to balance Second Amendment rights with gun control measures. Suicides accounted for just over 60 percent of the United States’ roughly 36,000 gun-related deaths in 2015, according to the most recent available government data. We decided to take a closer look at the research into waiting periods and suicide reduction. A waiting period is a mandatory delay that requires gun purchasers to wait — typically between two and seven days — before obtaining their weapons. Nine states and the District of Columbia have laws that require a waiting period for purchases of at least some types of guns, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. There is currently no federal waiting period for gun sales. Congress previously established a nationwide waiting period and background check for handgun sales through the 1994 Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act. The federal wait period was in effect for just under 5 years before the provision expired. Jones’ office pointed us to a 2000 study that looked at the effect of the Brady Law on gun violence and suicide. That study found waiting periods were associated with reductions in the firearm suicide rate for people age 55 and older. However, waiting periods were not linked to lower suicide rates overall, which suggests some opted for alternative means of suicide. We reached out to Philip Cook, one of the authors of the Brady Law study, who pointed us to more recent research focused on waiting times and gun violence.  One gun control expert told us the 2017 study, ""Handgun waiting periods reduce gun deaths,"" represented the best research on the relationship between waiting periods and suicides. (Note: Cook is listed as the study's editor.) Researchers studied every change to waiting period laws in the United States from 1970 and 2014, and compared the laws with changes in the government’s annual data on gun-related deaths. (Forty-three states plus the District of Columbia had a waiting period for at least some time between 1970 and 2014; researchers also looked at the federal Brady Law.) The study noted that delaying the purchase of a gun could create a ""cooling off"" period to allow a ""visceral state"" — including suicidal impulses — to subside before the gun buyer took possession of a firearm. Michael Luca, a professor at Harvard Business School and one of the study’s authors, pointed us to the key passage for purposes of checking Jones’ claim: ""Waiting periods lead to a 7–11 percent reduction in gun suicides (depending on the control variables used in the specification), which is equivalent to 22–35 fewer gun suicides per year for the average state."" ""Jones is on solid ground here,"" Luca said. Daniel W. Webster, the director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, described the study by Luca and his colleagues as ""the best research I can point to on the effects of waiting periods for gun purchases."" However, David Kopel, a policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute and author of several books on gun control, said the study ""has somewhat less certitude than Sen. Jones suggests."" He noted the findings’ statistical significance depended on which model was used.  In an October 2017 CNN article, Deepak Malhotra, a professor of negotiation and conflict resolution at Harvard Business School and Luca’s co-author, was somewhat measured when describing the study’s conclusions on suicide reduction. ""There seems to be a lot of evidence to suggest that suicides also are reduced, but further research might be necessary on that issue,"" Malhotra said. (We reached out to Malhotra but did not hear back.) Jones said, ""States that have implemented waiting periods have seen significant decreases in suicides."" A 2017 study on the relationship between waiting periods and suicides — which was cited by some foremost gun control experts — found waiting periods led to a 7–11 percent reduction in gun suicides. That’s the equivalent of 22–35 fewer gun suicides per year for the average state. That said, one expert said the statistical significance of the study’s findings depended on which model was used, and one of the study’s coathors was somewhat measured in describing the study’s conclusions with respect to the effect of waiting periods on suicide reduction",Mostly True,"March 24, 2018"
"""March For Our Lives is backed by radicals with a history of violent threats, language and actions.""","As the National Rifle Association sees it, the March For Our Lives taking place in Washington and in cities and communities nationwide, is a ploy to destroy the Second Amendment. On NRATV, host Grant Stinchfield said he is ""committed to exposing the violent, even deadly history of these people behind this weekend’s March For Our Lives, anti-gun fraud of a protest."" ""March For Our Lives is backed by radicals with a history of violent threats, language and actions,"" Stinchfield said March 21. The key evidence behind that claim? Stinchfield argued that the Women’s March, the massive protest the day after the inauguration of President Donald Trump in January 2017, is ""a major force behind"" the March For Our Lives. He further argued that the Women’s March organization is run by radicals with violent tendencies. Stinchfield’s first example: Singer Madonna telling a crowd that she felt so frustrated after the election that she ""thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House."" (""But I know that this won't change anything,"" she quickly added.) We explored the facts behind each link in that chain of association. The organization behind the March For Our Lives defies easy description, but one thing is clear: As an organization, the Women’s March is not a big player. The NRA broadcast mentioned Tamika Mallory, a Women’s March national co-chair. ""She has nothing to do with this,"" said Allan Mayer, co-CEO of 42West, the public relations firm for March For Our Lives. The NRA listed another Women’s March co-chair, Linda Sarsour. ""Absolutely no connection to what we’re doing,"" Mayer said. NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam pointed to an article on Bustle, a news, entertainment and beauty website, describing how the youth engagement arm of the Women’s March was promoting gun control activism. That’s true. The youth organizers have posted a detailed gun control policy including a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. They promoted the National School Walkout protest in mid March and provided a toolkit for young organizers who wanted to hold their own local events. But their website has only a single mention of the March For Our Lives. It is the 14th point on a page about the school walkout and says ""We will be at #March4OurLives too!"" It adds, ""It will take sustained action to end gun violence and we stand in solidarity with our peers who are also organizing around gun violence prevention."" The clearest link to the Women’s March comes in the person of Deena Katz, a producer of Dancing With the Stars and a co-executive director of the Women’s March Los Angeles Foundation. Through a personal connection to a family in Parkland, Fla., the site of the deadly school shooting, Katz stepped in early to work with the student activists at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Katz applied as an individual for the permits to march in Washington. She is the president of the March For Our Lives Action Fund, a 501(c)(4) nonprofit established to fund the march and future lobbying on gun control. But Mayer at 42West said Katz is doing this on her own, separate from the Los Angeles Women’s March group. A spokesperson for the LA group told Buzzfeed in February that the organization itself was not involved. The march has been a magnet for the many advocacy organizations that have pressed for gun control over many years. The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence and Sandy Hook Promise all promote the march. Two organizations, Everytown for Gun Safety and Giffords Courage to Fight, are playing a prominent role in organizing sibling marches around the country and providing logistical muscle for the main march in Washington. Everytown — along with its grassroots organizing arm Moms Demand Action — has funded local marches, and maintains an interactive map showing where they are taking place. Everytown for Gun Safety receives significant support from former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Giffords Courage to Fight emerged after the shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School and is the project of gun victim and former Rep. Gabby Giffords, D-Ariz., and her husband Mark Kelly. The liberal activist group MoveOn and Planned Parenthood also actively support the march. Planned Parenthood lists 14 local marches on its website. The Episcopal Diocese of Washington is coordinating housing and meals for out-of-town visitors. March For Our Lives has had no trouble securing hefty donations from Hollywood stars, companies and philanthropists. George and Amal Clooney pledged $500,000, a sum that was quickly matched by Oprah Winfrey, Steven Spielberg and Kate Capshaw, and others. The Italian fashion company Gucci gave $500,000, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff pledged $1 million, as did billionaire philanthropist Eli Broad. The march also raised more than $3 million online through a GoFundMe campaign. The NRA said that the March For Our Lives is ""backed by radicals with a history of violent threats, language and actions."" That allegation rested on the idea that the Women’s March played a major role in the march, and the NRA host mentioned two co-chairs by name. We found no evidence that either the organization or those people are directly involved in the march. The Women’s March website doesn’t even list the gun control march as an upcoming event. The only significant tie between the marches is a producer who leads the Los Angeles chapter of the Women’s March. But the chapter said it is not involved, and the producer has acted on her own to apply for permits and establish the March For Our Lives’ nonprofit support fund. Major organizational muscle behind the march, both in Washington and in cities nationwide, comes from two well-known gun control advocacy groups, neither of which has a history of violent behavior. A number of related organizations have lent their support, including the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, and celebrity donors have given millions of dollars.

I’m not going to apologize for standing up for safer communities and for victims. And I think that we can do that while also trying to address racial injustice and the problem of mass incarceration. 2. Just look at our president and you have to worry about equal protection under the law. Women are under attack. We have to protect our environment. 3. I believe we (Burns and her) share many of the same values, and I hope that we can unite Wisconsinites to fight against right-wing special interests and make our state Supreme Court work for the people again. But in the next three statements in which Dallet talked about her values, she went further. Dallet talked about not making it more difficult to vote, alluding to the debate over whether Wisconsin’s photo ID law makes it more difficult to vote; she attacked the National Rifle Association, which is known for its activism to protect gun-owner rights; and she flatly stated that sales of a particular gun should be outlawed. 4. I believe in clean air and water, I believe in our public education system and I believe in working people. I think we need to ensure we increase participation in our voting system, not decrease it. I think we need to address racial and gender inequality head on, not sweep the vestiges of a racist and patriarchal system under the rug. 5. That’s why I took the #NoNRAMoney pledge. I will not accept money from an organization that puts profits above the lives of Americans. Will you join me today in pledging that we won’t vote for any candidate who takes NRA money? nonramoney.org/voter-pledge #NRABoycott 6. Why do you need that rifle that was used in that (Parkland, Fla.) school shooting? What was it, an AR-15? Who ever needs to fire off that many rounds in a minute? There is no reason for that gun. There is no basis for it. It’s not a gun that should be sold in the United States. I mean, let’s talk about reasonable gun control …. I’m not going to write that law, that’s going to be our legislatures. But we should all -- I mean, I’m a citizen just like everyone else -- we should all write our legislatures, tell them how we think and let them write those laws. Recusal rule On the remaining two statements, Lovejoy told us that when Dallet speaks about changing policy, ""she's referencing the need to update the Supreme Court recusal policy that currently allows sitting justices,"" such as retiring Justice Michael Gableman, ""to remain on cases where a party spent significantly on their behalf in their election."" Here are those Dallet statements: 7. It is the time for women. It’s a time for making sure we stand up and our rights are protected. And experience matters to get the policies we want to move forward and to protect our rights. That statement was made during the concluding remarks of a campaign appearance. Dallet had begun her remarks talking about her experience as a prosecutor and judge, then she talked at length about the importance of the recusal rule, and then she spoke about the experience Screnock and Burns have, before concluding. It could be argued that in making the ""policies we want"" statement, Dallet was echoing her remarks about recusals rather than making a general statement about the need ""get the policies we want."" But in the final statement, from a radio interview, it’s harder to see the argument that Dallet was referring to recusals. 8. All of the values that I talked about -- clean air and water, and equal protection, and women -- are under attack.  And, this is something we all feel and we all relate to. And I'm the candidate that is going to be able to protect those values at this critical time, and there is just too much at stake right now to have someone without the experience needed to advocate for the policies that need to be changed and to make sure to protect those values. Dallet had been asked earlier in the interview about recusals. But she made the statement we cite when asked about about why she featured criticism of President Donald Trump in her first TV campaign ad. Our rating Screnock says Dallet ""has talked about her interest in advocating for policies that need to be changed to achieve her political objectives."" Dallet frequently says she is merely stating her values, such as equal rights or clean air and water, and often she singles out those issues without advocating for a particular policy position. But on some occasions she has gone beyond that. For example, after citing clean air and water, and equal protection as her values, she pledged to ""advocate for the policies that need to be changed."" And she has advocated for addressing ""mass"" incarceration; increasing voter participation and not allowing the sale of AR-15 guns",Mostly True,"March 21, 2018"
"Shoes on the Capitol lawn represent 7,182 students who were killed in U.S. schools since 2012.","Thousands of pairs of shoes dotted the lawn of the U.S. Capitol this week, prompting photos and media coverage about what it meant. Global activist group Avaaz set up the demonstration of 7,000 pairs of shoes on March 13 to represent child deaths from gun violence since the 2012 Sandy Hook school massacre. Many major news outlets including CNN and USA Today shared striking images of the shoes, but some Internet bloggers were confused about what the shoes really symbolized. Take, for example, Equality House, one of many blogs that shared this post on their Facebook page: The image says that shoes on the Capitol lawn represent 7,182 students ""killed in U.S. schools since 2012."" (The image offers a comparison to deaths from overseas wars since 2001, which is a safer estimate.) But that’s the wrong interpretation. It’s been more than five years since Sandy Hook, so the display featured 7,000 pairs of shoes. That total includes children who are killed at home, in neighborhoods, and by suicide. Far fewer children have been killed in schools. The estimate for 7,000 child gun deaths traces back to a June 2017 study by Pediatrics, a peer-reviewed journal. It found that 1,300 children die from gunshot wounds every year. The study looked at children from birth to 17 years of age. The Avaaz news release stated that the shoes symbolize the children who have been killed by all gun violence since the Sandy Hook school shooting, not children killed in U.S. schools. There isn’t one uniform way of tracking school shootings and deaths, but no matter which what you look at it, the 7,000-figure isn't accurate. The New York Times published an analysis of the number of people who have been shot in school shootings on Feb. 15, the day after the Parkland school shootings. Using data from the Gun Violence Archive, the Times found that 138 people have been killed in school shootings since Sandy Hook. That total includes school personnel who are not students, so the number of students would be even smaller. The Gun Violence Archive defines a school shooting as an incident that occurs on the property of an elementary, secondary or college campus and only included incidents in which people were injured or killed. So, even if you count all of the other instances of a student being killed on a school campus (for which there is no official count) it’s likely it would not come anywhere near 7,182.  Equality House, for its part, noted the difference between the image and the way Avaaz described it in the caption of its post. But the group still circulated the flawed information and did not delete it.  Bloggers said shoes on the Capitol lawn this week represented 7,182 students killed in U.S. schools since 2012. That’s not accurate. The pairs of shoes symbolized more than 7,000 children who had been killed by gun violence since the Sandy Hook school shooting. The number of children killed in school violence, while fluid, is certainly smaller than that total",False,"March 16, 2018"
"""Half of the American women who are murdered are killed by their intimate partners.""","Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo wants state lawmakers to pass a bill he believes would prevent more women from being murdered by people close to them. The bill would remove guns from people convicted on misdemeanor domestic violence charges. Guns are currently only taken away if someone has a felony conviction for domestic violence. ""Half of the American women who are murdered are killed by their intimate partners,"" Cuomo said at a March 13 rally. The bill is part of Cuomo’s 2018 Women’s Agenda, a list of more than two dozen proposals concerning healthcare, equal pay and gun violence among other issues. The domestic violence bill doubles as one of the governor’s proposals to add to the state’s gun control laws. New York state already has one of the lowest rates of gun-caused death in the country, but Cuomo believes the proposal could drive that number lower. Is he right that half of women murdered in the U.S. are killed by their intimate partners? The data Cuomo’s claim comes from data released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2017. The agency looked at the homicides of 10,018 adult women in 18 states from 2003 to 2014. The circumstances of the homicide were known in 8,028 of the cases. Of those, 4,442 homicides, or 55.3 percent, were related to intimate partner violence. The report defines an intimate partner as a current, former, or unspecified spouse or romantic partner. Women killed while intervening in an incident of intimate partner violence, like a friend or family member, were also counted in this category. Almost 80 percent of intimate partner homicides involved a current intimate partner.  About 11 percent of victims had experienced violence in the month preceding their death. An argument preceded the victim’s death in about a third of intimate partner homicides, the report found. Gun-involved homicides The report does not include data on the criminal history of the suspects. It’s not known what share had a history of domestic violence. But the agency did collect information on the type of weapon used in each homicide. A firearm was used in 5,234 of the total homicides, or almost 54 percent. That’s more than double the number of victims killed with a sharp instrument, the next most-documented weapon. The authors of the report suggest legislation like Cuomo’s could help prevent more female homicides in the future. ""State statutes limiting access to firearms for persons under a domestic violence restraining order can serve as another preventive measure associated with reduced risk for intimate partner homicide and firearm intimate partner homicide,"" the report said. A report from the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics found an estimated 45 percent of female homicide victims were killed by an intimate partner in 2007. New York state data Numbers in New York state mirror national data. About 48 percent of female domestic homicides in New York state involved an intimate partner in 2016, according to a report from the state Division of Criminal Justice Services. A firearm was used in about a third of all domestic homicides in New York state. The state data does not include homicides where there was no known relationship between the suspect and victim. Our ruling Cuomo said ""Half of the American women who are murdered are killed by their intimate partners."" Data collected by the CDC supports Cuomo’s claim. More than half of the female homicides the agency studied involved an intimate partner when the relationship was known",True,"March 16, 2018"
"""Research shows that 1 percent of licensed dealers supply a whopping 57 percent of the guns that are recovered in crimes.""","As tens of thousands of students across the country walked out of their schools to protest gun violence, members of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee examined school safety procedures and gun policies ahead of the Parkland school shooting.   During the hearing, Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., repeated a talking point among people who support gun restrictions and expressed the need to keep guns out of the hands of criminals. He said most guns used in crime come from only a handful of places. ""We see guns pouring into our community, and we have found that a significant number of them are coming from a very small group of retailers that sell to criminals or straw purchasers,"" Booker said March 14, a month after the school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.   He turned to Thomas Brandon, acting director of the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives: ""You’re aware of that, correct?"" Brandon said yes, but Booker took the claim a step further: ""We know the research shows that 1 percent of licensed dealers supply a whopping 57 percent of the guns that are recovered in crimes."" Brandon said Booker’s claim rested on outdated research. ""Yes, senator. That’s a study that, I think, is over 20 years old,"" Brandon said. ""I would not agree with that statistic today."" Booker continued to press Brandon about the distribution between licensed gun dealers and guns recovered in crimes and then talked about the need for more research on gun violence. Still, the differing assertions made us wonder about Booker’s statistic. As we’ve found in the past, a federal report from 2000 backs this up. But there are several caveats worth pointing out. Booker's point matches data from a 2000 report from the federal Bureau of the Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Department. The report found that 1.2 percent of licensed gun dealers accounted for more than 57 percent of the crime guns traced to current dealers in 1998. The study looked at the number of licensed retail dealers and pawnbrokers nationwide and aimed to track the movement of a firearm recovered by law enforcement officials from its first sale by the manufacturer. An ATF spokesman said the agency no longer uses that study to evaluate current crime trends. Frank Kelsey, chief of the public affairs division at ATF, said tracing a gun used in a crime back to a dealer does not necessarily indicate illegal activity by the dealer or its employees. And he noted that a gun might have changed hands any number of times — legally or illegally — before it was used in a crime. That said, there isn’t any more up-to-date information on the subject — and there’s a reason for that. In 2003, Congress and the George W. Bush administration, with the support of the National Rifle Association, passed the Tiahrt Amendment, which forbids ATF from sharing information about guns it has traced with the public except with state and local police agencies in the course of a criminal investigation. Two of the experts we reached out to (Daniel Webster, the director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, and Jaclyn Schildkraut, assistant professor of Public Justice, State University of New York at Oswego) said that they wouldn’t completely dismiss the findings of the 2000 report, unless there was any evidence that showed otherwise. Still, more information is needed. Glenn L. Pierce, the director of the Institute of Security and Public Policy at Northeastern University, helped compile the ATF’s 2000 analysis. Pierce said the pattern found in 1998, when there were 105,563 federal firearms licensees, is very similar to the pattern identified in the 1995/1996 first report to ATF, at which time there were about 258,000 federal firearms licensees. ""At least over those years, the pattern stayed very much the same even (as) the number of (federal firearms licensees) showed a steep decline due to legislation implemented in 1994 during the Clinton administration,"" he said. Still, he said, it would be necessary for ATF to conduct another study to determine the extent to which this is actually the case today. ""The firearms trace patterns found in the 1995 and 2000 reports might well persist today, but it would be necessary for ATF to conduct such a trace data analysis to determine the extent to which this actually the case."" Booker said, ""Research shows that 1 percent of license dealers supply a whopping 57 percent of the guns that are recovered in crimes. Booker made his claim in the present tense, but the data that backs his point is almost 20 years old. We do not have better data to represent the current picture. The 2000 report traced the purchases of guns used in crimes back to the original dealer. But it didn’t take into account whether the firearm changed hands, illegally or legally, before it was used in a crime. That said, Booker is relying on the latest, best data available. Booker’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important information about the study's age",Half True,"March 16, 2018"
"""A quarter of our guns are sold outside of the background checks.""","Reacting to the school shooting in Parkland, Fla. that killed 17 people, U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin spoke out for universal background checks -- that is, requiring them for every gun sale. The Wisconsin Democrat said universal checks are supported by 97 percent of gun owners, a claim we rated Mostly True, based on the latest national polling of households that have guns. Clearly, the checks -- the potential buyer shows identification, completes a federal form and goes through an instant criminal background check -- are not required for all gun sales. Indeed, under federal law, only federally licensed gun dealers, importers and manufacturers must run the checks. So, what percentage of guns are sold without a background check? Possible White House hopeful’s claim On March 7, 2018, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock -- a possible Democratic contender for president in 2020 -- visited Milwaukee to raise money for Wisconsin Democrats.   Interviewed by WTMJ-TV in Milwaukee, he touched briefly on guns, voicing support for universal background checks and saying: ""It makes no sense that a quarter of our guns are sold outside of the background checks."" So, Bullock’s claim is 25 percent. ‘Zombie’ claim After the Florida school shooting, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., said on NBC’s ""Meet the Press"" that ""40 percent of the guns in this country are sold without any background checks."" But that was wrong. PolitiFact Florida rated his statement False. So did the Washington Post Fact Checker and FactCheck.org. All three agreed, and Sanders’ staff essentially acknowledged, he was using an outdated statistic from a 1994 study. Recent study The fact checks, and experts we contacted, instead cited a study authored by researchers from Northeastern and Harvard universities that was published in January 2017. They did an online survey, in 2015, of 1,613 adult gun owners. Among gun owners who said they obtained their most recent gun within the two previous years:
  22 percent overall said they obtained the guns without a background check. But that includes guns that were purchased or received in another way, such as through a gift or an inheritance. 13 percent who purchased firearms -- for example, from a friend or online -- said they had done so without a background check. The lower figure applies here, given that Bullock’s claim is about gun sales. Our rating Bullock says: ""A quarter of our guns are sold outside of the background checks."" The latest study that surveyed gun owners on the topic found that, among gun owners who had acquired a gun in some way within the previous two years, 22 percent had done so without a background check. That’s close to Bullock’s figure. But it takes into account people who acquired guns either by purchasing them, or by simply receiving them, for example as a gift. Among those surveyed who had purchased a gun within the previous two years, only 13 percent said they had done so without a background check",Mostly False,"March 16, 2018"
"Says ""PTA meetings are now being conducted to help parents tell their kids"" that if a guy with an AR-15 walks into their classroom, ""you are supposed to create as much chaos as you possibly can. They want you to scream and yell and dance around and throw books and just keep moving.""","Potentially fatal guidance for children has been conveyed to parents at PTA meetings while Congress avoids acting against guns used in school shootings, U.S. Senate candidate Beto O’Rourke told voters. At a Feb. 24, 2018, stop in Waco, the El Paso congressman said: ""How"" effed up ""is it that PTA meetings are now being conducted to help parents tell their kids what they are supposed to do when some guy with an AR-15 walks into their classroom – and you know what the message is today for those little third-graders and fourth-graders, and fifth graders – and I’m the father of a fifth-grader, a fourth-grader and a first-grader? The message today is you are supposed to create as much chaos as you possibly can. They want you to scream and yell and dance around and throw books and just keep moving."" O’Rourke went on: ""And when the question is asked, how in the hell is that going to save my 7-year-old, or my 11-year-old, or my 9-year-old, they say, well, it might not, but what it will do is it’ll buy some more time for the other kids in the class. It will take 10 seconds if no one does anything and they’re slaughtered like sheep. It’ll take 20 seconds if there’s movement and activity and chaos in the classroom, and yes, most kids will die, but maybe two or three are able to escape through an open door in the midst of that chaos."" O'Rourke, who subsequently won the Democratic nomination to face Republican Sen. Ted Cruz in November 2018, ranks among House sponsors of legislation to bar the future manufacture, sale or possession of 200-plus firearms including the AR-15 semi-automatic rifle, which was first developed by gunmaker ArmaLite in the 1950s. The AR refers to ArmaLite rifle. As of 2016, there were between 6 million and 10 million of the rifles in U.S. circulation. The NRA refers to the style of weapon as a ""modern sporting rifle."" O’Rourke camp cites Facebook post We inquired into O’Rourke’s basis for saying parents are taught at PTA meetings to coach their kids to create chaos when a shooter walks in. By email, Chris Evans of O’Rourke’s campaign pointed us to a Feb. 14, 2018, Facebook post by Lisa Guthrie, who describes herself on Facebook as a resident of Redmond, a suburb of Seattle, Wash. Guthrie’s post says: ""At a recent PTA meeting, we brought in some of the police officers who work closely with our school district to talk about ALICE, which is their approach to handling active shooter situations."" ALICE stands for Alert, Lockdown, Inform, Counter and Evacuate, a response to campus intruders developed by the Ohio-based ALICE Training Institute. Guthrie’s post continues: ""One part of it is that if the shooter does enter the room where kids are at, the kids are told to run around, yell loudly, throw things like books or wads of paper, etc. Just be a distraction. At first I was like, really? You think a shooter armed with a machine gun is going to confront Samantha armed with a book and just say oh, never mind, I won't kill her? And then it punched me in the gut: If she's face to face with a shooter, she's going to die regardless. The goal will be for her and her classmates to make their deaths take 20 seconds rather than 10. That's 10 more seconds for other kids to run, 10 more seconds for first responders to get to the scene and take out the shooter. A lot of lives can be saved in 10 seconds...

""Just to be clear,"" Guthrie’s post says, ""this is the current state of affairs: We live in a country where kindergartners learn how to maximize the number of lives they can save as they're being massacred."" Institute emphasizes actions to distract classroom intruders We tried to message Guthrie on Facebook and didn’t hear back. But separately Shannon Parthemer, a spokeswoman for the Lake Washington School District, which serves students from Redmond, east of Seattle, confirmed by email that district officials have worked with law officers to train staff and students with ALICE trainings offered to parents ""so they can better understand what ALICE is and how its principles can help increase odds of survival and minimize the loss of life in the event of an aggressive intruder."" Schools hold ALICE drills, Parthemer said, with lessons modified based on kids’ ages. ""For example, young students (like kindergarteners), do ‘listening drills,’"" Parthemer said. ""These drills ask them to listen to the instructions of their teacher for a set period of time. This is a principle that would be important in the event of a true active shooter situation."" At least once a year, she wrote, ""our staff do an ALICE table-top exercise that allows them to talk through an active-shooter situation and determine what actions to take."" Then again, Parthemer wrote, ""these elements are not taught in the manner characterized"" by O’Rourke. Asked to elaborate, Parthemer stressed that the guidance that children distract an intruder comprises only part of the ALICE training. In elementary schools, Parthemer said, students ""are told to listen to their teacher and follow what the teacher asks them to do – lockdown, counter, evacuate, etc."" Parthemer otherwise connected us to Liz Hedreen, president of the Lake Washington PTSA Council, who responded by email that she didn’t attend a meeting like the one described in the Facebook post; the district, Hedreen said, has 41 PTSA chapters ""and each one runs their own meetings, so I don't have specific knowledge about what topics they have covered."" Hedreen said, though, she’d heard a presentation about ALICE training at PTSA meetings at a local high school. Hedreen also pointed out a February 2018 district communication to parents mentioning the ALICE trainings. What the ALICE Institute says The institute says on its website that its training sessions ""increase your children’s and employees’ odds of survival during a violent intruder event. ALICE Training,"" the institute says, ""goes beyond lockdown methods by providing individuals with a new set of skills that will greatly increase their odds of survival during an active shooter situation."" An institute video presents founder Greg Crane, a former police officer, saying that locking down a classroom can be viable strategy when a shooter enters a campus. ""But it can’t be the only response,"" Crane says. ""It is completely inadequate to teach people to only be passive and static when a determined attacker has decided they are his next victims."" Crane elaborates: ""There are no guarantees in life and we cannot guarantee that nobody will be hurt in a planned determined attack. But we do guarantee that by doing something instead of nothing, you will greatly increase the chances of your survival."" Another video shows students and school employees acting out what they’d do if an armed intruder entered their high school. The narrator says that after alerting others via the school’s intercom system, students start to evacuate. Next, a teacher is seen telling students: ""Guys, you need to grab some books. If the intruder walks in, we have to throw them at him."" The narrator says that when an intruder enters the classroom, throwing books and desks and yelling and ""even charging the intruder gives yourself and your students a better chance to survive."" Next, students throw books at a classroom intruder before rushing him and driving him to the floor:                SOURCE: ""ALICE Training,"" ALICE Training Institute, posted to YouTube Oct. 14, 2014 In another video, a teacher reads an institute book for children, ""I’m Not Scared, I’m Prepared!"" In the book, the teacher drills students to follow her directions if a dangerous person enters the school. The teacher says students should look around and pick up something ""easy to throw,"" such as a shoe, a block of wood, TV remote, paperback book, video game ""or even a plastic goat."" The teacher tells students to throw the items at the intruder before running zig-zag out of the school while waving hands and making strange noises. ALICE leader: Training about preparation We separately connected by phone with Crane, who lives in Texas. Nationally, Crane told us, the institute has touched down in every state with 3,700-plus districts having taken ALICE trainings and it wouldn’t surprise him that parents have learned of the institute’s guidance at PTA meetings, perhaps through presentations by local police. ""It’s all about preparation,"" Crane said. ""We have a choice to make. We can teach them to be passive and static or we can teach them to help themselves."" Disrupting or interrupting a shooter, Crane said, drives down his accuracy. ""If I can keep him from accurately targeting me, his miss rate goes up,"" Crane said. Crane noted too that a 2013 federal guide for schools states that if an active shooter enters a school, teachers and administrators have options other than locking down classrooms. The publication states: ""There are three basic options: run, hide, or fight. You can run away from the shooter, seek a secure place where you can hide and/or deny the shooter access, or incapacitate the shooter to survive and protect others from harm."" It goes on: ""As the situation develops, it is possible that students and staff will need to use more than one option. During an active shooter situation, staff will rarely have all of the information they need to make a fully informed decision about which option is best. While they should follow the plan and any instructions given during an incident, often they will have to rely on their own judgment to decide which option will best protect lives."" The guide also says: ""If neither running nor hiding is a safe option, as a last resort when confronted by the shooter, adults in immediate danger should consider trying to disrupt or incapacitate the shooter by using aggressive force and items in their environment, such as fire extinguishers, and chairs."" Texas PTA not pressing for ALICE trainings Crane told us that 20-plus Texas districts have participated in ALICE trainings. Earlier, when we asked the Texas PTA about whether meetings in Texas have talked up the ALICE approach, Kirk Ward, the group’s executive director, replied by email: ""Texas PTA has not organized or given direction for such meetings and trainings."" Our search of the Nexis news database led us to confirm that a Texas district held an ALICE training over two days in August 2017. A June 2017 news story in the Cleburne Times-Review described the Keene district signing up for ALICE training. That story quoted the district’s police chief, Ronny Potts, saying that in an ALICE training he’d attended, he learned that when teachers and students hide underneath their desks, they are ""sitting ducks."" ""With this ALICE training,"" Potts told the newspaper, ""we're wanting to give the kids their own opportunity to make decisions to do what they think is the right thing to do."" We got a phone update from Potts, who told us that by December 2017, employees at every district school had been trained in ALICE and, he said, the district had purchased 100 of the ALICE books intended for young children. ""I’ve never been a big fan of waiting for your demise under a desk,"" Potts said. Disrupting a shooter, he said, weakens his focus. ""What we’re trying to do is increase survivability."" Our ruling O’Rourke said ""PTA meetings are now being conducted to help parents tell their kids"" that if a guy with an AR-15 walks into their classroom, ""you are supposed to create as much chaos as you possibly can. They want you to scream and yell and dance around and throw books and just keep moving.""

"Says Beto O’Rourke wants ""open borders and wants to take our guns.""","Editor's note, Sept. 16, 2019: In response to Cruz’s recent complaint about this 2018 report, we published an explanation of our methodology: We rate statements based on the information known at the time the statement is made. For more detail, read our response.  Republican U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas debuted a song the night of the Texas primaries setting Cruz on course to face Beto O’Rourke on the November 2018 ballot. It’s not a love song. The ditty portrays O’Rourke, a Democrat who represents El Paso in the U.S. House, as a liberal unelectable in Texas; voters there haven’t lifted a Democrat into statewide office since 1994. To the tune of Alabama’s ""If You’re Gonna Play in Texas,"" the singer opens: ""If you’re gonna run in Texas, you can’t be a liberal man."" Cruz's song contains a trio of factual claims. For starters, the singer says O’Rourke started calling himself Beto rather than his given name of Robert to ""fit in."" O’Rourke responded to that sally with a tweet showing a photo of the candidate as a boy wearing a shirt inscribed, ""Beto,"" tracing to his preschool days, O’Rourke told us by phone.                  SOURCE: Tweet, Beto O’Rourke, 1:26 p.m. March 7, 2018 The song's other claims touched off this fact-check: ""Beto wants those open borders/And wants to take our guns."" Without a doubt, we found, O’Rourke has objected to walling off the border and he favors a ban on civilian purchases of what critics call assault weapons including AR-15s, a type of semi-automatic rifle. However, he’s not called for opening the borders or for government agents to take guns from law-abiding residents. Open borders The concept of ""open borders"" drew the PolitiFact Truth-O-Meter initially when Donald Trump in 2016 charged Democrat Hillary Clinton with favoring open borders. Experts said then that making it easier for undocumented immigrants to obtain legal status wasn’t the same as getting rid of enforcement and allowing open borders. But there’s a longer history to ""open borders,"" which the U.S. essentially had for 85 years, the libertarian Cato Institute notes. ""From 1790 to 1875,"" the institute says, any ""immigrant from any country could legally enter, live and work in the United States."" Yet Congress subsequently regulated immigration decade after decade while nowadays, Cato analyst Alex Nowrasteh told us by email, there ""are no members of Congress who support ‘open borders’ or anything that even approaches it."" Edward Alden, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations who authored a 2008 book on federal actions to tighten U.S. borders after 9/11, similarly told us he’s unaware of congressional advocates for opening our borders. ""It’s a derogatory term,"" Alden said by phone, ""that doesn’t have a whole lot of analytical meaning. It’s not even in the conversation in Washington,"" Alden said, where the focus since the 1990s has been on strengthening border security. Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier, asked the basis of Cruz’s ""open borders"" claim, pointed out that O’Rourke, an El Paso native and former member of the El Paso City Council, has been full-throated about opposing the border-long wall promised by President Trump as unlikely to improve security or the flow of trade. Also, she noted, O’Rourke has questioned the worth of existing border barriers. O’Rourke tweets and comments O’Rourke tweeted in January 2017: ""Less than zero. That's the amount of immigration we have from MX. More Mexicans going south than coming to the U.S. Do we need a wall?"" O’Rourke tweeted in April 2017: ""We already have a border wall that we don't need. Don't need more walls and militarization at a time that the border has never been safer."" An accompanying video shows O’Rourke standing in Hidalgo on the Texas-Mexico border and saying fencing there keeps Americans from fully enjoying a U.S. nature preserve. O’Rourke says: ""You tell me if this looks like a war zone or we need to militarize it or if it needs a wall."" O’Rourke told us by phone he doesn’t believe in open orders. Still, he said, ""we don’t need walls. We already have over 600 miles of walls, fencing and physical barriers in place. We don’t need them. They’re not making us safer."" Generally, O’Rourke said, ""it should be easier for people to legally cross the border at ports of entry where they have inspections by a customs officer."" He noted that in alignment with Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, he successfully advocated in 2013-14 for an uptick in customs officers and improvements to ports of entry. Rob Friedlander of O’Rourke’s House office answered our request for detail with emails pointing out matching port of entry infrastructure proposals filed in 2013 by Cornyn and O’Rourke and an omnibus measure signed into law in 2014 including language authorizing the government to enter into cost-sharing agreements at ports of entry and to accept donations toward building, maintaining or altering related infrastructure; the measure also authorized the addition of 2,000 customs agents at a cost of $256 million. O’Rourke’s campaign website We also checked O’Rourke’s campaign website for mentions of open borders. On a web page devoted to immigration, O’Rourke says ""the surest way to improve safety and security is not to build a wall or spend billions more, but to ensure that we are maximizing the potential from everyone in this state, treating each other with respect and dignity."" O’Rourke goes on to list six steps he favors including a ""Dreamer"" law giving residents who entered the U.S. as children paths to permanent legal residency and citizenship. The site includes no call for an open border. City of El Paso resolution From earlier years, Cruz’s camp pointed out a City of El Paso document showing that O’Rourke backed a council resolution objecting to previous federal plans to expand fencing near the border. That 799-word resolution, adopted unanimously in January 2009, says local fencing mandated by the Secure Border Fence Act of 2006 ""will only divide the El Paso/Juarez community and do nothing to advance a comprehensive approach to immigration reform."" The resolution also says ""the complex issues of illegal immigration and a porous border cannot be fixed by an enforcement-only approach. Any solutions must take a multi-layered approach to multi-layered issues created over decades of neglect."" Also, the resolution ""encourages the federal government to re-examine the construction of the fence along the entire southern border."" The resolution doesn’t include a pitch for opening the border entirely. O’Rourke in Congress So, has O’Rourke championed open borders in Congress? Alden noted by email that O’Rourke, who joined the House in 2013, voted that year with colleagues on the House Homeland Security Committee to approve a measure offered by the panel chairman, Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Austin, that included a goal for federal officers to apprehend 90 percent of people crossing the border illegally. We confirmed O’Rourke’s ""aye"" vote from the committee’s May 2013 report to Congress on its approval of the Border Security Results Act of 2013. Also spotted: A post-vote statement in the report, inserted on behalf of committee Democrats, objecting to officials trying to stop all illicit border activity. The statement from Rep. Bennie G. Thompson of Miss. says committee Democrats didn’t share the Republican majority’s view that ""striving to stop 100 percent of all illicit cross-border activity should be the attitude of every (Homeland Security) Department employee with a border security mission."" Thompson’s statement suggests such a focus could weaken security elsewhere: ""Specifically, we are concerned that asking DHS to interdict 100 percent of illicit cross-border activity between the ports of entry would unduly divert limited resources from other border security efforts, potentially undermining our nation's homeland security or economic security. Instead, Democratic members strongly support a comprehensive, risk-based approach to border security that would maximize our enforcement efforts both at and between the ports of entry, while facilitating the legitimate flow of cross-border trade and travel."" Taking guns As far as O’Rourke wanting to  ""take our guns,"" Cruz’s camp pointed out that O’Rourke was among sponsors of an unsuccessful 2015 House proposal, opposed by the NRA, to bar the import, manufacture and sale of ""assault weapons."" More recently, we found, O’Rourke ranks among cosponsors of the 2018 version of the legislation authored by Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I. The 2018 measure would bar the import, manufacture, sale or possession of any semi-automatic weapon--some 205 firearms, Frazier told us by email--or ""large capacity ammunition feeding device."" But the proposal also says the bar wouldn’t apply to any semi-automatic assault weapon or feeding device lawfully held before the act passes into law. O’Rourke told us by phone: ""My intent is for AR-15s not to be sold to the public."" A word: The AR-15 is a derivative of a semi-automatic rifle first developed by gunmaker ArmaLite in the 1950s. The AR refers to ArmaLite rifle, and does not stand for ""assault rifle."" As of 2016, there were between 6 million and 10 million of these semi-automatic rifles in U.S. circulation. The NRA refers to this style of weapon as a ""modern sporting rifle."" To our inquiry, Richard Luchette, a Cicilline aide, noted by email that the O’Rourke-backed proposal exempts from the ban 2,258 ""legitimate hunting and sporting rifles and shotguns that are named by make and model and specifically exempted from the ban. There are a couple other exemptions too – antique weapons, weapons used by the military and law enforcement, weapons owned at the time of the bill’s enactment, and any firearm that is operated by a bolt, pump, lever, or slide action,"" Luchette wrote. We noticed otherwise that the measure authorizes federal funds to be spent on government ""buy-back"" programs for semiautomatic assault weapons and ammunition feeding devices. But we saw no language authorizing or directing officials to take existing guns. Frazier, following up, said by email that removing from availability the weapons named in the legislation adds up to taking guns. ""The people of Texas deserve an explanation from him as to how his support for criminalizing the future sale, transfer and possession of such firearms, does not amount to coming after their guns,"" Frazier wrote. Other analysts For an outside analysis, we turned to Jaclyn Schildkraut, an assistant professor at the State University of New York at Oswego who has studied mass shootings. Schildkraut told us by email that despite the ban legislation lacking language calling for guns to be taken, ""gun rights advocates state that removing any one type of gun is effectively removing all guns."" Whatever the proposal explicitly says, Schildkraut said, it’d be impractical for the government to collect banned guns in part because there’s no federal registry showing who owns such firearms. ""Short of committing a crime or turning one in on your own, there’s no way they’d know you have it,"" Schildkraut said. We also heard back from Joseph Olson, a Mitchell Hamline School of Law professor emeritus and former member of the NRA’s board of directors. By email, Olson agreed the O’Rourke-cosponsored measure doesn’t call for taking guns up front. But, Olson said by email, there’s suspicion among gun-rights’ advocates that once such a proposal starts making its way into law, it’ll be amended by Congress to enable or even require the government to collect guns. Our ruling Cruz says in his song that O’Rourke wants ""open borders and wants to take our guns."" O’Rourke opposes President Trump’s avowed U.S.-Mexico border wall and also maintains that existing fencing he opposed in the first place doesn’t make us safer. But we didn’t spot evidence that O’Rourke wants U.S. borders open without restriction. O’Rourke backs a ban on the future sale and possession of about 200 kinds of guns including AR-15-style rifles. But the legislation he’s cosponsoring doesn’t provide for officials to take any guns held lawfully at the time the measure becomes law",False,"March 15, 2018"
"""Seattle police begin gun confiscations: no laws broken, no warrant, no charges.""","Seattle police seizing a man’s gun under the state’s ""red flag"" law has led to numerous false reports on right-wing websites that police arbitrarily took away a man’s Second Amendment rights. ""Seattle police begin gun confiscations: no laws broken, no warrant, no charges,"" stated a March 7 headline on Liberty Headlines. The story was attributed to Zero Hedge, which used a story from the website SHTFplan that claimed that Seattle police used ""Nazi style gun confiscation."" The same or similar stories have appeared on many right-leaning websites. The Liberty Headlines story said that police seized the man’s gun after neighbors had complained the man had been ""staring"" at people through storefront windows while wearing a holstered firearm. Other residents complained that the man’s open carrying made them feel ""uncomfortable"" and ""unsafe."" The story declared ""tyranny has officially taken hold on American soil"" and that ""a citizen’s Second Amendment rights have been ripped away from him by the government."" Sounds alarming. But it’s not accurate. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. We found that the headline was wrong and that the story failed to explain that police obtained a warrant from a judge after the 31-year-old man failed to turn over his gun and appear at a hearing, as ordered by the court. In 2016, Washington state voters overwhelmingly approved Initiative 1491 to allow courts, upon petition by police or a family or household member, to issue an extreme risk protection order. The order prevents an individual from accessing firearms for a specified time period if the court determines the person poses a significant danger. A handful of other states, including California, have similar ""red flag"" laws, and many other states are considering passing them. Following the Parkland shooting, Florida passed such a law to allow law enforcement to seek a risk protection order. While the NRA argues the laws violate a person’s rights by taking away a gun when no crime has been committed, law enforcement argues it is a tool they can use to take away a gun before a catastrophe occurs. PolitiFact interviewed Sgt. Eric Pisconski, who heads up the unit that oversees extreme risk protection orders, as well as Seattle police spokesman Det. Patrick Michaud. Police did not released the suspect’s name. PolitiFact submitted records requests to the King County prosecutor and obtained the criminal complaint that explains the charge against Alexander Sinclair McKenzie, an Army veteran with post traumatic stress disorder. Police said they had received multiple calls about McKenzie’s escalating behavior in the past year. McKenzie voluntarily surrendered a gun in 2017 after he was served with an anti-harassment order, even though he wasn’t required to do so. He acknowledged he was experiencing ""stress"" and did not want the gun around, Michaud said. Months later, McKenzie, who lives above a restaurant, had several interactions with the restaurant staff. In one instance, he stood in front of the restaurant and yelled obscenities and accused people of talking to him through the floor. ""No crimes were committed at that time, but his behavior was erratic and unnerving to all; resulting in contact"" by police, Michaud said. McKenzie declined services, but shortly thereafter he called police again to report ""taunting and voices"" coming from the restaurant below through the floor. He also told police that he was armed with a gun and wanted a female employee ""arrested or shot"" by police, Michaud said. McKenzie was ultimately taken to a medical facility. On Feb. 13, police petitioned the court to get an extreme risk protection order to take away McKenzie’s gun. A King County Superior Court Judge approved the order and police served it to McKenzie in person at a medical facility. He agreed to call police when he was discharged to hand over the firearm. After he left the medical facility on Feb. 23, police attempted to contact McKenzie multiple times to obtain his firearm. After McKenzie didn’t show up for his Feb. 27 court date about the order to turn over his gun, the judge granted a search warrant based on probable cause to arrest. McKenzie was charged with unlawful possession of a firearm by a person prohibited by extreme risk protection order, a gross misdemeanor. On March 1, police went to McKenzie’s apartment and took his gun. He was placed into custody and booked at the King County jail. The case remains pending. Pisconski said that since the law went into effect in 2017, Seattle police have received 16 extreme risk protection orders that resulted in collecting about 26 guns. This was the only case in which the suspect didn’t voluntarily surrender a gun. One of the websites that wrote that police took the gun without a ""warrant"" added an editor’s note about errors in its original article. The SHFTplan website, which has the tagline ""when it hits the fan, don’t say we didn’t warn you,"" updated the article to state that law enforcement did have a warrant. Liberty Headlines said, ""Seattle police begin gun confiscations: no laws broken, no warrant, no charges."" The headline and the story make it appear that Seattle police arbitrarily took away a man’s gun, and that’s not the case. Interviews with police officials showed that after police received numerous reports about a man’s troubling behavior, so they sought an extreme risk protection order from the court to remove the man’s gun. Police tracked down the man to inform him about the order. When the man failed to appear in court as ordered and didn’t turn over his gun, the judge signed off on the order that allowed police to arrest McKenzie",False,"March 14, 2018"
"Says that during the Supreme Court campaign, Michael Screnock has ""vowed to uphold the platform of the NRA.""","With the Florida school shooting still fresh on many minds, the National Rifle Association became the focus of an attack in the Wisconsin Supreme Court race. The attack came from Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Rebecca Dallet, who is backed by liberals, against Sauk County Circuit Judge Michael Screnock,  who is supported by conservatives. It was made during their televised debate in Milwaukee on March 2, 2018, a month before the April 3, 2018 election for a 10-year term on the high court. Screnock chafed at criticism Dallet made about activities he engaged in before becoming a judge. Then Dallet replied with criticism of his more recent behavior, saying of Screnock: ""I’ll point out some things he’s done during the campaign, like vowed to uphold the platform of the NRA."" Screnock did win the NRA’s endorsement. But did he ""vow to uphold"" the NRA’s platform? NRA queries candidates During the campaign, Screnock hasn’t said whether he believes two major gun rights cases were decided properly. Dallet said she thought the rulings — one by the U.S. Supreme Court, one by the Wisconsin Supreme Court — were made by ""activist"" justices. And while Dallet has backed tighter gun regulations, Screnock has said it isn’t up to courts to determine the best way to curb gun violence. The NRA, well known for fighting restrictions on the right to bear arms, describes itself as ""America’s foremost defender of Second Amendment rights."" Before the Feb. 20, 2018 primary election in the Supreme Court race, the group asked Dallet, Screnock and Madison lawyer Tim Burns, who was eliminated in the primary,  to submit a statement ""stating your positions on Second Amendment issues."" The letter said the NRA would use the responses in rating the candidates, and that the ratings would be communicated to NRA members. Only Screnock responded. NRA endorses Screnock To back Dallet’s attack on Screnock, her campaign cited a mailing the NRA sent to its members before the primary. The mailing, revealed by the liberal advocacy group One Wisconsin Now, urged NRA members to vote for the ""pro-Second Amendment"" Screnock, saying in part: ""Michael Screnock will interpret our Constitution the way our founding fathers intended and has vowed to protect your firearms freedom."" So, there’s the word vowed that Dallet used. But that’s quoting the NRA and not Screnock himself, and it refers to firearms freedom generally, not any particular agenda. Now, to what Screnock actually said. Screnock’s response to the NRA letter  We don’t know, of course, if Screnock had any private contacts with the NRA in connection with the campaign. What is available is his response to the NRA’s request, which Dallet and One Wisconsin Now had been calling on Screnock to release Nearly a week after the primary, Screnock released to the Associated Press the email he sent to the NRA in response to its request for his positions on Second Amendment issues. Key excerpts: I am a Judge, and I have served as an attorney, so I know firsthand the importance of upholding the rule of law, protecting public safety, and respecting the Constitution and the separation of powers. I also know about the dangers of legislating from the bench.

Judges are not legislators, nor are we executives. Our job is to interpret and apply the law, based not on our personal or political beliefs, but by relying on statutes and the Constitution. Simply put, our job is to be arbiters of the law; not policy analysts or political activists. This of course includes the Second Amendment …. Having an independent judiciary comprised of justices with an unwavering commitment to upholding the rule of law, to recognizing and respecting the separation of powers, and to interpreting the Constitution as it was intended is critical to preserving and maintaining our democracy and our republic ….

On a personal note, I am a proud gun owner and enjoy carrying on our passion for the outdoors with my three adult sons. So, while volunteering that he is a proud gun owner, Screnock pledged to uphold the Constitution, including the Second Amendment, rather than to be a political activist. But he didn’t vow to take a position on policies or laws or cases that might be part of a broader NRA platform. In terms of the NRA’s agenda, its most recent calls for action include, while referencing the Florida school shooting, urging members to tell lawmakers to oppose new gun-control proposals, and stating opposition to proposals that would prohibit adults ages 18 to 20 from acquiring rifles and shotguns. Our rating Dallet says that during the Supreme Court campaign, Screnock ""vowed to uphold the platform of the NRA."" Screnock told the NRA his job is to be an arbiter of the law, including the Second Amendment, and not a political activist. But he hasn’t gone so far as to vow to uphold any particular platform",Half True,"March 14, 2018"
"Says Richard Cordray directed an Ohio commission to ""permit an armed group to have a rally on the statehouse grounds, even taking the extraordinary step of assuming personal responsibility for waiving an insurance requirement in the event of an incident.""","In a speech after the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., Dennis Kucinich said fellow Democrat Richard Cordray ran his attorney general’s office as ""an extension of the NRA."" That included Cordray helping a gun rights group hold a rally outside of the statehouse, Kucinich said in a Feb. 27 speech to the City Club in Cleveland. Kucinich has vowed to make guns a key topic as he competes with Democrats, including Cordray, in the May 8 primary for governor. ""One unpublicized official act was a very unusual intervention with the Capitol Square Commission,"" Kucinich said. ""As the commission’s attorney, the attorney general directed it to permit an armed group to have a rally on the statehouse grounds, even taking the extraordinary step of assuming personal responsibility for waiving an insurance requirement in the event of an incident."" Our fact-checking ears perked up with an ""unpublicized official act,"" so we went in search of the facts about Cordray’s actions related to a 2010 gun-rights rally. Kucinich was referring to the Capitol Square Review and Advisory Board, which oversees the statehouse in Columbus. The Attorney General’s office serves as legal counsel to the board. Although he has shown support for some gun control measures after the Parkland shooting, Cordray has had strong support in the past from gun rights groups. Kucinich was talking about a rally organized by Ohioans for Concealed Carry. The event was part of a national wave of marches leading up to the national Second Amendment March in Washington in April 2010. Kucinich’s campaign website linked to a YouTube video clip posted by Progress Ohio, a liberal group, showing about 10 minutes of the April 10, 2010, rally. The clip starts with Dan White, who was active with Ohioans for Concealed Carry, saying: ""I’m not lying, if it wasn’t for them I don’t think we would be on the square right now today. They were instrumental. They did their jobs very well."" Cordray, as attorney general, then followed: ""Thank you, Dan. So as he said, I’m counting on all of you because if there are any troubles it's my responsibility, but I am comfortable with that. I’m pleased to be here today at this Second Amendment rally."" Months later while speaking at an Ohioans for Concealed Carry rally in August 2010, Cordray recounted the difficulties in pulling off the April rally. The Capitol Square Review and Advisory Board was ""very unhappy and resistant"" about the planned rally, Cordray said. ""In the end, after having no real leg to stand on and denying a permit, they decided at the last minute they were going to require some giant insurance policy to have to be obtained for people to be able to have a rally on the statehouse grounds,"" Cordray said. Cordray said he spoke with board chair Richard Finan and asked, ""Look, you don’t require this of other groups, why would you be requiring this here?"" According to Cordray, Finan then asked, ""Are you willing to take responsibility?"" ""And I said, yes, I am willing to take responsibility,"" Cordray told the group. Finan, who has since retired from the board, told PolitiFact that he recalled Cordray reaching out to him before the rally. ""He told us we could go ahead and allow the rally to occur on the statehouse grounds,"" Finan said. We sought records from the board related to the 2010 rally, but a spokesman told us that it only keeps records for four years. However, Jeff Garvas, who organized the 2010 rally and is the president of Ohioans for Concealed Carry, shared with PolitiFact some of his correspondence with the board. Garvas told PolitiFact that his group obtained a permit from the advisory board about eight months before the event. Then, about two weeks before the rally, he said the board told the group that it had to pay for 10 state troopers and promise that no one would show up with a firearm. At some point, the board also told the group that it would have to obtain a half-million dollar insurance policy, he said. (Its special events policy states that the board may require the permit holder to file a certificate of insurance at least seven days prior to the event.) Garvas sent the board’s executive director, William Carleton, a letter raising objections to the firearm ban at the rally. Carleton wrote in an April 10 letter that Garvas had also verbally sought a waiver for the bond requirement and proof of insurance. Carleton granted the waiver as long as the group met certain conditions including holstering firearms and paying $1,000 for five state troopers. Carleton waived the requirement for a bond and proof of insurance. Carleton’s letter doesn’t mention Cordray, but an assistant attorney general was copied on the letter. Cordray’s spokesman Mike Gwin didn’t dispute Kucinich’s statement. Gwin said that the Attorney General’s office ""provided legal advice during the course of the permitting process that denying this group a rally permit would likely result in a costly and successful lawsuit by the protest organizers, as had happened with similar denied permits for statehouse rallies in the past."" Kucinich said Cordray directed an Ohio commission to ""permit an armed group to have a rally on the statehouse grounds, even taking the extraordinary step of assuming personal responsibility for waiving an insurance requirement in the event of an incident."" Kucinich was referring to a rally held in April 2010. A video shows Cordray speaking at the rally where he said ""if there are any troubles it's my responsibility but I am comfortable with that."" Months later, in another video, Cordray said that when the Capitol Square Review and Advisory Board denied a permit and required a ""giant insurance policy"" Cordray spoke with the board’s president and agreed to take responsibility for the event. Finan, the advisory board chair at the time, told PolitiFact that Cordray gave the go-ahead for the rally. Cordray didn’t appear to play the only role in allowing the group to hold the rally. The executive director of the board ultimately granted the waiver after exchanging communications with Ohioans for Concealed Carry",True,"March 13, 2018"
"""The vast majority of crime that is gun related is committed by people who illegally are possessing that firearm.""","U.S. Rep. John Faso says he opposes some gun-control measures because they target the wrong people. Laws that limit the rights of law-abiding gun owners don’t make sense because most gun crime is committed by those who illegally possess a gun, said Faso, a Republican. ""The vast majority of crime that is gun related is committed by people who illegally are possessing that firearm,"" Faso said in an interview on C-SPAN. Faso - who represents parts of the Hudson Valley and Capital Region - supports strengthening background checks for gun buyers, banning bump stocks and raising the age to purchase a firearm to 21. He does not support other measures, like a ban on assault-style firearms. Is Faso right that the majority of gun crime is committed by those who illegally possess a gun? National data The last time the government tracked this kind of data was in 2004 when the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics surveyed inmates in federal and state prisons. Part of the survey asked inmates who had a gun during their crime where they originally got it. Dr. Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, was part of a team that used the data to estimate how many illegally possessed guns. In the 13 states with the fewest restrictions on gun ownership, 40 percent of inmates illegally obtained the gun they used, Webster said. Only about 13 percent purchased the gun from a store or pawn shop. In the other 37 states, including New York state, 60 percent of inmates illegally procured the gun they used, Webster said.   ""If you look at the most stringent standards for legal gun ownership, it’s more like 65 percent,"" Webster said. The data is hard to track because gun ownership laws vary from state to state. New York state has universal background checks, for example. All gun sales have to go through a federally licensed dealer. A state like Mississippi, meanwhile, does not require background checks outside of gun shops. New York state also prohibits people convicted of several violent misdemeanors from buying or owning a gun. Many other states do not, Webster said. ""What people don’t really appreciate is that the standards for gun ownership are so that you can be a legal gun owner but not so much law abiding,"" Webster said. About 48 percent of state prison inmates surveyed said they got the gun they used from a family member, friend, gun store, pawn shop, flea market, or gun show. Most states only require a background check if the purchase happens at a gun store, according to the Giffords Center to Prevent Gun Violence. Forty percent of state prison inmates admitted they obtained the gun illegally on the black market, from a drug dealer, or by stealing it. Federal agencies have not released research similar to Webster’s on illegal gun crime. His study was the only analysis of federal data we could find and experts were not aware of another. Congress since the 1990s has had an effective ban on federal taxpayer money being spent on research into gun violence as a public health issue and gun control advocacy by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But other government agencies are free to collect data on guns and gun crime. Local data Regional studies have found that a higher share of criminals did not legally possess a gun when they committed their crimes. Researchers at the University of Pittsburgh teamed up with the Pittsburgh Police Department in 2016 to look at almost 900 firearms recovered from crime scenes in 2008. They found the criminals connected to these firearms did not legally possess them in 80 percent of the cases. A study from the University of Chicago looked at 99 inmates at the Cook County Jail in Chicago in 2015. It found only about 3 percent of inmates who used a gun bought it at a gun store. Researchers did not track the share of inmates who purchased a gun legally through other means. Previous ruling MSNBC Host Joe Scarborough claimed in 2015 that a very small share of crimes were committed by those who legally possess guns. PolitiFact rated that claim Half True. For that check, we spoke with Philip Cook, a professor of economics and sociology at Duke University. He co-authored the study from the University of Chicago. ""I think it’s safe to say that a low percentage of criminal assaults and robberies are committed with guns that were acquired by legal purchase from a gun store,"" Cook said in 2015. As we noted in 2015, not all guns purchased outside a gun store are illegally obtained. We checked back with Cook for this story. He said the data on violent crimes supports Faso’s claim. ""Most people who commit assault, robbery, or murder with a gun anywhere in the U.S. are disqualified under federal law from being in possession of a gun due to age, criminal record, addiction status, immigration status or other reason,"" Cook said. But there are caveats to the data, experts warned. • Some gun crimes are never solved, so it’s impossible to know whether the gun was obtained illegally. • The national data is more than a decade old. The prison population of 2004 may be different from today’s inmates. • The data also varies between states. An illegal gun sale in one state may be legal in another. Someone can legally sell a gun to their friend without a background check in Mississippi, but not New York. That means Faso’s claim may be true in some states but false in others. Our ruling Faso said ""The vast majority of crime that is gun related is committed by people who illegally are possessing that firearm."" People can differ on what constitutes a ""vast majority."" What's more, illegal gun crime is not well researched in the U.S. The latest data is more than a decade old. One analysis of the data showed Faso’s claim is not true in some states while true in others. But experts say most gun crime is likely committed by those who illegally possess guns. His statement is accurate but needed additional information",True,"March 12, 2018"
"""The Obama administration had cut $300 million from school safety.""","Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, says to prevent school shootings in the future, the country should look to the past. In 2013, Cruz and Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, proposed legislation that Cruz said could have prevented the Feb. 14 Parkland, Fla., shooting. ""One of the things Grassley-Cruz did was increase funding for school safety by $300 million,"" Cruz said on CNN March 7. ""The Obama administration had cut $300 million from school safety. You know, if that had been in place, that might well have meant that another armed police officer could have been in Parkland and could have stopped that killer before he murdered those teenagers."" Cruz’s comment about Obama cutting $300 million from school safety caught our attention. We wondered if Cruz was right. Cruz’s office pointed to Obama's 2010 budget. That year President Barack Obama called for the elimination of the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities State Grants program as part of his budget request. The savings by cutting the program: $294 million. ""President Obama’s 2010 budget zeroed out $294 million in school safety funds,"" Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier said. ""That is a fact."" Congress went along and defunded the program. So that’s about $300 million. But there’s more to this story than just the dollar figure. The particular state grant program Obama and Congress cut was formula-driven, essentially providing guaranteed money to states and school districts. However, in the same budget that eliminated the formula program, Obama requested an additional $100 million for a companion program that handed out grants on a case-by-case basis. Congress ultimately only added $51 million to that, but in any event, the cut Obama sought was closer to $200 million, not $300 million. It is also important to note how that money was spent. The Safe and Drug-Free Schools program had a focus on preventing both drug use and violence. It covered ""health education, early intervention, pupil services, mentoring, rehabilitation referral, and related activities."" William Modzeleski, who headed the program through 2011, told us the program funded a variety of things that went far beyond armed guards or security. ""We were involved in a wide range of activities, ranging from working with the Secret Service on how to identify students on the pathway to violence to one where we spent millions to ensure schools had emergency management plans,"" Modzeleski told us. The program also funded mental health and responses to the H1N1 flu. Obama wasn’t the first president who wanted to end the program. President George W. Bush tried the same thing in his FY 2007 budget proposal. A 2001 study by RAND had said the program’s structure was ""profoundly flawed."" University of New Hampshire researcher Todd DeMitchell told us that Obama’s budget reflected a different strategy. ""The emphasis appears to have shifted to a broader perspective of improving the culture and climate of the school with an increased focus on bullying, health, character and possibly less emphasis on hardening the school site,"" DeMitchell said. Cruz’s statement focuses on one budget decision by the Obama White House in 2010, but doing so ignores what happens in the years that followed. In 2013, after the killings of elementary schoolers and their teachers in Newtown, Conn., Obama rolled out a plan to prevent such slayings from happening again. The package was expansive, including an assault weapon ban and changes to the background check system. But specific to schools, it included $385 million in new spending. It offered ""$150 million to school districts and law enforcement agencies to hire school resource officers, school psychologists, social workers, and counselors."" There were $30 million for schools to design emergency management plans, and $40 million ""to help districts work with law enforcement and other local agencies to coordinate services for students who demonstrate need."" There were at least $75 million aimed at boosting mental health interventions at schools. Like the Safe and Drug-Free Schools program, the proposal covered a lot of ground, but it had more big-ticket line items aimed at violence alone. It is worth comparing Cruz’s plan to put $300 million into school safety. He sought $30 million a year for a decade to pay for more police to protect schools. Obama’s plan called for $4 billion to pay for 15,000 more police officers. Of course, neither plan -- Obama’s nor Cruz’s -- became law. Cruz and Grassley have re-introduced their bill. As a final budget note, Obama ultimately ended the Safe and Drug-Free School program entirely, and folded it into a new program called Successful, Safe, and Healthy Students. Cruz said the Obama administration cut $300 million in school safety money. That fits with the elimination in 2010 of the formula-driven Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities State Grant program. A fuller look at Obama’s proposed 2010 budget puts the cut around $200 million. In addition, Cruz ignores that in 2013, Obama called for $385 million to respond directly to mass shootings in schools, and $4 billion to hire an additional 15,000 police officers. Cruz’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression",Mostly False,"March 9, 2018"
"""Florida is one of only 10 states that totally prohibit a (firearm) registry.""","In the aftermath of the Parkland school shooting, a Florida senator called for the reversal of a key restriction in current law over gun purchases. Florida's ban on a statewide gun registry ""leaves law enforcement in the dark"" as they try to figure out if a threatening person has a weapon or not, said Sen. Perry Thurston, D-Fort Lauderdale. ""Florida is one of only 10 states that totally prohibit a registry,"" Thurston said at Senate Rules Committee meeting where members discussed a school security and gun safety bill.   PolitiFact Florida wanted to look into his statement. Florida law does prohibit a firearm registry, based on Florida Statute 790.335: ""No state governmental agency or local government, special district, or other political subdivision or official, agent, or employee of such state or other governmental entity or any other person, public or private, shall knowingly and willfully keep or cause to be kept any list, record, or registry of privately owned firearms or any list, record, or registry of the owners of those firearms."" The rule was added in 2004 when former Republican Gov. Jeb Bush signed HB 155 into law. Then-Rep. Lindsay Harrington, R-Punta Gorda, sponsored the bill because of concerns from the National Rifle Association, according to a July 2004 St. Petersburg Times (now Tampa Bay Times) article. The story said Harrington was troubled when he heard that law enforcement agencies were collecting data on gun transactions at pawn shops, saying ""I don't think we, in America, want that type of thing."" The law echoes this concern. It says such a registry could ""become an instrument for profiling, harassing, or abusing law-abiding citizens based on their choice to own a firearm."" The statute also says if a registry fell into the wrong hands it could be a ""shopping list"" for criminals. The rollout of the law, however, was a bit shaky the summer after it passed. Spokesmen for law enforcement agencies in Tampa Bay told the Times they had many questions about the broad ban on any ""list, record or registry,"" and said they may need to hire additional workers to go through various paper and electronic records for deletion. The law required agencies to delete electronic data of pawnshop sales within 60 days, which could also make searches for gun information more onerous. ""It's a mess,"" Sherman Smith, the St. Petersburg Police Department's legal adviser, told the Times. ""This has really got me flummoxed."" There are exceptions to the gun records ban. Records can be kept on firearms used in a crime or people who have been convicted of crimes. Aaron Keller, a Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services spokesperson, wrote in an email these records would likely be kept by local law enforcement. Even in cases where firearm records are kept by dealers, those records are prohibited from being compiled into any list by any state employee or private person, according to the statute. So how does Florida’s ban on private firearm records compare to the rest of the country? A Thurston spokeswoman said his information came from the Giffords Law Center. The center, which supports gun restrictions, says seven states, including Florida, prohibit any registry of private firearms. The seven states are Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Rhode Island, South Dakota and Vermont. Pennsylvania prohibits registries of long guns. Only one state, Hawaii, and the District of Columbia require registration of all firearms. Thurston said, ""Florida is one of only 10 states that totally prohibit a registry."" Florida law does explicitly say a registry of firearm purchases cannot be maintained. Thurston was close but not precise about the number of other states that prohibit registries. It’s seven, not 10",Mostly True,"March 8, 2018"
"Florida’s school marshal program passed by the Florida House is the ""first-of-its kind.""","Florida House Speaker Richard Corcoran, R-Land O' Lakes, is following President Donald Trump’s lead by supporting legislation that would arm teachers in the classroom. On The Ingraham Angle on Fox News, Corcoran said that Florida’s proposal to arm teachers, known as a marshal program, is unlike anything else in the country. The voluntary program would train teachers under the direction of local law enforcement. ""One of the things that we are doing in Florida is we have instituted, as President Trump has suggested, the most robust first-of-its-kind marshal program,"" Corcoran said Feb. 27 on Fox News. Corcoran may have spoken too soon, however. The Senate amended the House proposal on March 5 and removed the ability for schools to arm teachers. Instead, school official such as custodians, principals, librarians and counselors would be eligible for training to carry guns. The bill is now moving back to the House. Still, at the time of Corcoran's claim, the House and Senate were considering plans that would include teachers. So, we wondered whether Florida’s proposal was really a ""first of its kind"" like Corcoran said. At the time of Corcoran's claim, the House and Senate proposed school safety packages that established a ""marshal program,"" which would provide training to teachers so they can be armed on school campuses. The program would be optional, and school districts and law enforcement would have to agree to adopt the program. A school employee, who voluntarily enters the program, must get a mental health screening and receive 132 hours of training for firearms safety, firearm precision and discretionary shooting. Corcoran spokesman Fred Piccolo said the one-of-a-kind aspect is the comprehensive nature of the program. ""I think the key word he used is ‘robust,’ "" Piccolo said. ""At 132 hours of required tactical training we have been unable to find a more rigorous system in the country."" According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, at least five states — Georgia, Kansas, South Dakota, Tennessee and Texas — passed legislation allowing school employees to carry firearms at K-12 schools in the aftermath of Sandy Hook. Of those states, the closest plan to Florida’s proposal is in Texas, which has had its own marshal program since 2013. Out of the other four states, Texas requires the most training. South Dakota also has a similar program, just with a different name. In Texas, districts that choose to enter the program select a volunteer — a teacher, a coach, an administrator with the right to carry guns on school campuses. There aren’t solid numbers on the size of the program, since the identities of marshals are anonymous, but Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, a Republican, told Trump that in more than 100 school districts in Texas, teachers and other personnel carry a weapon and are trained to respond to an attack. The Dallas Morning News reported that there has not been any reports of incidents involving marshals at schools. We sent the two pieces of legislation to researchers at the National Conference of State Legislatures to see if there were any major differences between the two programs. ""In my assessment, the programs are not all that different,"" said Jennifer Palmer, a research analyst, National Conference of State Legislatures. ""Both programs are designed to provide additional training for school employees for emergencies including active shooter situations."" That said, there some minor differences that Palmer pointed out, including the amount of training each program requires and where the firearm must be kept. Storage of weapon: Florida marshals can carry firearms concealed in holsters approved by the sheriff. If a marshal in Texas is in ""regular, direct contact"" with students, their firearm must be stored and locked. Training: Texas marshals are required to undergo 80 hours of training, whereas the Florida program would require 132 hours of training. Number of marshals allowed: In Texas, each school can appoint one marshal per 400 students, whereas Florida’s House bill would allow school districts to recommend ""school faculty and staff members"" with no maximum listed. Authority to act: Texas marshals are authorized to make arrests, however only ""as necessary to prevent or abate the commission of an offense that threatens serious bodily injury or death."" Florida marshals are only able to exercise authority with the ""limited purpose of responding to an active assailant incident."" Another similar proposal to Florida’s marshal program is in South Dakota where schools have the option to allow individuals to carry guns in school under the sentinel programs that was established in 2013. State law requires that sentinels be trained for at least 80 hours. The Florida marshal program closely resembles a sheriff-initiated program in Polk County, Fla. According to the Lakeland Ledger, Southeastern University, a private school in Florida, implemented a sentinel program that allows teachers to serve as trained special deputies authorized to carry weapons. Corcoran said the marshal program to arm teachers is the ""first of its kind."" Texas established a very similar program in 2013. South Dakota also has a similar program, just under a different name. Both Texas’ law and Florida’s house proposal have the same goal, which is to provide training to teachers and school employees to carry guns on school campuses.  The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression",Mostly False,"March 6, 2018"
"Says Mike DeWine ""flip-flopped on the gun issue and has earned an F from the NRA.""","Among Ohio’s Republican candidates for governor, Lt. Gov. Mary Taylor portrays herself as more conservative than Attorney General Mike DeWine when it comes to Second Amendment issues. ""I do not trust Mike DeWine on guns,"" Taylor said during a Jan. 29 speech at the Washington Heights Baptist Church. ""He flip-flopped on the gun issue and has earned an F from the NRA. I have an A with the NRA."" Taylor and DeWine are competing in the May 8 Republican primary for governor with hopes to replace term-limited Gov. John Kasich. There is no disputing that DeWine once received an F grade from the NRA, which was based on his stances while in the U.S. Senate more than a decade ago. In 2002, the Columbus Dispatch described DeWine as a ""Republican who's not afraid to stand up to the National Rifle Association."" But when DeWine ran for Ohio attorney general in 2010, his positions on gun laws changed. Taylor omits that DeWine’s grades from pro-gun groups have risen as he has taken stances more in line with the NRA. The NRA did not respond to our requests to confirm DeWine’s grades, but DeWine’s campaign spokesman sent PolitiFact documents showing his grades by the NRA, as well as from a state group, the Buckeye Firearms Association. DeWine has served in elected office since he won a county prosecutor position in 1976. We largely focused our search of his gun stances starting with his tenure in the U.S. Senate from 1995 to 2007. Taylor’s campaign spokesman Michael Duchesne pointed to Vote Smart’s compilation of DeWine’s ratings from groups that take stances on gun laws. The NRA gave DeWine a 46 percent in 2000, an 8 percent in 2006 and an F in 2010. DeWine supported multiple gun control measures while a senator, including restrictions on sales at gun shows and the assault weapons ban. In 1999, DeWine was one of a handful of Republicans to side with Democrats to support an amendment to enact a waiting period on sales at gun shows following the mass shooting at Columbine High School. ""The amendment seemed on balance to make sense,"" he said a year later. ""I feel that the requirement to follow the Brady gun-check law should apply to everyone at a gun show and that's what this amendment did."" In 2001, Dewine co-sponsored a bill with U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., to impose a three-day waiting period on gun show purchases, which was opposed by the NRA. DeWine was outspoken in favor of extending the assault weapons ban. In 2005 when Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., introduced legislation to re-establish the expired ban, DeWine was among a group of bipartisan cosponsors. ""Re-establishing the assault weapons ban is simply good public policy. The law modestly prohibits a select few military-style weapons, all the while protecting the rights of legitimate gun owners nationwide,"" DeWine said. ""As a former prosecutor, I understand the challenges Ohio's mayors and law enforcement officials face, and we owe it to them to reestablish this law."" In 2006, the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence endorsed DeWine in his re-election, according to news reports. DeWine lost to Democratic U.S. Rep. Sherrod Brown that fall. The Columbus Dispatch later wrote, ""DeWine's 2006 defeat was primarily because voters were sick of the war in Iraq, not because they believe everyone in Ohio should own a machine gun."" In 2010 while running for attorney general, DeWine’s campaign told sportsmen and Second Amendment groups that he regretted his assault weapons vote, said Ryan Stubenrauch, who has worked on behalf of DeWine’s campaigns between 2010-18. Stubenrauch said that while DeWine was in the Senate, he heard from law enforcement officials who said they supported the assault weapons ban. But he later concluded the assault weapons ban ""didn’t do anything."" (Firm conclusions about the impact of the ban are not possible, PolitiFact has previously concluded.) In 2010, the NRA still gave DeWine an F. But his support from gun rights groups would change after he was elected attorney general. While attorney general, DeWine repeatedly took stances in favor of gun rights by supporting legislation in Congress and the Ohio Legislature. He also signed on to amicus briefs before the U.S. Supreme Court, including in support of the Illinois State Rifle Association, opposed a federal proposal to ban a certain type of ammunition and supported efforts to arm school teachers. In 2012, DeWine supported the National Right-to-Carry Reciprocity Act to allow any person with a valid state-issued concealed firearm permit to carry the concealed firearm in many other states. He also supported state bills that removed some requirements for concealed carry license holders. When DeWine sought re-election in 2014, the Buckeye Firearms Association gave DeWine a B grade and endorsed him while the NRA gave him a C plus. DeWine’s campaign spokesman said as of Feb. 21 he wasn’t aware of any grade by the NRA for his current race. One other sign of DeWine’s pro-gun stance: He named Secretary of State Jon Husted, who has received an A plus from the NRA, as his running mate. Our rating will only be based on information that was available at the time that Taylor made her statement in January, but we will note that in February the Republicans split endorsements from state gun-rights groups. DeWine was endorsed by the Buckeye Firearms Association, and Taylor was endorsed by Ohioans for Concealed Carry. Taylor said DeWine ""flip-flopped on the gun issue and has earned an F from the NRA."" DeWine did receiving failing grades from the NRA based on his record in the U.S. Senate, including in 2010 when he ran for Ohio Attorney General. As Taylor noted broadly, DeWine did flip-flop. As attorney general he has taken several stances more aligned with the NRA and no longer supports an assault weapons ban. Taylor zeroes in on DeWine’s record from many years ago and omits that by 2014, he had clearly earned the support of the Buckeye Firearms Association when it endorsed his re-election",Mostly True,"March 6, 2018"
"""The US has approximately 5% of the world's population and 42% of civilian gun ownership.""","In the aftermath of the mass shooting at a high school in Florida, politicians and pundits quickly offered facts and figures about guns in the United States. NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch said that in one year, mass public shootings caused more deaths and injuries in France than in the United States throughout the entire Obama administration. (That’s Mostly False.) Bernie Sanders said that ""40 percent of the guns in this country are sold without any background checks."" (That’s False.) In North Carolina, Democratic state Rep. Pricey Harrison of Greensboro recently tweeted statistics that emphasize America’s obsession with guns. ""The US has approximately 5% of the world's population and 42% of civilian gun ownership,"" Harrison tweeted on Feb. 15. She has about 4,000 Twitter followers. She continued: ""We must change the gun culture to gun violence prevention. NC Dems have filed comprehensive gun safety bills repeatedly since the Sandy Hook tragedy w/zero movement."" She’s roughly correct about the United States accounting for 5 percent of the world’s population, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Experts agree that Americans have more guns than citizens of any other country in the world. But, globally speaking, is Harrison right about the United States’ share of gun ownership? 10-year-old stats She cited a story on Vox.com – ""America’s gun problem, explained in 5 facts"" – as the source for her tweet. Vox, for its part, cites a 2007 study by the Switzerland-based Small Arms Survey. ""... in 2007, the number of civilian-owned firearms in the US was 88.8 guns per 100 people, meaning there was almost one privately owned gun per American and more than one per American adult. The world’s second-ranked country was Yemen, a quasi-failed state torn by civil war, where there were 54.8 guns per 100 people,"" the writer, German Lopez, explained. ""Another way of looking at that: Americans make up less than 5 percent of the world’s population yet own roughly 42 percent of all the world’s privately held firearms,"" Lopez wrote. The Switzerland-based group actually offered a less specific estimate. On page 46 of the survey itself, the group estimated that the United States is home to ""roughly 35-50 percent"" of the world’s civilian-owned guns. Lopez, for his part, told PolitiFact that he split the difference in the range. ""It's pretty typical in research to just take the average of a range,"" he said. ""So the range here is 35-50. If you take the average of this, it lands at about 42. That's with a margin of error of about 7.5, obviously, but it's just a shorthand for what the research finds."" The Small Arms Study from 2007 remains the most comprehensive research private gun ownership worldwide, said Adam Lankford, a professor at the University of Alabama and author of the widely-cited study ""Public Mass Shooters and Firearms: A Cross-National Study of 171 Countries,"" published in 2016. The Small Arms Study is an independent research project located at the Graduate Institute of International Studies in Geneva that’s supported by the Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs, as well as donations from other governments. The project compiles data using a ""worldwide network"" of researchers. Lankford agreed with Lopez’s methodology. If you take the survey’s average total of civilian firearms in the U.S. (270 million) and compare that with the survey’s average total globally (645 million), you get 41.8 percent. Guns are hard to track A 2009 National Institute of Justice report found the number of civilian-owned guns in the United States to be about 310 million, but didn't provide comparable global data. Pew Research Center, one of the world’s leading nonpartisan research firms, recently published a study on guns in America that found 42 percent of Americans live in a household with a gun. But the center hasn’t collected data from other countries, ""so we can’t compare our US gun data to the rest of the world,"" spokeswoman Haley Nolan said. Governments don’t track firearms across the board. And many surveys rely on people to self-report guns. ""We only have a rough guess of what there is in the U.S. We have no idea how many guns are in South America,"" said Philip J. Cook, professor of public policy studies at Duke University and co-author of the book ""Gun Violence: The Real Costs.""  South America has a lot of guns that were bought underground, he said. In the ballpark? David Hemenway, professor of health policy at Harvard University and author of the book ""Private Guns, Public Health,"" agreed that global estimates are squishy. ""It’s very, very hard,"" Hemenway said. The best way to estimate the number of firearms in each country would be to have every country track guns that are bought and sold, he said. ""Even then, you only get the legal guns."" That said, he thinks Harrison’s claim is generally accurate compared to other estimates. ""That sort of number is thrown around all the time,"" Hemenway said. ""It’s pretty high validity. This seems to be in the ballpark of the figures I’ve seen."" Our ruling Harrison said that the United States has approximately 5 percent of the world's population and 42 percent of civilian gun ownership. Those numbers are based on a study that’s now 10 years old. And experts say tracking guns is very difficult. But Harrison’s claim is on roughly par with the information available",Mostly True,"March 5, 2018"
Says Delta offers a discount to Planned Parenthood.,"Georgia state Sen. Michael Williams received some on-air fact-checking from CNN when he criticized Delta Air Lines for ending a discount partnership with the National Rifle Association while favoring ""liberal-leaning organizations"" such as Planned Parenthood. Delta ended a discount agreement with the NRA in order to remain ""neutral"" in the national debate over gun control, which resurfaced after a Feb. 14 mass shooting in Florida. ""If they're going to pull the discount for NRA members, why not pull it for Planned Parenthood or some of the left organizations out there?"" Williams, R-Cumming, claimed during a Feb. 27 interview with CNN’s Brianna Keilar. Keilar asked for his source of information to back up Delta discounts for Planned Parenthood. Williams said he and other state senators ""looked it up on Google."" ""Just to be clear, no, we looked it up as well. And it doesn't appear, after some digging, that we have been able to determine that that is actually factual, because you're indicating something that may not be true there,"" Keilar responded. Williams, who’s running to become Georgia’s governor, said he ""very firmly"" believed that Delta ""is out there giving discounts to left-leaning organizations as well."" ""But if you're making that argument,"" Keilar said, ""shouldn't you have your facts straight?"" Like CNN, PolitiFact Georgia found no evidence to support Williams’ claim. Williams’ campaign did not provide evidence to prove it, and Planned Parenthood told us there are no perks, discounts or deals that come with being a Planned Parenthood supporter or member — whether with Delta or any other company. ""There are no corporate perks that come with being a Planned Parenthood supporter or member,"" said Erica Sackin, director of political communications for the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and Planned Parenthood Action Fund. Delta did not respond to our query. Williams and Keilar’s debate continued off-air on Twitter: Keilar asked for backup on the Planned Parenthood claim. Williams tweeted back that his team had responded. Keilar said his statement still did not back up his ""bogus claim."" Williams ultimately tweeted a statement saying Keilar was pushing a ""false narrative."" Williams’ statement mentioned ""Delta's history of supporting left-wing organizations that donate to abortion provider Planned Parenthood."" That’s a few steps removed from what he said in the interview about Planned Parenthood receiving the discount itself. Williams started to backtrack from that in the Keilar interview. Here’s a transcript of the original exchange on CNN: Williams: ""You're telling me that Delta … is not giving away discounts to left-leaning organizations? Is that what you're telling me?"" Keilar: ""No, you told me that it was Planned Parenthood. I'm just talking to you about what you said to me."" Williams: ""I know, but is that not a left-wing organization? ... It is a very left-leaning organization."" Keilar: ""There's no indication they are giving discounts to that organization, is my point."" Williams: ""Again, let's, I guess, agree to disagree, because, again, we cannot -- bring me back on and I will have the information for you about where they're giving away these discounts to (a) left-leaning organization that support(s) Planned Parenthood.""
  So in addition to Williams saying Delta gives discounts to Planned Parenthood, he backs it up to say Delta has ties with left-leaning groups that in turn support Planned Parenthood, which provides abortions. That doesn’t check out either. Williams’ spin that Delta has ties to the Susan. G. Komen Foundation, which supports Planned Parenthood, is also wrong. ""A quick Google search reveals Planned Parenthood receives hundreds of thousands of dollars from Delta partner Susan G. Komen,"" Williams said in his printed statement. ""It's as simple as that. Has Delta cut their ties with the Susan G. Komen Foundation like they did the NRA?"" Andrea Rader, spokeswoman for the breast cancer research organization Susan G. Komen, told PolitiFact Georgia, ""Komen does not and has not had a partnership with Delta at either the state or national level."" Komen does have seven grants in local markets to Planned Parenthood, totaling $277,000, for breast exam services, Rader said. Williams may have conflated Susan G. Komen with the Breast Cancer Research Foundation, an actual Delta partner. The Breast Cancer Research Foundation told PolitiFact Georgia it does not give money to Planned Parenthood. Greg Bluestein, a political reporter for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, tweeted to Williams that Komen said his claim about a Delta partnership is incorrect. Williams tweeted back, ""They may want to issue a new statement"" and included a link to a website for Flashpoint Agency, billed as a marketing agency. Flashpoint Agency’ page has photos of a white and pink plane with a pink ribbon that appears to be Breast Cancer Research Foundation’s logo. ""As part of Delta’s work with the Susan G Komen Foundation Flashpoint was brought in to help launch the ‘Pink Plane’ for Breast Cancer Awareness,"" the website said, incorrectly identifying the partnership. We found a Reddit post where a user wrote ""Delta ends NRA discounts. Keeps relationship with Planned Parenthood."" The user included a screenshot of a Twitter exchange asking Delta, ""Did you end your discount for Planned Parenthood?"" The Delta Twitter account responded, ""Hey Stuart. We don't handle this over Twitter however I will send you the link below where you could find further information. http://bit.ly/2CRW68T  Have a fabulous day. *TLJ"" (Delta sent the user a broken link, which the user noted in a reply.) We asked Delta if it offered discounts to Planned Parenthood but the airline did not respond to that specific question. Delta shared a memo from CEO Ed Bastian to Delta employees regarding the company’s NRA decision and subsequent action by Georgia lawmakers to remove a jet fuel tax exemption from a tax bill that could have saved Delta millions of dollars a year. ""While Delta’s intent was to remain neutral, some elected officials in Georgia tied our decision to a pending jet fuel tax exemption, threatening to eliminate it unless we reversed course,"" Bastian said. ""Our decision was not made for economic gain and our values are not for sale. We are in the process of a review to end group discounts for any group of a politically divisive nature."" Williams said Delta offers a discount to Planned Parenthood. We found no evidence that supports Williams’ claim. Planned Parenthood said its donors and members do not receive any corporate perks from Delta, and Williams failed to show that one exists. Williams’ campaign said that a Planned Parenthood supporter is a Delta partner, but that’s also not true",False,"March 2, 2018"
"""Probably one out of every two households in Oklahoma has a gun.""","One of the least-studied pieces of the gun violence puzzle is how many households own a firearm in each state. There are reasonable estimates at the national and regional levels, but not beyond that. In a recent interview, Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., took a stab at putting a number on ownership in his state. He was talking about being at ease among people with conceal carry permits. ""Probably one out of every two households in Oklahoma has a gun,"" Cole said on MSNBC’s Morning Joe Feb. 28. ""I move in that world every day."" We asked Cole’s staff where he got that ballpark figure and didn’t hear back. There is a federal government survey from 2004 that asked people, ""Are any firearms now kept in or around your home?"" In Oklahoma, 42.9 percent said yes. Nationally, the figure was 31.7 percent. A 2015 article in a peer-reviewed journal, based on a 2013 poll, said that 31.2 percent of Oklahomans reported that they owned a firearm. However, the lead author of the study distanced herself from such a precise estimate. ""Considering that our sample size was modest, please exercise caution,"" said Bindu Kalesan, assistant professor of Medicine and Community Health Science at Boston University. The study was about social gun culture nationally, and ""everything else is secondary or exploratory,"" Kalesan said. Kalesan said so far as she knows, no study has looked at household gun ownership at the state level. The General Social Survey conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago found that in 2014, 43 percent of people in the West South Central region, which includes Oklahoma, Texas, Louisiana and Arkansas, said there was some sort of firearm in their home. Nationally, 31 percent reported the presence of a gun in the home. Cole said half the households in Oklahoma have a gun. In reality, there’s no fresh and reliable data for household gun ownership in the state. A survey from nearly 15 years ago reported that 42 percent of Oklahomans said there was a firearm in their house. A 2014 survey gave an ownership rate of 43 percent of households within a cluster of four states that included Oklahoma. Both the old and the more recent surveys estimated a national ownership rate of about 31 percent. While we can’t say for sure that the older study still holds true for Oklahoma proper, based on its national numbers, it is at least in the same neighborhood as the more recent regional and national estimates. Cole’s figure seems a bit high, but there’s a reasonable chance that the actual number is close to 40 percent",Mostly True,"March 2, 2018"
Says 97 percent of gun owners support universal background checks.,"Students planning a national school walkout, angry that more hasn’t been done to protect them from school shootings, might have more support from adults than they realize when it comes to gun control. The walkouts are planned for March 14, 2018, the one-month anniversary of the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., that left 17 people dead. Speaking about Parkland, U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, who is being challenged by two Republicans in her bid for re-election, made a claim about background checks that might sound extreme. At a WisPolitics event on Feb. 22, 2018, eight days after the shooting, the Wisconsin Democrat said:

We know that we need change. And it’s frustrating because there is a high level of consensus across America on the sort of common-sense safety measures that need to be brought up and passed. Among gun owners -- and I'm a gun owner myself -- 97 percent support expanded, universal background checks so we don’t have the gun-show loophole, so that we don’t have the internet purchases that don’t go through a thorough background check. To reiterate, Baldwin’s claim is about support among gun owners, not just the general public, for requiring background checks for all gun sales, not just those done by federally licensed dealers. Prior fact checks Four months before the Florida school shooting, we rated True a claim by Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele that 90 percent of Americans ""support universal background checks"" for gun purchases. We found a half dozen national polls that showed support at or near 90 percent. And an October 2017 poll taken by Gallup after Abele made his claim found support at 96 percent. But that’s the general public. What about gun owners? Quinnipiac poll To back Baldwin’s claim, her campaign cited a national telephone poll by Quinnipiac University in Hamden, Conn., of 1,249 people who identified themselves as registered voters. The poll, done with live interviews on landlines and cell phones, was taken over four consecutive days, starting Feb. 16, 2018 -- two days after the school shooting in Parkland. The question: ""Do you support or oppose requiring background checks for all gun buyers?"" Before we get to the results, there is one wrinkle here: Respondents weren’t asked if they were gun owners themselves; rather, they were asked if they, or anyone in their home, owns a gun. The result was 97 percent support among gun households (as well as 97 percent among all respondents in the poll). The margin of error for the gun households (which made up 555 of the 1,249 total respondents) was plus or minus 5 percentage points. Three polling experts -- Marquette Law School Poll director Charles Franklin, Karlyn Bowman at the American Enterprise Institute and Janine Parry, director of the Arkansas Poll -- told us they were not aware of any other national polls done in recent months that published results about gun owner support of universal background checks. We did find a poll of people who identified themselves as gun owners, by the Pew Research Center, which asked: ""Would you strongly favor, somewhat favor, somewhat oppose, or strongly oppose making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to
background checks?"" The result: 77 percent of gun owners strongly or somewhat favored. But that poll was taken in March 2017, 11 months before the Parkland shooting. 
It’s tempting to think that support reached 97 percent in the Quinnipiac poll simply because it was taken days after the Parkland shooting. But Quinnipiac’s results have been consistent. For example, support was 94 percent among gun households in Quinnipiac’s December 2017 and November 2017 polls, the most recent ones done before the February 2018 poll. Our rating Baldwin says ""97 percent"" of gun owners support universal background checks.

The figure is correct for the latest national poll, completed days before her claim, that asked about requiring background checks for all gun purchases. The only clarification is that the respondents weren’t all necessarily gun owners, but rather lived in a household where they or someone else own a gun",Mostly True,"March 2, 2018"
"""You take Pulse nightclub. If you had one person in that room that could carry a gun and knew how to use it, it wouldn’t have happened, or certainly to the extent that it did.""","During a televised meeting with lawmakers, President Donald Trump emphasized the importance of firearms as protection against mass shootings in the wake of the Parkland, Fla., school shooting that killed 17. He compared an unarmed group to ""sitting ducks,"" and referred to the June 2016 shooting at an Orlando nightclub. ""You take Pulse nightclub,"" he said Feb. 28. ""If you had one person in that room that could carry a gun and knew how to use it, it wouldn’t have happened, or certainly to the extent that it did."" That didn’t sound right to us, so we did some digging. Turns out, Trump is wrong on how that attack unfolded. On June 12, 2016, 29-year-old Omar Mateen killed 49 people and wounded dozens more in a shooting rampage at Pulse, a gay nightclub in Orlando. Trump ignored the crucial fact that an armed, off-duty police officer in uniform was working security at the club that evening. Soon after the first shots rang out, officer Adam Gruler, a 15-year veteran of the Orlando Police Department, exchanged gunfire with Mateen. This isn’t the first time Trump has made this erroneous claim. Our friends at Factcheck.org flagged a similar statement after candidate Trump at a June 15, 2016 campaign rally — days after the Orlando shooting — bemoaned that there were ""no guns on the other side."" Several days later Trump took to Twitter to clarify his statement after backlash from gun safety advocates and even the National Rifle Association, who said alcohol and guns don't mix.  When I said that if, within the Orlando club, you had some people with guns, I was obviously talking about additional guards or employees ""When I said that if, within the Orlando club, you had some people with guns, I was obviously talking about additional guards or employees,"" Trump tweeted June 20, 2016. Trump’s latest statement on the Pulse shooting gives the impression clubgoers were defenseless, which was not the case. (The White House did not respond to our request for comment.) The Justice Department in 2017 released a nearly 200-page report detailing the Orlando police response to the shooting. Here’s the report’s account of Gruler’s initial confrontation with Mateen: ""Outside, in the Pulse parking lot, (Gruler), who was working extra duty at the club — to provide outside security and to provide assistance to security personnel inside the club if needed — heard the shots that were being fired; at 2:02:17 a.m., he broadcast over the radio, 'Shots fired, shots fired, shots fired,' and requested additional officers to respond. ""The detective told the assessment team that he immediately recognized that his Sig Sauer P226 9mm handgun was no match for the .223 caliber rifle being fired inside the club and moved to a position that afforded him more cover in the parking lot. Two patrons attempted to flee through an emergency exit on the south side of the club. When the detective saw the suspect shoot them, he fired at the suspect."" According to an Orlando Police Department report, additional officers arrived on the scene about a minute after Gruler’s call for backup was broadcast. A second backup officer arrived about a minute after that. At 2:05 a.m., Gruler advised that the suspect had an assault rifle (the gunman also carried a Glock 17 9mm handgun). Gruler again shot at Mateen, this time ""firing three shots at the suspect as the sound of rapid fire gunshots were heard inside the club."" Mateen was ultimately shot and killed in a shootout after law enforcement, including SWAT team members, breached the building's wall. Some 300 local law enforcement officers responded to the scene during the three-hour standoff, according to the Orlando police report. Gruler would later attend Trump’s State of the Union address on Jan. 30 as a guest of Rep. Val Demings, D-Fla. Talking about the Pulse nightclub shooting, Trump said, ""If you had one person in that room that could carry a gun and knew how to use it, it wouldn’t have happened, or certainly to the extent that it did."" An armed, off-duty police officer in uniform was at the club during the shooting, and exchanged gunfire with the shooter, who managed to kill 49 people",False,"March 1, 2018"
"Says Sen. Bill Nelson ""hasn’t done anything on gun safety or school safety, and nothing on gun control.""","Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson criticized Gov. Rick Scott for not appearing at the CNN town hall following the Parkland shooting. ""There is no representative of the state of Florida,"" Nelson said during the Feb. 21 town hall in which Marjory Stoneman Douglas students spoke. ""Our governor did not come here."" Days later at a press conference where Scott announced a proposal for $450 million in school security funding, a reporter asked Scott to respond to Nelson’s criticism. Scott, a Republican, is widely expected to challenge Nelson, a Democrat, in the 2018 elections. ""Bill Nelson is a career politician,"" said Scott. ""He talks a lot. He does nothing. Think about it: He has been in office for almost 50 years. He hasn’t done anything on gun safety or school safety, and nothing on gun control."" That’s a sweepingly broad attack by Scott to claim that Nelson hasn’t done ""anything"" on gun or school safety and mischaracterizes Nelson’s record. We found multiple examples of legislation Nelson supported that related to gun control. Nelson has supported a ban on assault rifles for decades. In 1990 when running for governor, he promised, ""As governor, I will propose a ban on the sale of assault rifles in Florida, as well as a seven-day waiting period on the sale of firearms."" At campaign stops in 1990, Nelson waved a weapon over his head and said that a campaign aide was able to buy a semi-automatic rifle in less than 10 minutes at a Miami gun store. While in Congress in 1990, Nelson cosponsored the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act to make it unlawful for any licensed dealer to sell a handgun to an unlicensed individual unless certain criteria were met. The legislation ultimately passed in 1993 after Nelson left the House. Nelson spokesman Ryan Brown sent PolitiFact a list of more than one dozen bills that Nelson had supported related to gun safety, gun control or school safety. Many were bills he either cosponsored or sponsored or voted in favor of, but many did not become law. Here’s a look at some of the key bills by topic: Assault weapons ban: Nelson has repeatedly supported an assault weapons ban that Congress allowed to expire in 2004. This year, Nelson became one of about two dozen cosponsors of a bill to ban semiautomatic assault weapons and large-capacity magazines that hold more than 10 rounds. The bill has not reached any votes. Bump stocks: Nelson was one of many cosponsors of a 2017 bill to ban bump stocks, an accessory that allows someone to convert a semi-automatic firearm to a nearly fully automatic one. Improving background checks: Nelson sponsored a bill that would require the Justice Department to include in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System information about an individual who is or has been under a federal terrorism investigation. The bill, which Nelson introduced in 2017 after the mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, has not reached any votes. He supported other efforts to strengthen background checks in the past. Denying firearms to terrorists: The ""no fly no buy"" bill would deny the transfer of a firearm if the transferee is known (or appropriately suspected) to be engaged in terrorism. Nelson was one of a few dozen cosponsors. The 2015 bill has not received a vote. Ban certain types of firearms: Nelson sponsored a bill in 2017 to ban firearms that are not detectable by metal detectors if certain components are removed. The bill has not received a vote. He also voted to ban guns with high-capacity magazines holding more than 10 rounds, which failed to pass the Senate in 2013. He also voted for an amendment to require trigger locks and safety devices for handguns in 2004 and to strengthen penalties for the use of so-called cop-killer bullets in 2005 -- both were amendments that passed the Senate. Conceal-carry reciprocity: Nelson voted against legislation that would allow concealed-carry permits issued in one state to be valid in all others that issue such permits in 2009 and 2013. Mental health: Nelson voted for the 21st Century Cures Act, which became law in 2016. The bill stated that the attorney general may provide active-shooter response training to local law enforcement and called for the development of crisis intervention teams to include specialized training for school officials in responding to mental health crises. Nelson was one of about two dozen bipartisan cosponsors of the Excellence in Mental Health Act S. 264, which proposed grants to states to build or modernize community-based mental health services. After the Parkland shooting, Nelson, along with Republican U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio and U.S. Rep. Ted Deutch, D-Boca Raton, wrote a letter to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos urging her department to quickly approve applications from the Broward school district for a Project School Emergency Response to Violence grant. The money could be used for mental health services, overtime for law enforcement and school staff, and costs to operate the school at an alternative site. Nelson has taken some pro-gun votes during his Senate tenure. In 2005, Nelson voted in favor of prohibiting civil lawsuits from being brought against a manufacturer or seller of a firearm. He voted to permit Amtrak passengers to transport guns in checked baggage and to allow individuals to possess firearms in the national parks in 2009. Nelson spokesman Brown said that Nelson is not anti-gun. ""He’s a hunter, he’s owned guns his entire life,"" Brown said. ""He’s never said he wants to ban all guns. He wants to expand background checks and ban semiautomatic assault rifles, like the AR-15.""  
  Response from experts and Scott’s office We sent a list of several of the laws that Nelson supported to Harry Wilson, Roanoke College professor and author of the book Guns, Gun Control, and Elections. We asked Wilson to weigh in about Nelson’s record on guns. ""What kind of alternate universe is this?"" he said. ""The Republican argues that the Democrat is too soft on gun control. Beam me up, Scotty."" ""If one votes for the assault weapons ban and enhanced background checks and against reciprocity, one has clearly voted in favor of stricter gun laws (ask any gun rights group!),"" he said. But Scott does have a point if he wants to argue that some of these bills didn’t pass, so nothing was ""done."" As for Nelson’s pro-gun votes, Wilson said that the Amtrak and national parks votes that were signed by President Barack Obama were not major issues, while the 2005 vote for immunity for gun manufacturers was an important vote that clearly favored gun rights.   ""I would call this a mixed record, but the charge is misleading, at best,"" he said. Everytown for Gun Safety spokesman Andrew Zucker praised Nelson for fighting ""for criminal background checks on every gun sale, opposed arming teachers, and (he) has been an ally in the fight for gun safety for years."" As of 2012 when Nelson was up for re-election, the NRA had given him an F grade. We sent Scott spokesman McKinley Lewis links to several bills that Nelson supported and asked if he had evidence to support the claim that Nelson ""hasn’t done anything on gun safety or school safety, done nothing on gun control."" ""Bill Nelson could not point to any meaningful legislation brought forth and sponsored by him to make it across the finish line,"" Lewis said. ""He’s had nearly 50 years in office, and what has happened? Has he rolled out any bills or legislative packages in the wake of the Parkland shooting?"" Scott said Nelson ""hasn’t done anything on gun safety or school safety, and nothing on gun control."" At least since 1990, Nelson has supported an assault weapons ban. He has also supported several gun control measures including bills to tighten background checks, keep guns out of the hands of terrorists, ban bump stocks as well as firearms that can pass through metal detectors. While many of the bills Nelson supported didn’t become law, it’s an exaggeration to state that he has done ""nothing",False,"February 28, 2018"
"""Under N.Y. State ‘Assault Weapon’ ban 1 simple cosmetic change pictured here is difference between legal & banned""","Sen. Marco Rubio took aim at one provision of a gun law passed in New York state that he suggests can be easily circumvented. The Florida Republican posted a photo of two semi-automatic rifles. Both rifles almost look the same. But one has a pistol grip attached, so it is not legal in New York state, Rubio said. ""Under N.Y. State ‘Assault Weapon’ ban 1 simple cosmetic change pictured here is difference between legal & banned,"" Rubio’s tweet read. Under N.Y. State “Assault Weapon” ban 1 simple cosmetic change pictured here is difference between legal & banned.Otherwise exactly same 1/4 pic.twitter.com/i7CFRkmHvi   The tweet came as Rubio’s response to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who said earlier in the day that Rubio ""should be ashamed of"" himself for not supporting stricter gun control legislation. During a CNN town hall the night before, Rubio signaled support for raising the age to buy a rifle or shotgun to 21 and for tighter background checks for gun purchases. Cuomo supports tougher gun-control measures, like universal background checks and a ban on military-style accessories. New York state already has a ban on some of those accessories. We wanted to know if the one on Rubio’s tweet is on that list. New York state gun laws The accessory shown in the image, called a pistol grip, has been banned on rifles in New York state since 2013. It’s one of several features banned by the New York Secure Ammunition and Firearms Enforcement Act, better known as the SAFE Act. The law, spearheaded by Cuomo, was passed a few weeks after the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School. The law banned so-called assault weapons and created a legal definition for them in New York state. The law defined them broadly as semi-automatic firearms with one or more of the features also banned by the law. There are 10 of those features for rifles. The weapon used by Adam Lanza, the shooter at Sandy Hook, is banned under state law, for example. Lanza used a semi-automatic rifle with a pistol grip and a flash suppressor — two of the features banned under the SAFE Act. But the rifle without a pistol grip pictured in Rubio’s tweet would also be subject to other gun regulations in New York state. First, anyone who wanted to buy the rifle in New York state would have to go through a background check, regardless of who they buy it from. State law would also prohibit any gun owner from attaching a magazine to the rifle that holds more than 10 rounds. Only seven other states have laws that ban large capacity magazines. Florida, where a shooter killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School this month, is not one of them. Our ruling Rubio said with a photo on Twitter that ""1 simple cosmetic change pictured here is difference between legal & banned"" in New York state. That’s true. The pistol grip shown is one of the banned features for rifles under New York state's SAFE Act. The rifle would also be subject to other New York state regulations",True,"February 28, 2018"
"In comparing mass shootings, ""France had a higher casualty rate in one year than the entire two administrations of Barack Obama.""","  With even some Republicans talking about an assault rifle ban, the National Rifle Association has been quick to reject the idea that it might help. On ABC News’ This Week, host George Stephanopoulos suggested that nations with stricter limits see fewer mass shootings. NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch challenged that before Stephanopoulos even fully asked his question. Here’s their Feb. 25 exchange: Stephanopoulos: ""We are the only country that has wide access to these kind of weapons and no one else has the frequency or the intensity of these kind of mass shootings…""

Loesch: ""That’s actually not true.""

Stephanopoulos: ""...mass shooting that we do.""

Loesch: ""That’s actually not true.""

Stephanopoulos: ""That is.""

Loesch: ""France had a higher casualty rate in one year than the entire two administrations of Barack Obama.  And they’re a fifth of our population."" Really? France saw more casualties in a single year than America saw in eight? The NRA press office told us Loesch drew from an analysis by the Crime Prevention Research Center, a group that does research in support of policies favored by gun rights advocates. While Loesch didn’t specify the year, that article compared deaths and injuries in ""mass public shootings"" in France in 2015 with casualties from similar events in the United States between 2009 and 2016. In 2015, France had 150 deaths and 382 injured, for a total of 532. On the American side, between 2009 and 2016, there were 264 deaths, 263 injured for a total of 527. As many will remember, 2015 was a horrific year of terrorist attacks in France. In January, two men who claim allegiance to Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula opened fire in the offices of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. The death toll rose even higherwith a series of attacks on Nov. 13 by a well-organized Islamic State cell in and around the Bataclan Theater in Paris. A total of 132 people died. But 2015 was an aberration for France. The Global Terrorism Database at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism shows that between 2009 and 2014, attacks with guns killed eight people. In 2016, there was one victim. Our French fact-checking colleagues at Liberation found a steady rate of more conventional firearm deaths over the years. (The policy focus is on firearms but it’s important to add that a truck attack killed 86 people celebrating Bastille Day in Nice in 2016.) In contrast, mass shooting attacks in the United States occur regularly, punctuated by particularly horrific events. Loesch’s statistic cherry-picks one bad year and sets it against a more systemic pattern in America. Criminologists and terrorism experts agree that there are significant differences between mass shootings like the one at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida and the Bataclan attacks. The primary distinction is the motivations of the shooters. The motives of teenager Nikolas Cruz in Florida might never be fully understood, but the ISIS cell in Paris had a clear political agenda. The National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism includes an attack in its dataset if the act is ""aimed at attaining a political, economic, religious, or social goal,"" and if  there’s ""an intention to coerce, intimidate, or convey some other message to a larger audience."" Consortium director William Braniff said it’s likely ""that some of the preventative steps we might take to mitigate the likelihood of one kind of violence will be different than for others."" Terrorism researcher Jeff Gruenewald at Indiana University told us that terrorist acts generally take shape differently, giving law enforcement different ways to prevent them. ""Terrorists may plan longer, farther away from their targets, or they may be more likely to communicate with other like-minded individuals and groups through channels that can be intercepted,"" Gruenewald said. ""Terrorist shooters may also choose different forms of symbolic targets than other types of shooters, which has consequences for anti-terrorism measures."" Gruenewald also noted that many state and federal laws explicitly target terrorism, pointing to a broad consensus that such attacks are different from other violent activity. Jaclyn Schildkraut at the State University of New York in Oswego echoed that point. Schildkraut has compiled mass shooting statistics across 11 developed nations in North America and Europe.  She said in the United States, the response to terrorism and the response to mass shootings puts the difference in sharp contrast. ""After 9-11, we saw massive changes in laws and programs,"" Schildkraut said. ""We’ve seen few changes in response to mass shootings."" Schildkraut, however, argued that access to weapons is not a critical matter. Criminals, she said, will find ways to get high-powered firearms. The issue too often in the United States, she said, has been a breakdown in existing control systems that ought to have blocked firearm purchases by shooters. By cross-checking across three datasets, we can separate terrorism and non-terrorism shootings in France and the United States. We worked with the table in the article from the Crime Prevention Research Center, mass shootings in America tracked by Mother Jones magazine, and the Global Terrorism Database. If the Global Terrorism Database included the event, we flagged it in the other two datasets. Segregating those casualties eliminated all but seven casualties in France – four dead and three injured at a Roma encampment in Roye, France. On the American side, that process also flagged the San Bernardino, the Pulse nightclub and the Fort Hood shootings, to mention just few prominent examples. The net effect reduced American deaths to 165 and injuries to 160. We compared domestic mass shootings between the Crime Prevention Research Center table and the Mother Jones database. That comparison showed that the Center included some events that were not in the Mother Jones list, and vice versa. Counting only those events where there were at least four victims killed, the net change was not large – an additional 17 deaths and 17 injuries based on the Mother Jones figures. Counting only non-terrorism events, the numbers appear quite different from the picture Loesch painted. On a non-terrorism basis, both deaths and injuries are about 40 times higher in the United States than in France. Loesch said that in one year, mass public shootings caused more deaths and injuries in France than in the United States throughout the entire Obama administration. Loesch failed to mention that the year she had in mind was 2015, the bloodiest France has seen at the hands of terrorists. So the stat relies on extreme cherry-picking (by Loesch, not the underlying report behind her talking point). Criminologists and terrorism experts gave several reasons why the differences between mass shootings and terrorism matter, and those differences are enshrined in American law and policy. Separating out the terrorism casualties in both countries, the numbers show that mass shootings during the Obama years caused about 40 times more deaths and injuries than in France in 2015",Mostly False,"February 27, 2018"
"""Seventy to 80 percent of NRA members support a universal background check.""","Some lawmakers are pushing for changes to gun laws including universal background checks following the fatal mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. That includes U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, who drew attention after the Las Vegas massacre in October when he announced he would donate to gun control groups roughly $20,000 that the NRA’s political action committee gave him over the years. Ryan received an A grade from the NRA earlier in his career but later broke from the group. ""Seventy to 80 percent of NRA members support a universal background check,"" Ryan said on CNN’s New Day Feb. 20, days after the shooting in South Florida that left 17 people dead. Polls have consistently showed broad support for a universal background check. National polls in 2016 and 2017 found between 84 and 94 percent of respondents supported background checks. But what about NRA members? While federal law requires background checks for sales from federally licensed dealers, unlicensed, private sellers are not required to conduct background checks — although states can create their own laws. Some gun control advocates want a nationwide standard to close loopholes. Ryan’s spokesman cited a 2015 poll of gun owners by Public Policy Polling, a Democratic polling firm, conducted on behalf of two liberal groups: MoveOn.org Civic Action and the Center for American Progress. The poll surveyed 816 gun owners. According to the poll, 24 percent of the respondents identified themselves as NRA members. That means of the total of 816 gun owners, 196 self-identified as NRA members. Of all 816 gun owners, 83 percent responded that they supported a criminal background check for everyone who wants to buy a firearm. For the 196 who said they were NRA members, the poll showed that 72 percent supported background checks. The margin of error for the NRA sample is 7 percentage points, said Jim Williams, an analyst for Public Policy Polling. ""Given that the support for background checks among the NRA subsample is so overwhelming, it’s still far outside the margin of error for that subset,"" he said. We also found an additional poll that included NRA members taking a position on background checks. Pew Research Center conducted a poll of 3,930 U.S. adults, including 1,269 gun owners, in March and April 2017. The unweighted sample size in the survey included 262 respondents who identified as NRA members. The poll included a breakdown of replies from Republican gun owners who were and were not members of the NRA. The poll showed based on weighted data that 52 percent of NRA members favored background checks for private gun sales compared with 75 percent of nonmembers. PolitiFact has previously looked at polls as far back as 2013 that found majority support among NRA members or households where someone was a member of the NRA. For example, a poll done by Johns Hopkins University and conducted online among 2,703 adults — including 169 respondents who identified as a member of the NRA — through GfK Knowledge Networks. The poll found that 74 percent of NRA members supported requiring background checks for all gun sales. (The margin of error was 7 percentage points.) After our 2015 fact-check of a claim related to that poll, NRA spokeswoman Jennifer Baker contacted PolitiFact contending that the poll could not accurately survey NRA members because only the NRA has access to the list of current, dues-paying members. It is common practice in polling to ask respondents to identify whether they are members of, for example, a political party or other group. The NRA didn’t respond for this fact-check. We also previously looked at a poll by Republican pollster Frank Luntz in 2012 commissioned by Mayors Against Illegal Guns, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s group. That poll showed 74 percent of respondents who identified as NRA members favored background checks. The poll included 945 gun owners, half of whom said they were current or lapsed members of the NRA and the others non-NRA members. Janine Parry, director of the Arkansas Poll and a professor at the University of Arkansas, said that the polls do not reflect a large enough sample of NRA members to reach the conclusion that 70 to 80 percent of NRA members support background checks. While it’s tempting to take a national sample and try to drill down, when looking at a smaller subset such as NRA members ""you end up generalizing and that can be dangerous,"" she said. Ideally, a poll would include somewhere between 750 and 1,000 NRA members, she said. ""You would need an independent polling organization to either oversample NRA members or have a big enough national sample to get you to at least 500, but preferably closer to 750 NRA members who can stand as a sample on their own,"" she said. We interviewed some polling experts who said that additional polls would help shed more light on the views of NRA members and that there are caveats about these polls’ methodologies. Polling expert Steven Smith, a professor of social sciences and political science at Washington University in St. Louis, told PolitiFact that the smaller the actual subgroup in the national population, the lower the precision and the larger the margin of error. However, if several polls show a majority of NRA members favor background checks, that increases the confidence in the findings. Some of our polling experts raised some criticisms about methodology. Andrew Smith, director of the University of New Hampshire Polling Center, said he is dubious of any Interactive Voice Response (IVR) polling as the one done by Public Policy Polling. ""They have incredibly low response rates and there is evidence that only the most politically motivated people really want to talk to a computer about their opinions,"" he said. Williams, of Public Policy Polling, defended the methodology and said IVR polling can cut down on social desirability bias — people telling a human questioner the answer they think they are ""supposed"" to say. Ryan said that ""70 to 80 percent of NRA members support a universal background check."" Ryan is citing a poll from Public Policy Polling, conducted in 2015 for liberal groups. That poll found that among the respondents who said they were NRA members, the poll showed that 72 percent supported background checks. Other polls we looked at showed that between 52 and 74 percent of NRA members supported background checks. These polls are imperfect because they include small samples of NRA members, but they all suggest a majority of NRA members support background checks. New polling of larger numbers of NRA members would shed more light on the views of NRA members on background checks",Mostly True,"February 27, 2018"
"""It’s now constitutional to ban [assault weapons] in Illinois. Yet, the Illinois General Assembly has failed to allow other cities to have that opportunity.""","As mayor of north suburban Highland Park, Nancy Rotering has been in the thick of the debate over gun control in recent years. Since 2013, her suburb has prohibited weapons like the semiautomatic rifle used to kill 17 Parkland, Florida, high school students and teachers on Valentine’s Day. The Illinois city’s gun ban has survived a court challenge, with the U.S. Supreme Court in 2015 refusing to hear an appeal of a ruling that upheld the Highland Park law. The practical effect of that decision was to signal other local governments that they could legally impose bans on certain types of military-style guns without violating the Second Amendment. But Rotering, one of eight Democrats vying in the March 20 primary for their party’s nomination for Attorney General, said there’s still a catch in state law that prevents other Illinois towns from following Highland Park’s example. Just days before the Parkland shooting, Rotering told the Sun-Times this: ""We in Highland Park banned assault weapons and were taken to the United States Supreme Court and we prevailed. It’s now constitutional to ban these weapons of war in Illinois. Yet, the Illinois General Assembly has failed to allow other cities to have that opportunity."" Nothing is ever simple when it comes to inevitably bitter disputes over gun restrictions versus gun rights, and that clearly is the case with the fate of assault weapons bans in Illinois. If the Supreme Court says Rotering’s Highland Park can impose a ban, why then does she say that other communities are prevented from doing the same? We decided to take a look. In 2013, Illinois became the last state to allow the concealed carry of guns when the legislature approved it under pressure from a federal appellate court ruling. A few years prior to that the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a blanket handgun ban imposed by Chicago. When it comes to even more lethal firepower, the gun debate can get especially perplexing, with those for or against gun controls often sounding as if they speak different languages. While the term ""assault weapon"" is commonly used to describe firearms used in mass shootings, advocacy organizations like the Illinois State Rifle Association (an affiliate of the National Rifle Association) refuses to refer to semi-automatic rifles that fire a single round each time a trigger is pulled as assault weapons. Nonetheless, ordinances like that in Highland Park that ban semi-automatics often refer to them as assault weapons. Similarly, the package of Illinois laws that allowed concealed carry also included a clause designed to block imposition of piecemeal weapons bans from town to town. ""The regulation of the possession or ownership of assault weapons are exclusive powers and functions of this State,"" the statute reads. It was that language that stripped local governments of their authority to pass their restricting semi-automatic rifles, ammunition magazines and related weapons and devices. ""Local control of certain things are bad,"" said Richard Pearson, executive director of the Illinois State Rifle Association. ""If they want to tax someone to death, I don’t care. They can build roads, but the Second Amendment is a fundamental right."" Two lawmakers instrumental in passing the concealed carry legislation, Sen. Don Harmon, D-Oak Park, and Rep. Lou Lang, D-Skokie, said the local restriction language was the price gun-rights advocates insisted on to reach a compromise. ""There was a constant battle between the pro-gun and gun-safety advocates,"" Lang said in an interview. The measures included a narrow loophole, however. They went into effect July 9, 2013, but gave local governments a 10-day window past that date to pass local assault weapons bans. Highland Park, Chicago, Evanston and Skokie were among the few local governments that took advantage of the opening. Cook County updated an existing ban, effectively extending it to all other suburbs in the county. Two years later, state Sen. Julie Morrison, D-Deerfield, introduced legislation to reinstate power to local governments to pass assault weapons, but it languished in committee and eventually died. Morrison said she is considering another try in the wake of the Florida shooting. Meanwhile, the Illinois House is expected this week to consider several different bills aimed at gun control, including a proposed state licensing system for gun dealers. Rotering says: ""It’s now constitutional to ban these weapons of war in Illinois. Yet, the Illinois General Assembly has failed to allow other cities to have that opportunity."" While there’s much disagreement about how to respond to the problem of gun violence, Illinois’ law on banning powerful rifles, commonly referenced as assault weapons, is clear. Only the state of Illinois — and not local governments — can pass an assault weapons ban, although local governments like Rotering’s Highland Park were granted a narrow and long-since expired window to approve their own bans. Those provisions were included by lawmakers in a 2013 law that allowed the concealed carry of weapons in Illinois. In claiming that the ""Illinois General Assembly has failed"" to reopen the door to local weapons bans, Rotering resorts to language that to some lawmakers seems over the top because she appears to be equating inaction with failure. But the essence of her claim is correct. Lawmakers inclined to back Morrison’s proposal acknowledge it has lacked the votes to pass up to now. Even so, the Legislature has had the opportunity to revisit the issue and did not do so",True,"February 27, 2018"
"We ""have laws on the books designed to prevent people with mental illnesses from getting firearms.""","A week after confessed Florida school shooter Nikolas Cruz -- who had some level of mental health problems -- killed 17 people, President Donald Trump promised tougher mental health screening for gun buyers. Trump’s pledge seemed to contrast with a claim made the day after the shooting by U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan. In his weekly briefing with reporters on Feb. 15, 2018, the Wisconsin Republican said while discussing the Florida case: Remember, we do have laws on the books designed to prevent people with mental illnesses from getting firearms. Ryan alluded primarily to a 1968 federal law. Let’s see what it does. Federal law The federal Gun Control Act was passed following the 1968 assassinations of Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. Among other things, it prohibits anyone ""who has been adjudicated as a mental defective or has been committed to any mental institution"" from possessing a firearm. That’s a small portion of people with mental illness. And it doesn’t account for people who are more likely to be dangerous but don’t meet the threshold of being adjudicated or committed. Here are more specifics from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives: Adjudicated as a mental defective means a court or other lawful authority has determined that a person, as a result of mental illness or other conditions, ""is a danger to himself or others, lacks the capacity"" to manage his own affairs, or ""is found insane by a court in a criminal case."" Committed to a mental institution means a court or another authority has formally sent -- that is, involuntarily committed -- a person to a mental institution. Besides the federal law, Ryan’s office also cited similar state laws on gun possession and mental illness, but the federal law is primary here. Think of a funnel To grasp what the federal law does, picture a funnel. At the top are people with some form of mental illness; at the bottom are the relatively few who are prohibited from possessing a gun. Millions have mental illness: About 45 million U.S. adults live with mental illness, including 10 million who have a serious mental illness, according to the federal National Institute of Mental Health. ""Serious mental illness"" refers to ""a mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder resulting in serious functional impairment, which substantially interferes with or limits one or more major life activities.""   Relatively few are violent: People with mental illness are much more likely to be a victim of a violent crime, not a perpetrator, according to studies. Only 4 percent of violence toward others in American society is attributable to mental illness, according to John Monahan, a professor of law, psychology and psychiatry at the University of Virginia. Few shooters adjudicated/committed: ""The existing body of research on mass shooters suggests that a history of civil commitment or legal adjudication"" -- the standards set by the federal law -- ""is practically unheard of among perpetrators of mass homicide and mass homicide-suicide, according to Gun Violence and Mental Illness, a 2016 book published by the American Psychiatric Association. (Experts told the New York Times -- which noted Cruz was clearly troubled but had no mental diagnosis -- that if Cruz had undergone a full psychiatric evaluation, it might have resulted in a temporary commitment at best, but not full-time institutionalization. One who has studied mass killers said: ""Most of these shooters are angry, antisocial individuals you cannot spot in advance, and even if you could, you don’t have the right to institutionalize them."") Meanwhile, there are issues with the federal law itself. Problems with the law The federal law is both overinclusive and underinclusive, experts told us. Many mentally ill people who are covered by the federal law prohibiting them from having a gun do not pose a danger to others, said Pace University law professor and mental disability law expert Linda Fentiman. At the same time, she said, the law does not cover people who could pose more danger -- such as some schizophrenics who are also substance abusers and have committed violent acts -- if they haven’t been adjudicated or committed. Indeed, many people with more serious conditions go undiagnosed or do not get treatment, much less end up in a legal proceeding over their illness. Fentiman’s points were also made in a law journal article by a New York University law professor and gun law expert James Jacobs, which says: Undoubtedly, court proceedings are never initiated for the majority of dangerously mentally ill individuals … Likewise, a significant percentage of those adjudicated mentally defective or civilly committed are not actually dangerous. A footnote Before we close, a footnote on one gun restriction change, given that it has received references since the Florida school shooting: In February 2017, Trump and Congress rescinded an executive order signed two months earlier by President Barack Obama. It was intended to prohibit an estimated 75,000 people who have mental illness and get Social Security disability benefits from buying guns. The American Civil Liberties Union opposed the order, saying it ""advances and reinforces the harmful stereotype that people with mental disabilities, a vast and diverse group of citizens, are violent."" Our rating Responding to the Florida school shooting, in which the confessed shooter has some history of mental health problems, Ryan said we ""have laws on the books designed to prevent people with mental illnesses from getting firearms."" A federal law, and some state laws, do prohibit people adjudicated as ""mentally defective"" or involuntarily committed to a mental health facility from possessing a gun. But experts say that standard includes people who do not pose a danger to others. And it does not account for a much larger set of people who might be dangerous but have not been diagnosed with, or treated for, a serious mental illness",Half True,"February 26, 2018"
"""A law enforcement officer is more likely to commit a crime than a CWP (concealed weapons permit) holder.""","Florida State Rep. Matt Caldwell, R-North Fort Myers, appeared on CNN to explain why he and his colleagues voted not to consider a bill to ban assault-style weapons after the horrific high school shooting in Parkland, Fla. During the interview, Caldwell drew upon a favored talking point. ""A law enforcement officer is more likely to commit a crime than a CWP (concealed weapons permit) holder,"" Caldwell said Feb. 21. The comment caught our ear and we were curious about the data behind it. We reached out to Caldwell and got no response. His source is most likely number-crunching by John Lott, head of the Crime Prevention Research Center, a group that has written about what it sees as the media’s anti-gun agenda, the need for parishioners to go to church armed, and similar themes. In 2015, Lott compared the rate of crimes committed by police nationwide to permit revocations in Texas, Florida and Michigan. The numbers on police crime came from a national search of news reports by a team at Bowling Green State University. Lott took the national data and compared it to the fraction of permit holders in Texas who had their permits revoked. Lott worked the data several ways and found a substantial gap. ""The rate for police was between 7 to 10 times higher than for permit holders,"" Lott said. But Lott’s work contains one clear counting flaw. His data on crimes by police came from research by Philip Stinson, a criminal justice professor at Bowling Green State University. Stinson told PolitiFact that Lott failed to note that Stimson was reporting the number of cases, not the number of individual officers involved in crimes. ""Some officers are arrested more than once, and some arrested officers have more than one arrest case because of multiple victims,"" Stinson said. ""So, the whole analysis is wrong because the rates are mangled by using a different unit of analysis."" Lott said he doubts that would make a sufficient difference. ""The number of officers committing crimes could be higher or lower, but you’d have to have it be 7 to 10 times lower in order to reverse the ranking."" he said. ""That doesn’t seem very likely."" There’s another counting issue. Two leading researchers questioned Lott’s use of permit revocations to measure crimes by permit holders. ""Those data undercount the true number of infractions,"" said criminologist Richard Rosenfeld at the University of Missouri-St. Louis. ""Think of the process: an infraction occurs, then it must be reported to the police or another legal authority, the police must find it as a crime or infraction that would warrant revocation, and then the revocation must occur."" Rosenfeld said instances fall out of the dataset at each step along the way. Lott agreed that national victimization surveys show that relatively small percentages of crimes get reported, even fewer result in an arrest, and a smaller fraction yet lead to conviction. ""Revocations won’t capture the full number,"" he said. ""I don’t know how to compare that pattern to police crimes because there are no matching survey data for police. Lott said he believes that police would be less likely than the average permit holder to be caught in a crime, but that is more theory than proven trend. Law professor and statistical analyst John Donohue at Stanford University gave another reason to doubt the link between revocations and crime. In his research, he found a ""number of cases where the permit holder was killed while committing a crime and of course those permits are not revoked."" Donohue added that much research shows that when the number of police rises, crime goes down. Caldwell said that a law enforcement officer is more likely to commit a crime than a concealed weapon permit holder. That is based on shaky numbers. The article behind Caldwell’s statement treated the number of criminal cases involving officers as if it were equal to the number of officers themselves. According to the researcher that looked at those crimes by police, that ""mangled"" the crime rates of officers. A single officer could be named in many cases. On the flip side of the ledger, other researchers said that using permit revocations undercounts the number of crimes by permit holders. The analyst behind the Caldwell’s statement agreed that it is an imperfect measure. In short, the statement rests on dicey numbers. Those numbers point to the need for more research, but they don’t prove anything",False,"February 23, 2018"
"""Mass shootings went up 200 percent in the decade after the assault weapons ban expired.""","Rep. Ted Deutch, D-Fla., claimed mass shootings increased substantially after an assault weapons ban expired in 2004. The Democratic lawmaker represents the Parkland, Fla., community, where on Valentine’s Day a 19-year-old man killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Authorities say the gunman who’s been charged with 17 counts of premeditated murder used an AR-15 rifle. ""Let's be clear, mass shootings went up 200 percent in the decade after the assault weapons ban expired,"" Deutch said during a Feb. 21 CNN town hall with survivors of the mass shooting. We’ve fact-checked several claims about gun control since the shooting and wondered if this one was true. At least one researcher found a significant increase in mass shootings since the assault weapons ban expired. But overall, experts caution against pegging an increase solely to the ban’s expiration, and told us Deutch’s claim is based on a flawed analysis. A federal law from 1994 to 2004 banned the manufacture of 19 military-style assault weapons, assault weapons with specific combat features, ""copy-cat"" models, and certain high-capacity ammunition magazines of more than 10 rounds. Congress did not renew the ban once it expired in September 2004. What happened next? Advocates on both sides of the gun debate often point to the same report assessing the ban published in 2004 for the U.S. Justice Department. One key takeaway: The report said it was premature to make a definitive conclusion about the ban’s impact. It said there had been mixed results in reducing criminal use of the banned guns and magazines. If the ban were to be renewed, it might reduce the number of gunshot victims, but the effect would likely be ""small at best and possibly too small for reliable measurement,"" the report said. If the ban lapsed, the report said, it would be possible for new assault weapons to be used in mass murders. Former President Bill Clinton made a similar point as Deutch in 2013 when he said, ""Half of all mass killings in the United States have occurred since the assault weapons ban expired in 2005, half of all of them in the history of the country."" The Washington Post Fact Checker awarded the claim Three Pinocchios. The fact-check found that Clinton was exaggerating research from Grant Duwe, director of research and evaluation at the Minnesota Department of Corrections. Why is that relevant? Deutch’s office cited commentary posted on The Century Foundation, a left-leaning think tank, as support for his statement about a 200 percent increase in mass shootings. The commentary criticizes the Fact Checker article for missing the big picture behind Clinton’s point. Part of the Century Foundation commentary said: ""If we look from September 2004 all the way back to 1900 (104 years), as the Washington Post lays out, there were 118 mass shootings. That breaks down to 1.13 mass shooting incidents per year, on average, from 1900 to 2004. In the eight years since the assault weapons ban has expired, there have been 28 mass shooting events. That equals an average of 3.5 a year — an increase of over 200 percent."" But several experts, including Duwe, pointed out flaws in that examination and consequently, in Deutch’s relay of that information. ""This claim is, at best, very misleading for a few reasons,"" Duwe told PolitiFact Florida in an interview. For starters, to arrive at a 200 percent increase, the claim actually has to go back to 1900, and not the decade after the ban’s expiration that Deutch cited. ""The assault weapons ban was only in effect from 1994 to 2004, and that is the relevant period to compare with the period after 2004 if one is making a claim about the impact of the assault weapons ban,"" said Gary Kleck, David J. Bordua emeritus professor of criminology and criminal justice at Florida State University. It’s also important to factor in population size changes, experts said. In an October piece for Politico, Duwe noted that ""since the mid 2000s, the incidence of mass public shootings on a per capita basis has been a bit higher than it was in the preceding 10 years."" But the rates over the past 10 years were not higher than in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Duwe said. ""If you have more shootings after the ban but also have a larger population, then when the numerator and denominator are increasing, the outcome number stays the same,"" said Jaclyn Schildkraut, an expert on mass shootings research and an assistant professor of public justice at the State University of New York at Oswego. Nonetheless, mass public shootings have become deadlier over the last decade, as the number of victims shot and killed has increased since the expiration of the assault weapons ban, Duwe said. It’s also worth noting that there isn’t an universally accepted definition for mass shootings. Deutch’s office said their definition for mass shooting involved an individual with a firearm who targets four or more victims with intent to kill, not including the perpetrator. Duwe defined mass public shooting more narrowly as any incident in which four or more victims are killed with a gun within a 24-hour period at a public location in the absence of other criminal activity (robberies, drug deals, gang ""turf wars""), military conflict or collective violence. Louis Klarevas, who teaches at the University of Massachusetts-Boston and has also written about mass shootings, told us his research generally supports Deutch's claim. Klarevas examined incidents before, during and after the assault weapons ban when six or more people were shot and killed. • 1984 to 1994: 19 incidents • 1994 to 2004 (ban is in effect): 12 incidents • 2004 to 2014: 34 incidents That shows a 183 percent increase of incidents in the decade after the ban, compared to the years during the ban. However, several experts also cautioned against concluding that an increase in mass shootings would be solely tied to the expiration of the assault weapons ban. A critical question in the assessment of the assault weapons ban would be how often assault weapons, however defined, were used in mass shootings, said Gregory Koger, a professor of political science at the University of Miami. ""I do not expect the effect of a ban to be instantaneous, nor to end when the ban ends,"" Koger said. ""If there are a certain number of assault weapons in circulation when the ban goes into effect and these weapons are removed from circulation over time (say, if they are destroyed, become ineffective, or are seized by the police), then the effect of a sales ban increases over time."" If gun manufacturers find a way around the ban, its effects decrease over time, Koger said, adding that once a ban is lifted, ""its effects may linger to the extent that it decreased the supply of assault weapons in circulation."" Among other factors also worth considering is media coverage of mass shooters, which Adam Lankford, a criminology professor at the University of Alabama, said rewards perpetrators with fame and can lead to copycat effects. ""Although firearms availability is the primary reason why the United States has more public mass shooters than other countries, media coverage of perpetrators may largely explain why the United States has seen more public mass shooters and deadlier incidents over time,"" Lankford said. Deutch said, ""Mass shootings went up 200 percent in the decade after the assault weapons ban expired."" Researchers of mass shootings told us the analysis Deutch relied on is flawed because it did not adjust for population changes and used irrelevant data points for comparison. Trends in the incidence and severity of mass public shootings on a per capita basis also show that the rate per 100 million is similar now to that of the 1980s and early 1990s, an expert told us. A separate analysis found an 183 percent increase in mass shootings where six or more people were killed in the decade after the ban, compared with the 10-year ban period. But experts caution against inferring that an increase is due only to the ban’s expiration. Deutch’s claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression",Mostly False,"February 23, 2018"
"""So many of these shooters turn out to be communist Democrats.""","Leave it to lawmakers and pundits to ascribe political motivations to people who may have none. It didn’t take long after the shooting at a Parkland, Florida, high school for politicians and pundits to speculate on whether the suspect was left- or right-leaning. CNN’s Van Jones retweeted an account that suggested most mass shooters are Republicans. Meanwhile, a state legislator in North Carolina claimed on Facebook that most shooters are ""communist Democrats,"" and a Congresswoman from New York made a similar claim. (Read about her claim here.) In NC, state Rep. Larry Pittman, a Republican state House member from Cabarrus County, near Charlotte, was reacting to a photo on Facebook that purported to show the Parkland shooter wearing a pro-Communism shirt. (It was not the Parkland shooter.) ""So many of these shooters turn out to be communist Democrats, that I suspect they are doing these things to push for gun control so they can more easily take over the country,"" Pittman wrote. The post was later deleted and he apologized. There’s a lot we do know about the people who conduct mass shootings. For instance, they’re mostly white men. They’re usually young. And some have a history of mental illness. As for their political affiliation? Here’s what we found. Mass shooters since Columbine There is no universal definition for mass shootings. We looked at 19 shootings that have received significant national media coverage since the Columbine High School shooting in 1999. More than eight people were killed in each of the shootings. We found very few cases in which the political affiliation of the shooter could be verified. Omar Mateen, the shooter who killed 49 people at a nightclub in Orlando, Florida, in 2016, was registered as a Democrat in 2006. He voted in the Florida primary in 2016, according to reporting from Politico. A dating profile for Chris Harper-Mercer, who killed nine people at a community college in Oregon in 2015, said he was a Republican, according to reporting from CBS News. There was no evidence of his political affiliation beyond the profile. A friend of Aaron Alexis, who killed 12 people at the Washington Navy Yard in 2013, said in a CNN interview that the shooter was ""more of a liberal type."" There were no other reports of his political affiliation. Politicians were the victims of a couple of recent shooting rampages that weren’t on our list of 19 mass shootings. In 2017, 66-year-old James Thomas Hodgkinson shot and injured six people at a congressional baseball game in Virginia — nearly killing House Majority Whip Steve Scalise. Hodgkinson volunteered for the presidential campaign of Democrat Bernie Sanders and apparently targeted the Republican team. In 2011, 22-year-old Jared Lee Loughner opened fire in Tucson at an event hosted by Rep. Gabby Giffords, an Arizona Democrat. Loughner killed six and injured 13 others, including Giffords. Authorities reported that he was obsessed with Giffords. Inaccurate reporting There was speculation about the political leanings of some of the other shooters. ABC News falsely reported that James Holmes, who killed 12 people in Colorado in 2012, was a member of the conservative Tea Party. ABC apologized for the error. Breitbart News reported that Holmes may have been a registered Democrat, but also walked back that claim. Holmes’ political affiliation was never verified. Fake news websites claimed Devin Patrick Kelley, who killed 26 people in a Texas church last year, was linked to anti-fascist groups. PolitiFact debunked that claim. Websites made the same claim about Las Vegas shooter Stephen Craig Paddock. We debunked that, too. Paddock wasn’t registered to vote and his family said he didn’t have strong political views, according to a report from Fox News. There were also claims that Adam Lanza, who killed 20 people at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012, was a Democrat. He was not registered to vote, according to the Washington Post. Most recently, our friends at Snopes debunked the claim that Nikolas Cruz, who allegedly killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida, was a Democrat. A search of Florida’s voter database yielded no results for Cruz’s party affiliation. There was no reporting on the political leanings of the other 11 shooters. Is it relevant?  Mass shooters are rarely motivated by a political agenda, experts told us. Mass shootings are often perpetrated by young men who are socially isolated or have a mental illness, experience a trauma or conflict that sends them reeling emotionally, and have easy access to guns, said Alan Lipman, professor at George Washington University Medical Center and founder of the Center for the Study of Violence. ""Their motives are almost always, without exception, nonpolitical. And they don’t describe themselves as having a particular political motivation,"" Lipman said. Some — like Dylann Roof, who killed nine people at a church in Charleston, S.C., in 2015 — might channel their rage at a specific group of people, said James Alan Fox, criminologist at Northeastern University and author of ""Extreme Killing: Understanding Serial and Mass Murder."" But that doesn’t mean they’re acting on a Republican or Democratic mission, he said. ""Very few are motivated by any sort of political agenda in terms in parties. They might be anti-gay or anti-black or anti-white. You could argue those are political, I guess,"" he said. Even then, those beliefs are often born out of personal vendettas — not political propaganda, said Katherine Ramsland, professor of psychology at DeSales University. ""Look at Stephen Paddock. We don't know his motive,"" Ramsland said in an email, referring to the Las Vegas shooter. ""Devin Kelly — his political affiliation is secondary to his family disputes and need for payback. I just think it's overly simplistic to align a mass shooter's influence with a political ideology unless it's clear from the shooter that this was his (or her) driving issue."" Other experts reacted similarly to the assertion that shooters tend to have common political beliefs. ""Most of the school shooters are children who wouldn’t know a conservative from a communist,"" said Jack Levin, Northeastern professor and co-director of the Brudnick Center on Violence and Conflict. ""The idea of associating politics with these mass murders is absurd. It has absolutely nothing to do with it."" Lipman agreed: ""There is absolutely no evidence to show that mass killings are motivated by political ideologies of any type. All of the mass killings we’ve seen have been motivated by a lethal combination of a small subgroup of mental illnesses, and easy accessibility to weapons of mass killing during the peak symptomatology of those illnesses.""

"""So many of these people that commit the mass murders end up being Democrats.""","An upstate New York member of Congress made national headlines when she suggested many mass shooters were Democrats. Rep. Claudia Tenney, R-Utica, was speaking with a radio host from Albany, N.Y., about how to prevent future mass shootings when she made the claim. ""It's interesting that so many of these people that commit the mass murders end up being Democrats, but the media doesn't talk about that either,"" Tenney said on Feb. 21, 2018. The host of the radio show did not ask Tenney to back up her claim, but several reporters on Twitter did. Her office sent out a statement from Tenney that evening: ""I am fed up with the media and liberals attempting to politicize tragedies and demonize law-abiding gun owners and conservative Americans every time there is a horrible tragedy,"" Tenney said in the statement. ""While we know the perpetrators of these atrocities have a wide variety of political views, my comments are in response to a question about the failure to prosecute illegal gun crime. I will continue to stand up for law-abiding citizens who are smeared by anti-gun liberal elitists."" Tenney did not answer questions about her claim at a press event the next day. Her office has not provided any support for the claim. (A lawmaker in North Carolina made a similar claim this week as well. Read more about that here.) We wondered if there was any truth to Tenney’s claim. Do many mass shooters turn out to be Democrats? There is no universal definition for mass shootings.

""Our banks, our airports, our NBA games, our NFL games, our office buildings, our movie stars, our politicians — they are all more protected than our children at school,"" Lapierre said at the Conservative Political Action Committee Feb. 22. ""To stop a bad guy with a gun, it takes a good guy with a gun."" LaPierre had barely stepped down from the stage when the advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety tweeted this blast from LaPierre’s past. #tbt to Wayne LaPierre in 1999. #CPAC pic.twitter.com/oVfq3VR9zs The group quoted LaPierre as saying in 1999, ""We believe in absolutely gun-free, zero-tolerance, totally safe schools.That means no guns in America’s schools. Period."" There are a few angles to consider here. Did LaPierre say those words? Yes, he did. It was May 1, 1999, 10 days after two teenage boys killed 13 people, wounded more than 20 others and then committed suicide at Columbine High School in Colorado. LaPierre spoke at the NRA’s annual convention and called for a policy banning guns from school. But LaPierre said more than what the Everytown group quoted. He was talking about guns brought to school by students, not teachers or trained security. ""Of the 6,000 young people the president acknowledges were caught with a gun at school during the past two years, we believe all of them should have been prosecuted,"" LaPierre said. ""But the truth is only five were prosecuted in 1997. And just eight were prosecuted in 1988. That's not zero tolerance."" LaPierre made a passing reference to armed guards in schools, referring to ""the rare exception of law enforcement officers or trained security personnel."" As for arming teachers, something President Donald Trump has shown a keen interest in, LaPierre said nothing. In his 1999 speech, his emphasis was on what adults should do to keep weapons out of the hands of teens. LaPierre said the NRA held adults responsible. ""Just as every kid should have a guardian who knows where he is and keeps him safe, every firearm should have a guardian who knows where it is and keeps it safely stored,"" LaPierre said. Columbine horrified the nation in its scale and the cold-blooded method of the high school seniors who had spent a year planning their attack. The Senate passed a bill to strengthen background checks, but it died in the House. The slaughter prompted more discussion of early identification of loners, and more emphasis on school security. Keeping weapons out of the hands of minors gained more attention. The 2012 shootings in Newtown, Conn., that took the lives of 26 elementary students and one of their teachers was the signature event when LaPierre spoke forcefully about a good guy with a gun being the best response to a bad guy with a gun. His rhetoric in 2012 was the same as when he spoke in 2018. ""American airports, office buildings, power plants, courthouses, even sports stadiums are all protected by armed security,"" LaPierre said at a news conference Dec. 21, 2012. ""Yet, when it comes to our most beloved, innocent, and vulnerable members of the American family, our children, we as a society leave them every day utterly defenseless."" In 2012, LaPierre called on Congress to immediately ""appropriate whatever is necessary to put armed police officers in every single school in this nation."" Everytown for Gun Safety tweeted the reminder that nearly two decades ago, LaPierre said, ""We believe in absolutely gun-free, zero-tolerance, totally safe schools. That means no guns in America’s schools. Period."" The quotation is accurate, but it takes LaPierre’s words out of context. His full message was that adults should keep weapons out of the hands of minors and that schools and localities should act swiftly to punish any student caught bringing a firearm to school. In 1999, LaPierre also left open the door for armed security on school grounds, but that was not the focus of the policy debate at the time. That option has since risen on the NRA’s agenda. The Everytown tweet has a measure of truth, but it leaves out important context that changes the meaning behind LaPierre’s words",Half True,"February 23, 2018"
"""Here in Florida, despite 14 school shootings in eight years, we still have some of the weakest gun laws in the nation.""","In the wake of the Parkland, Fla. shooting, Democratic candidate for governor Philip Levine released a TV ad promoting tighter gun restrictions and documenting an alarming number of school shootings in the state. Levine, the former mayor for Miami Beach released the 30-second ad after the Feb. 14 Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting that killed 17 people. Levine will face several other Democratic challengers in the primary on Aug. 28. ""When we send our children off to school, we want to know they're safe,"" Levine says as he steps off a school bus. ""But here in Florida, despite 14 school shootings in eight years, we still have some of the weakest gun laws in the nation."" Have there really been 14 school shootings in Florida since 2010, and does Florida have some of the weakest gun laws in the nation? There isn’t one uniform way to track school shootings in the United States. Methodologies and definitions vary with each group collecting data, offering a range of numbers on the prevalence of school shootings in recent years. To back up Levine’s claim, spokesman Christian Ulvert sent PolitiFact Florida a list of 14 events that he described as school shootings. Ulvert said he compiled the list after vetting news articles about shootings. Wikipedia also lists 14 school shootings in Florida over the past eight years. Ulvert also sent along a tweet from WFTV investigative and political reporter Christopher Heath who reiterated the statistic. The list indeed includes 14 incidents in the last eight years (actually since 2012). But the descriptions and circumstances of many of the events are quite different than what occurred in Parkland. Date Location Details March 6, 2012 Episcopal School of Jacksonville Shane Schumerth, a Spanish teacher who had been fired, went to the Episcopal School of Jacksonville armed with an AK-47. Schumerth shot and killed the Head of the School, Dale Regan. Schumerth then killed himself in the office. Jan. 7, 2013 Apostolic Revival Center Christian School, Fort Myers, Florida Kristopher Smith, 27, was killed by gunshots fired at the school. Police believed it to be a retaliation killing, possibly for speaking with police about a previous event. A news report does not mention who killed Smith, including if that person was a student. March 18, 2013 University of Central Florida James Oliver Seevakumaran, 30-year-old student, pulled a fire alarm at the Tower One dormitory to attract a crowd. After threatening to shoot his roommate; he released the roommate, who ran out and called 9-1-1. Seevakumaran then fatally shot himself in the head. Oct. 4, 2013 Outside Agape Christian Academy A 16-year-old student was shot in the hip outside of the academy after a fight broke out. An innocent bystander was hit by a stray bullet or shrapnel. Two victims were treated for minor injuries. Dec. 4, 2013 Near a soccer field on the campus of West Orange High School A 17-year-old student shot and injured a 15-year-old student near a soccer field on campus. Jan. 30, 2014 Parking lot of Eastern Florida State College A student and two others were fighting in a parking lot when the student pulled out a gun and shot one of the men in the chest.   March 12, 2014 Behind the Academy of Knowledge Preschool An elementary school teacher was shot and killed by her husband. Sept. 9, 2014 Parking lot of Stellar Leadership Academy in northwest Miami-Dade After a fight broke out, someone fired a gun. One person was injured. Nov. 20, 2014 Near the Strozier Library at Florida State University A gunman opened fire on FSU’s campus, leaving three students injured before he was killed by campus police. Nov. 20, 2014 Miami Carol City High School Two teenagers were shot during a fight. One boy died. Jan. 16, 2015 Parking lot of Vanguard High School in Ocala, Fla. A gunman opened fired in the parking lot, injuring one 14-year-old girl and a 19-year-old woman. (Woman was cut by glass) Feb. 23, 2015 Music building at Bethune-Cookman University Two students were arguing and one pulled out a gun. Three students were injured. May 12, 2015 Jacksonville (a school bus on 118th Street) A 16-year-old student was accused of firing five bullets at a school bus. Two students were injured. Feb. 14, 2018 Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting A 19-year-old former student began shooting students and staff members with a semi-automatic rifle, killing 17 people and leaving 14 more injured. So there are 14 documented incidents in which a gun was fired inside a school or on or near school property since 2012. Of those shootings shootings: Seven involved no deaths; Four occurred during a fight between specific people or students; Three of the seven incidents that resulted in deaths did not involve students; One was an incident between a wife and her husband. We presented the list from Levine’s office to Jaclyn Schildkraut, an assistant professor in the Department of Public Justice at the State University of New York at Oswego. Schildkraut said she only considered two of the incidents ""school shootings"" — the Feb. 14 shooting at Stoneman Douglas and the Nov. 20, 2014, shooting at Florida State University. She said the shooters at Stoneman Douglas and FSU had similar motivations, unlike the other incidents on the list that happened after or during an altercation.    ""He goes into a place that he knows is populated and randomly starts shooting,"" she said. ""It’s not targeted violence like the fights and the case where a woman was shot by her husband."" To back this point up, Ulvert sent PolitiFact Florida a link to an NBC News article that cited a 2016 report from the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, a group that supports more restrictive gun regulation. Florida does have weak gun laws based on this analysis, but saying it has some of the weakest requires context. According to the report, Florida received an F for its gun laws, the lowest grade a state can receive. But so did 24 other states. Grades are assigned based on how many ""points"" a state earns. The more points, the better the grade. For example, states can earn points if they require a background check for every firearm sale and lose points for laws that allow people to carry concealed, loaded guns in public without a permit, among other things. In a news release, Giffords Law Center also notes that in 2016 Florida had ""the nation’s 26th highest gun death rate … and was ranked the 26th worst state for firearm laws."" Giffords said Mississippi received the worst score in 2016. While Mississippi received an F last year, its ranking dropped from 49 to 50 because it enacted a law that allows people to carry hidden, loaded guns in public without a license. Following the shooting, Giffords Law wrote a news brief pointing out some of Florida’s permissive laws, which included the state’s pre-emption law that sought to prevent local governments from passing new gun restrictions on their own. The organization claims the law was ""designed to severely restrict local authority to regulate firearms."" It also said that Florida’s ""stand your ground"" law was amended recently to make it ""even more dangerous."" Levine said that ""despite 14 school shootings in eight years (in Florida), we still have some of the weakest gun laws in the nation."" Levine can count 14 instances in the past eight years where guns were discharged on school grounds. But describing those 14 instances as school shootings is misleading, an expert told us, particularly when compared with, and in the context of, the shooting in Parkland. A group that supports tighter gun restrictions, meanwhile, says that Florida does have weak gun laws. But two dozen states share that same description",Mostly False,"February 23, 2018"
"""Gov. Rick Scott made it illegal for a doctor to ask a patient if they owned a gun, even a mental health professional. This law was so dangerous that a court had to strike it down.""","A TV ad airing in the wake of the Parkland, Fla., school shooting targets Florida Gov. Rick Scott over his support for a controversial gun measure. The ad was produced by Giffords, an organization that fights gun violence and is named for former Arizona U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. Giffords was shot in the head in 2011. The ad references three recent Florida shootings, in Parkland, Orlando and Fort Lauderdale, and then goes after Scott. ""We need to stop dangerous people from getting guns. But Gov. Rick Scott made it illegal for a doctor to ask a patient if they owned a gun, even a mental health professional. This law was so dangerous that a court had to strike it down."" Does the ad cast Scott’s position, and the reaction of the court, correctly? We decided to find out. The law behind the ad, ‘docs vs. glocks’ In 2011, Florida lawmakers crafted a bill to strengthen patient protection related to firearms after hearing a report of a woman in Central Florida who was turned away from her pediatrician. The bill said that health care providers couldn’t ask questions to patients or their families about whether they own a gun, unless the provider ""believes that this information is relevant to the patient's medical care or safety, or the safety of others."" It also stated that health care providers couldn’t discriminate against patients because they own firearms. The penalties included facing fines up to $10,000 or loss of a medical license. The bill passed the House and Senate, with a few Democrats joining in with Republicans to support the plan. Scott signed the bill into law on June 2, 2011. The ad correctly says the law applied to a ""mental health professional"" because Florida law defines health care practitioners as including those who are licensed to provide psychological, clinical, counseling, and psychotherapy services. But did the law make it illegal for a doctor to ask a patient if they owned a gun? The 2011 law didn’t expressly state that doctors couldn’t ask patients if they owned a gun. But it did limit their ability to do so by stating that providers ""should refrain from making a written inquiry or asking questions concerning the ownership of a firearm"" unless in ""good faith"" they believe ""that this information is relevant to the patient's medical care or safety, or the safety of others, may make such a verbal or written inquiry."" The law failed to detail what would qualify as meeting that standard. Critics say it created a chilling effect for doctors who stopped asking questions out of fear they would face discipline. After nearly six years of litigation, in February 2017 the 11th Circuit Federal Appeals Court ruled that some provisions of the law were unconstitutional, including the part that prevented providers from asking patients about guns. The bill’s ""record-keeping and inquiry provisions prevent doctors and medical professionals from asking all patients, or all patients with children, whether they own firearms or have firearms in their homes, or from recording answers to such questions."" A medical professional, for example, would violate the law ""if he or she gives all new patients an intake questionnaire which asks about firearms in the home,"" the court wrote. The ruling addressed the danger of the law in a few ways. First, the court addressed the danger of doctors facing a ""credible threat of prosecution."" The court wrote that when the alleged danger of legislation is self-censorship harm, ""can be realized even without an actual prosecution."" Second, the court concluded that the legislation did not provide a means by which patients could hear from their doctors about firearms and firearm safety. In the fields of medicine and public health ""information can save lives"" and doctors, therefore, ""must be able to speak frankly and openly to patients,"" the court wrote. The court wrote that some medical organizations believe that unsecured firearms increase risks of injuries and are a leading cause of death for some age groups. That’s why major medical groups ""recommend that doctors and pediatricians routinely ask patients about firearm ownership, and educate them about the dangers posed to children by firearms that are not safely secured."" Thomas Julin, a First Amendment lawyer who represented a coalition of medical groups as ""friends of the court,"" told PolitiFact that the court was not attempting to determine whether the law was so dangerous that it had to strike it down. ""It was trying to determine whether the state had sufficient evidence to show that the law would advance the interests that it supposedly had been enacted to serve,"" he wrote.   However, the law did create a danger that health care providers would censor their own speech -- which they did do to avoid possible discipline. ""When one speaks of the law being dangerous, I think most people would understand that to mean not simply that it created a danger of self-censorship, but that the law deterred health care providers from providing advice to patients that would be used to prevent firearm accidents,"" Julin said.  ""I think that is a fair characterization of what the law likely did because it apparently did deter health care providers not only from making inquiries of their patients but also from providing advice to their patients regarding the dangers of firearms and ammunition ownership and how that could be mitigated.""      We asked Scott’s press office if he had any evidence to refute the claims in the ad, but his spokeswoman did not directly answer our question and said that Scott was ""focused on finding real solutions to keep students safe."" Scott showed support when the Legislature passed the bills. ""I look forward to seeing those bills,"" Scott said in April 2011. ""I believe in the right to bear arms."" A Giffords TV ad said, ""Gov. Rick Scott made it illegal for a doctor to ask a patient if they owned a gun, even a mental health professional. This law was so dangerous that a court had to strike it down."" Scott didn’t act alone -- he signed the law after the Legislature passed it in 2011. The bill didn’t flat out prevent doctors from asking patients if they owned a gun, but said they should refrain from asking about guns unless they believed in good faith the information was relevant to the patient’s medical care or safety. That was a vague standard, which effectively silenced some doctors, critics claimed. A federal appeals court ruled in 2017 that the inquiry provisions prevented medical professionals from asking questions about firearms. The ruling also stated that doctors faced the threat of discipline and doctors must be able to speak openly with patients to provide life-saving information",Mostly True,"February 22, 2018"
"In most states, you can buy an assault rifle with no proof of ID, but in every state, you need proof of ID to vote.","After a teenage gunman killed 17 people at a high school in Parkland, Fla., Americans of all political persuasions flocked to social media to express their views on gun policy. On the pro-gun control side of the argument, Areva Martin, an author and TV commentator, tweeted a graphic that showed in most of the country, it is harder to vote than it is to buy an assault rifle. She shared the following graphic with the comment, ""Just let this sink in! #FloridaSchoolShooting #Florida #GunReformNow."" Just let this sink in! #FloridaSchoolShooting #Florida #GunReformNow pic.twitter.com/h5EvrgDwsY However, a closer look at both gun policy and election law suggest some important caveats that the graphic leaves out. (Martin did not reply to an inquiry from her representative.) Unlike many viral images we see, this one provided its sourcing. It cited an article by Alex Seitz-Wald in Salon.com and the liberal Center for American Progress. The chart was put together from elements of the Salon article by Adam Peck, an editor with the website ThinkProgress, which is affiliated with the Center for American Progress. Peck told PolitiFact that the graphic was originally created to be embedded in a separate Think Progress article. The accompanying ThinkProgress article ""was our opportunity to provide readers with the kind of information and nuance that simply don't work in a visual capacity,"" Peck said. ""Obviously, the pitfall is that those graphics can be easily divorced from their companion articles, losing whatever nuance we set out to provide."" Also important to note: The Salon article, the ThinkProgress article and the graphic were all published in 2013. (Seitz-Wald has been at NBC News since 2014.) So the underlying data is five years old. The meme’s re-emergence means there’s been a game of telephone, with notable context falling by the wayside. Student survivors of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School gather at the capitol in Tallahassee, Fla., on Feb. 21, 2018. (AP/Mark Wallheiser) You wouldn’t know it from the graphic, but whether an ID is required for a gun sale depends on who is making the sale. Under federal law, federally licensed gun dealers, importers and manufacturers must run background checks for sales to an unlicensed buyer. Specifically, a potential purchaser must show identification, complete a federal document known as a Form 4473, and pass a National Instant Criminal Background Check System check. Where the meme has a point is that in the states that didn’t pass a tougher law, unlicensed private sellers are exempted from having to complete the background check process. Commonly, such unlicensed sellers operate from gun shows or flea markets, although a licensed dealer selling from a show would have to run the background check. ""For anyone who thinks he or she might not pass a background check, or is looking to circumvent any waiting period, they can bypass both in a majority of states,"" said Peck, the graphic's creator. As Seitz-Wald noted in his article, states can add their own restrictions on top of these requirements. At the time the article was written, only about a third had done so. Since then, Oregon and Washington have begun requiring background checks (and thus an ID) on all gun sales, including private transfers. This distinction — between the rules for licensed sellers and for unlicensed sellers — didn’t make it into the meme. That matters. While it is possible in many states to buy a firearm without an ID by seeking out an unlicensed seller, such purchases account for a fraction of all sales. Gun shops and other types of brick-and-mortar stores — where background checks are required — account for a majority of purchases. A research paper published last year in the Annals of Internal Medicine found that of the 70 percent of gun transfers studied that were purchases — as opposed to gifts and inheritances — 53 percent were purchased from stores and 17 percent were purchased from family, friends, online or gun shows. Those percentages have increased over time. In the past two years, 64 percent were purchased at stores. In other words, it’s certainly possible to purchase a gun without an ID in many states, but in reality, a large majority of purchases are done with IDs and background checks. The graphic is more problematic on the point that in no state can you vote without proof of ID. It’s certainly true that a number of states have requirements for voters to hand over a government-issued photo ID in one of just a few categories, such as driver’s licenses. The strictest of these include Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Mississippi, Tennessee, Virginia and Wisconsin, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Other states also have ID requirements to vote, but in many cases, they allow easier-to-obtain paperwork, including documents without a photograph in some cases. Some of the valid documents, depending on the state, include student ID cards, utility bills, bank statements, paychecks, government checks, Medicare or Medicaid cards, employer ID cards, or a bank or debit card. Finally, there are 16 states that do not currently require documents at polling booths at all. They are California, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Vermont and Wyoming. So the notion that every state requires an ID to vote is incorrect. If the graphic had said that an ID is required to register to vote, it would have been somewhat more accurate. Under the federal Help America Vote Act, every state must request identification when registering first-time voters who did not register in person and did not provide identification when filling out the mail-in registration form. For these voters, a wide variety of documents are accepted for registration; many states allow some of the non-photo IDs cited above to serve that purpose. The viral image said that in most states, you can buy an assault rifle with no proof of ID, but in every state, you need proof of ID to vote. It is indeed possible to buy an assault rifle without an ID if you go to a gun show — but the graphic neglects to mention that these sales are the exception rather than the rule. A significant majority of gun purchases are made in transactions that require ID and a background check. As for the voting claim, some states have imposed strict photo ID laws at the voting booth. However, the graphic ignores that about one-third of states require no ID at all to vote, and that many of those that do require identification allow a range of documents to serve that purpose, including student IDs, utility bills and debit cards",Mostly False,"February 22, 2018"
Say David Hogg is a crisis actor.,"Multiple internet bloggers are falsely accusing David Hogg, a student survivor of the deadly shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., of being a paid actor with a past of pushing for additional restrictions on guns. The conspiracy theories spread to the mainstream when Benjamin Kelly, an aide for Florida state Rep. Shawn Harrison, R-Tampa, told a reporter that Hogg and another student were ""actors"" who ""travel to various crisis (sic) when they happen."" Here's the email. I asked for more information to back up the claim and was sent another email that linked to a YouTube conspiracy video. pic.twitter.com/VRSVOcjj3E The aide was fired, and the Broward County School District said Hogg and his classmate are ""absolutely students at Stoneman Douglas."" Here are the facts. Conspiracy theorists have latched on to a CBS news video of Hogg in Los Angeles from 2017 as evidence that the teen might be a plant. Hogg posted a video that showed an argument between his friend and a lifeguard on Redondo Beach. The argument was unrelated to guns. After Hogg’s friend put a boogie board on a trash can on the beach, a lifeguard asked him to remove it. The friend complied with the lifeguard's request, but the interaction turned sour after the friend made a snide remark. Hogg’s video of the dispute went viral. CBS later interviewed Hogg about the dispute and the video. From there, websites like the conspiracy-minded Infowars reached for straws, including Hogg’s appearance after the shooting on CBS This Morning. ""Interestingly, Hogg has reconnected with CBS for an appearance on CBS This Morning as the mainstream media unabashedly features high school students as figureheads for a new anti-gun push,"" InfoWars wrote in a blog. Folks on the internet took the claim one step further and claimed that the video was proof that Hogg was just pretending to be a high school student in a different state. At one point, the No. 1 trending video on YouTube was a video suggesting that Hogg was an actor, but the video has since been removed.  Hogg says he was visiting California, which is corroborated by his personal Twitter account.   ""I love going to LA for the summer,"" he tweeted August 5, 2017. I love going to LA for the summer pic.twitter.com/C2x5L3jbBB Shortly after, on Aug. 10, 2017, Hogg posted a short vlog (video blog) on YouTube about his experience in California. And finally, The Eagle Eye, Marjory Stoneman Douglas' newsmagazine, published a story about his vacation and viral video. Some social media users took the claim further and said that Hogg actually graduated from Redondo Shores High School in California. But evidence that supported those theories — like a supposed yearbook photo of Hogg in California — was debunked by fellow Stoneman Douglas High students on Twitter. One student, Sarah Chadwick, said that the images of Hogg allegedly pictured in a California yearbook were really from Stoneman High. ""She claims it’s not a Douglas yearbook (which I promise it is, I know multiple people in that picture) yet there’s someone in the pic wearing a douglas t-shirt????"" Chadwick tweeted.

""There’s a photo going around claiming David Hogg did not attend Douglas, but a school in California. Here’s a video to debunk that:"" tweeted Joey Wong. There’s a photo going around claiming David Hogg did not attend Douglas, but a school in California.

Those theories are unfounded. Conspiracy-minded websites are claiming Stoneman Douglas High students are crisis actors hired to stir up controversy. Not only is there no credible evidence to support this claim, plenty of evidence contradicts it entirely. The school district has confirmed that the targeted students are, in fact, students.

"""Forty percent of the guns in this country are sold without any background checks.""","Like many other politicians before him, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., repeated a false claim that 40 percent of guns are sold without a background checks. ""We have to end the absurdity of the gun show loophole,"" Sanders said Feb. 18 on NBC’s Meet the Press. ""Forty percent of the guns in this country are sold without any background checks."" Three years after we first debunked this statistic, it’s still not true. The statistic comes from a 20-year-old study by the National Institute of Justice that looked at gun owners’ responses to a 1994 national survey asking how they got their weapons. The study found that 30 percent to 40 percent of all gun transactions were made through an ""off-the-books"" transfer in which a background check wasn’t required. The finding has been cited widely by gun control advocates. Former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe earned a Mostly False when he used it, and a Florida gun control advocate earned a False in 2017 after the finding was diminished by new research. The latest research suggests the percentage is almost half of what Sanders cited. The sample size of the 1997 study was very small, with just 251 participants. Furthermore, the statistic stems from survey data that included firearms given as gifts or inheritances, not just sales. This is an important point. When the authors of the NIJ study — Jens Ludwig of the University of Chicago and Philip Cook of Duke University — adjusted the results to include only the guns sold (not given), the number sold without background checks declined to between 14 percent and 22 percent. That statistic more closely resembles the new findings in a relatively new 2017 study. Researchers Matthew Miller, Lisa Hepburn, and Deborah Azrael published a study in the January 2017 edition of the journal Annals of Internal Medicine that was specifically undertaken to update the 1994 data. The researchers asked 1,613 adult gun owners where and when they acquired their last firearm, including whether it was purchased, and whether they had either a background check or were asked to show a firearm license or permit. The answer: 22 percent obtained their gun without a background check. That’s about half of the 40 percent figure that has gained wide currency for more than two decades. In fact, Cook wrote an accompanying editorial in the journal, headlined, ""At last, a good estimate of the magnitude of the private-sale loophole for firearms."" In it, he wrote, ""Even though I bear some credit (or blame) for the earlier estimate, I could not be more pleased to be done with it, given that it is based on data from a survey done more than 20 years ago and that, in any event, never directly asked participants about background checks."" ""It appears the number he cited may be outdated,"" Sanders spokesman Josh Miller-Lewis told PolitiFact Florida in an email. ""But whether it’s 40 percent or 22 percent of guns being acquired without a background check, millions of Americans still obtain guns without background checks. That's absurd. No one should be allowed to purchase a gun without a vigorous background check."" Sanders said, ""Forty percent of the guns in this country are sold without any background checks."" That statistic is outdated. It stems from  a 20-year-old survey that has been overtaken by another study that shows that 22 percent of gun buyers obtained their weapons without background checks. That’s just over half the percentage in the zombie claim Sanders cited",False,"February 20, 2018"

Hard numbers on the number of guns in the United States are also elusive. In the past few years, headlines in the Washington Post and on Vox have declared there are more guns than people in the United States. Both noted a surge of gun sales following the 2008 election of President Barack Obama. But the headlines suggest the figures are certain when they’re not, given that there is no record keeping that would produce an actual count of guns in the United States. As the Pew Research Center has observed: ""Gun ownership is one of the hardest things for researchers to pin down."" At the same time, there have been studies to produce estimates on the number of civilian guns in the nation. Both the Post and Vox noted an estimate on the high end -- 310 million guns -- that was cited in a 2012 report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. The report said the estimate was based on U.S. Department of Justice data and was the ""total number of firearms available to civilians"" as of 2009. That 310 million count is higher than the U.S. population in 2009 of about 305 million. But one gun-statistics expert, Philip Cook at Duke University, told the Post that the actual figure then was probably closer to 245 million guns, not 310 million, to take into account circumstances such as guns that break down or are lost or destroyed. And Cook and two other experts -- Tom Smith at the University of Chicago and Daniel Webster at the Johns Hopkins at the Center for Gun Policy and Research -- told us the best, most recent estimate is in a study published in October 2017 by researchers from the Harvard Injury Control Research Center. A total of 3,949 adults, representative of the U.S. population, were surveyed online. The lead author of that study, Deborah Azrael, told us the respondents were asked if they owned guns and how many, and were instructed not to count BB guns, replicas or other guns that were not functioning. ""There are clearly guns we miss,"" Azrael said, noting that some people might lie about owning guns. ""My guess is we probably miss more than we undercount."" The estimate: 265 million civilian guns in the United States, as of when the survey was taken, in January 2015. Meanwhile, the U.S. population at that time, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, was about 320 million. Other highlights of the Harvard study: Of the estimated 265 million total civilian guns, 113 million were handguns. The typical gun owner (the median, in the survey) owned two guns. 39 percent of the estimated 265 million guns were owned by 8 percent of the gun owners -- that 8 percent of all owners owned 10 or more guns.

"""3 American women are murdered every day by their husband or boyfriend.""","The resignation of two White House aides accused of physically abusing their wives has shone a brighter spotlight on the scourge of domestic violence.   President Trump, who initially praised the work of one of the aides and wished him well, said one week after that he is ""totally opposed to domestic violence."" Meanwhile, California Rep. Jackie Speier, a Democrat who represents the San Francisco area, weighed in through Twitter with an alarming statement: ""3 American women are murdered every day by their husband or boyfriend.""   Domestic violence plagues all corners of the United States, no matter a community’s political leanings, economic status or demographic make-up. Still, we wanted to know whether the congresswoman’s provocative claim was accurate and what source of information she relied on. We set out to fact check Speier’s sad statistic. Our research Rep. Speier, a survivor of gun violence, has been a strong voice for gun control and for stopping sexual assaults. Her spokeswoman pointed us to an NBC news article which says ""nearly three women are murdered every day in the U.S. by current or former romantic partners."" That’s slightly different from the congresswoman’s tweet, which did not specify former partners. But it’s fairly close. The NBC article cited data from a 2017 Violence Policy Center report called When Men Murder Women. Representatives at the policy center could not be reached for comment. After examining the report, we found it somewhat supports Speier’s statement, with a few caveats. It analyzed 2015 homicide data collected by the FBI. It found 928 female homicide victims were ""wives or intimate acquaintances of their killers."" That works out to 2.54 female victims killed by an intimate partner on average per day in the United States. While Speier stated ""women,"" ages were not specified in the report. The report, which is the most complete and current we could find, indicates the assailants were not just husbands or boyfriends, but also ex-spouses and former boyfriends. Common claim Several domestic violence prevention groups have cited the same ""three women murdered"" figure on their websites. At least two of these, the National Organization for Women and the American Psychological Association, cited data that’s a decade or more older from the Bureau of Justice Statistics, an office at the U.S. Department of Justice. The National Organization for Women, for example, cited federal statistics from 2005 that show, on average, about 3.2 women were killed per day by an intimate partner in the United States. Shari Miles-Cohen, senior director of the Women’s Programs Office at the American Psychological Association, said the statistic dates to a 2003 Bureau of Justice Statistics report, but also matches with more recent homicide findings, including from 2013. Missing data We found a note of caution in a 2013 Bureau of Justice Statistics report on female homicides by intimate partners. It warned that the relationship between the killer and homicide victim was unknown for anywhere from a quarter to a third of the homicides in any given year. That’s because an offender was not identified or apprehended, according to the report, which examined the years 1993 through 2010. Given that missing data, one could speculate the actual number of women and girls killed through the years by intimate partners would be marginally higher. No matter which report is examined, Gretchen Shaw, associate director of the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, said domestic abuse is all too prevalent and deadly in the United States. ""It’s much more common than people ever realize,"" Shaw said. Our ruling Speier said in a tweet that ""3 American women are murdered every day by their husband or boyfriend."" Several domestic violence prevention groups make the same claim on their websites, though they cite data that in some cases is a decade old. We examined an analysis of 2015 homicide data by the Violence Prevention Center, and found that about 2.5 females were killed, on average, by an intimate partner each day in the United States. Speier’s statement could have clarified that assailants include former intimate partners, as well as current ones. Also, her tweet references women, though the victims likely include some teenages. Finally, we found a 2013 Bureau of Justice Statistics report that cautions the relationship between female homicide victims and their killers is unknown in as many as one third of the cases. This makes the actual number of women killed by intimate partners difficult to determine. One could argue the tally is higher than the studies show. We found Speier’s claim is on the right track, but could have used a few clarifications",Mostly True,"February 19, 2018"

"""In the rest of the world, there have been 18 school shootings in the last twenty years. In the U.S., there have been 18 school shootings since January 1.""","Amid the early news reports about a Florida school shooting that left 17 dead on Feb. 14, 2018, longtime network TV journalist and author Jeff Greenfield declared in a tweet: In the rest of the world, there have been 18 school shootings in the last twenty years. In the U.S., there have been 18 school shootings since January 1.
  It’s a provocative claim that drew more the 130,000 likes on Twitter. Greenfield, a University of Wisconsin-Madison graduate, may be on the right track generally in contrasting how much gun violence there is in America compared to the rest of the world. But as for his specific claim, he leaves a misleading impression with the U.S. part and lacks evidence for the part about the rest of the world. U.S. school shootings On the U.S. part of his claim, Greenfield told us his 18 school shootings in 2018 comes from the Everytown for Gun Safety Support Fund, as reported by ABC News. We found that in the immediate aftermath of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, Politico, TIME, CNBC and other national media also reported on Everytown’s 18 figure. In addition, the New York Daily News claimed 18 school shootings, listing the same incidents as Everytown, and HuffPost reported 18, too. But there are some major caveats to that figure. Indeed, when we asked Greenfield for information to back up his claim, he noted to us in his email that the Everytown group’s count ""conflates very different incidents, from the harmless to the deadly."" As PolitiFact National has reported, Everytown, an advocacy group co-founded by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg that seeks to prevent gun violence, uses a broad definition of school shooting -- that is, any time a firearm discharges a live round inside a school building, or on a school campus or grounds. Its database includes incidents when no one was injured; attempted or completed suicide, with no intent to injure others; and cases when a gun was fired unintentionally, resulting in injury or death. The list also includes incidents on college campuses. As we’ll see, Everytown counts shooting incidents that are dramatically different than what happened in Florida: 2018 U.S. school shootings as counted by Everytown Date Place Details Jan. 3 East Olive Elementary, St. Johns, Mich. Man committed suicide in parking lot. No other injuries. (We found the building was not being used as a school, as East Olive had been shut down more than six months earlier.) Jan. 4 New Start High, Seattle Unidentified shooter fired shots into building. No injuries. Jan. 10 Grayson College, Denison, Texas Student unintentionally fired a bullet from gun legally possessed by an instructor that struck a wall. No injuries. Jan. 10 Coronado Elementary, Sierra Vista, Ariz. Student committed suicide in bathroom. No other injuries. Jan. 10 California State University, San Bernardino Gunshots, most likely fired from off campus, hit a campus building window. No injuries. Jan. 15 Wiley College, Marshall, Texas Shots fired from car in parking lot, with one shot hitting window of residence hall. No injuries. Jan. 20 Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, N.C. One student wounds another student during argument at sorority party. Jan. 22 Italy High, Italy, Texas Student opens fire in cafeteria, wounding one student before firing at another student and missing. Jan. 22 NET Charter High, Gentilly, La. Unknown person fired shots at students standing in parking lot. No injuries from gunshots. Jan. 23 Marshall County High, Benton, Ky. 2 students left dead in mass shooting by student. More than a dozen students injured. Jan. 25 Murphy High, Mobile, Ala. Student fired into the air outside school after argument in school. No injuries. Jan. 26 Dearborn High, Dearborn, Mich. Individual ejected from game for fighting was shot at in parking lot. No injuries. Jan. 31 Lincoln High, Philadelphia Man fatally wounded in fight in parking lot. Feb. 1 Salvador B. Castro Middle, Los Angeles Student unintentionally fires gun in classroom, wounds two students. Feb. 5 Oxon Hill High, Oxon Hill, Md. Student wounded in parking lot during apparent robbery. Feb. 5 Harmony Learning K-12, Maplewood, Minn. Student pressed trigger on school liaison officer’s gun. No injuries. Feb. 8 Metropolitan High, New York, N.Y. Student fired gun into floor in classroom. No injuries. Feb. 14 Stoneman Douglas High, Parkland, Fla. Ex-student allegedly commits mass shooting; 17 deaths. So, there are 18 incidents in which a gun was fired inside a school or on school property. Three -- Italy, Texas, Kentucky and Florida -- were mass shootings. But of the other shootings: Nine involved no deaths and no gunshot injuries. Two were suicides, with no other injuries (including the one at the closed school). Three were unintentional (although one caused injuries). Rest of the world As PolitiFact National has noted, mass shootings do happen in other countries. But they do not happen with the same frequency as in the United States. Two researchers -- Jaclyn Schildkraut of the State University of New York in Oswego and H. Jaymi Elsass of Texas State University -- analyzed mass shootings in 11 countries, covering the period from 2000-14. Aside from the United States, they looked at Australia, Canada, China, England, Finland, France, Germany, Mexico, Norway and Switzerland. The United States had more mass shootings -- and more people cumulatively killed or injured -- than the other 10 nations combined, according to their research. While part of this is because the United States has a much bigger population than all but China, the difference can’t be explained by skewed population numbers alone. But as for the other part of Greenfield’s claim -- that there have been only 18 school shootings in the rest of the world over the past 20 years -- Greenfield told us he couldn’t recall the source of that information, adding, ""yes, I cop to insufficient research."" Mark Bryant, executive director of the Gun Violence Archive (which the New York Times uses to track school shooting data), told us the 18-shootings figure could be correct in terms of how many mass shootings occur in schools outside of the United States that get widespread news coverage. But Bryant said there is no way to know -- based on the definition of school shootings that Greenfield relies on -- how many such shootings occur around the globe. About 24 hours after posting the tweet, Greenfield took it down. Our rating In the wake of a Florida school shooting that left 17 people dead, Greenfield said: ""In the rest of the world, there have been 18 school shootings in the last twenty years. In the U.S., there have been 18 school shootings since January 1."" By one count widely cited in the news media, there have been 18 incidents in which shots were fired inside or outside of a school or university building in the United States so far in 2018. But only three involved a mass shooting. And the count includes two suicides, three accidental shootings and nine incidents in which there were no fatalities or injuries. As for the rest of the world, Greenfield had no evidence to back up that part of his claim. And an expert relied on by the New York Times for gun violence statistics told us there is no way to know how many school shootings -- using the definition Greenfield relies on -- have occurred outside of the United States over the past 20 years",Mostly False,"February 15, 2018"
"""One-third of Floridians own guns. One-third.""","After 17 people were killed in a Florida high school shooting on Valentine’s Day, MSNBC political analyst Joy Reid blamed lawmakers’ inaction on gun control and the gun lobby for allowing a proliferation of guns in Florida. ""One-third of Floridians own guns,"" Reid tweeted Feb. 14. ""One-third."" Reid continued: ""Florida is where ‘stand your ground’ laws were born. Florida politicians tried to ban doctors from asking abuse victims if there's a gun in the home. Florida is awash in assault weapons. Want to know why? Ask Marion Hammer and the NRA."" The first ""stand your ground"" law was passed in Florida in 2005, but we wondered about Florida’s gun ownership rate that Reid cited.  We found that Reid’s claim about gun ownership is accurate, based on a study that used 2013 survey. But that study is chock-full of caveats. According to a brief report by Injury Prevention, an international peer-reviewed journal, the gun ownership rate in Florida in 2013 was 32.5 percent, the same as the one-third figure Reid cited. The study, led by former Columbia University public health researcher Bindu Kalesan, extrapolated its numbers from a nationally representative survey of 4,000 people in 2013, that were 18 years or older.  Kalesan, now a professor at Boston University School of Medicine & Boston School of Public Health, told PolitiFact Florida that Reid’s claim is accurate based on the study. The study also found that roughly one-third of the nation owns guns, about 29.1 percent. By state, gun ownership varied considerably, from 5.2 percent in Delaware to 61.7 percent in Alaska. Florida is not an outlier when it comes to gun ownership, based on this study. For example, it showed Texas ownership at 35.9 percent.  We ran the survey by a few experts to get their take on its findings. The biggest complaint was that the survey wasn’t large enough to establish state-based numbers with certainty. ""The survey is not representative of state ownership,"" said Matt Miller, a professor of health sciences and epidemiology at Northeastern University. ""The researchers applied the data to the states even though the source of the data cautioned people not to do that."" Miller and David Hemenway, a professor of health policy at Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said the best measurement for gun ownership in Florida comes from the early 2000s. The Centers for Disease Control’s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System asked health-related questions to hundreds of thousands of people each year.   There were gun questions on the 2001, 2002, and 2004 national questionnaire. Hemenway said in 2001, 24.5 percent of Floridians said they had a gun in the home. It’s worth noting we also found research on the national level from a June 2017 Pew Research Center survey, which found three in 10 U.S. adults said they own a gun, and an additional 36 percent say that ""while they don’t own one now, they might be open to owning a gun in the future."" Just like the Injury Prevention study, the sample size for the study was around 4,000 respondents, but it was not extrapolated to a state level.   Reid said, ""One-third of Floridians own guns."" Reid’s claim is accurate based on a 2015 survey that showed that 32.5 percent of Floridians owned guns 2013. However, experts said that the national survey data was not meant to represent the state level. Having said that, experts agreed there hasn’t been any good research on state ownership levels since the early 2000s when it was around 25 percent in Florida. Reid’s number seems to be in the ballpark, but it’s important for people to know there is some uncertainty",Mostly True,"February 15, 2018"
"""New York has the third lowest rate of gun-caused death in America.""","State Sen. Brian Kavanagh claimed New York state has one of the lowest gun death rates in the country. ""New York has the third-lowest rate of gun-caused death in America,"" Kavanagh said. Kavanagh, a Democrat who represents the Brooklyn waterfront and Lower Manhattan, has introduced legislation that would allow a judge to temporarily restrict someone’s gun rights. Family members or law enforcement officials could ask for such an order for those they believe to be a danger to themselves or others. Kavanagh said his bill would make New York state an even safer place to live. But is he right that the state already ranks third lowest in gun-caused deaths? Data on gun deaths The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tracks firearm mortality by state each year. The data includes suicides, homicides and accidental gun deaths. New York state reported that 4.4 of every 100,000 residents died from gun-related causes in 2016. Only Rhode Island and Massachusetts had lower rates. Massachusetts was lowest, with 3.4 gun-related deaths for every 100,000 residents. Alaska had the highest gun death rate, with 23.3 of every 100,000 people dying from gun-related causes in 2016. New York state reported 900 gun deaths in 2016, the 17th highest number in the country. Texas had the most, with 3,353 such deaths. What’s in the data? More than half of those who died from gun-related causes in New York state took their own life in 2016. The state reported 490 suicides. That said, New York had the third-lowest rate of suicidal gun deaths  -- 2.5 for every 100,000 residents. Montana had 15.5 suicide gun deaths for every 100,000 residents, the highest in the country. New York state ranked higher in gun homicides. About two out of every 100,000 people were killed by a firearm assault in New York state in 2016. Seven states had lower rates, and six other states had so few gun homicides that the CDC considered their calculated death rates unreliable. Our ruling Kavanagh said ""New York has the third-lowest rate of gun-caused death in America."" Government figures confirm Kavanagh’s claim. Only two other states rank lower than New York state in gun deaths. New York state also ranks third lowest in suicidal gun deaths, though the state’s rank climbs when assaults are considered alone",True,"February 1, 2018"
"Says President Barack Obama advocated ""fathers in the home"" as the solution to gun violence.","On Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Republican governor candidate Jeanne Ives was asked a question about reducing gun violence. ""The problem is the gun violence in this city of Chicago, predominantly,"" Ives told a public forum for candidates. ""And you know how you’re going to solve it? Fathers in the home."" After reportedly being booed at the event, Ives, an Illinois state representative from Wheaton, repeated ""fathers in the home,"" according to the Chicago Tribune. The Ives campaign later doubled down on the comment, explaining in a statement released to media that ""many have advocated the same idea, including President Obama."" The Ives statement quoted from a 2008 Father’s Day speech in which then-candidate Obama, himself raised mostly by a single mother and her parents, called on fathers to own up to their family responsibilities. So is Ives seeking to further an idea that was earlier championed by Obama? Did Obama say fathers actively raising their children will solve the epidemic of gun violence in Chicago? We decided to check. Obama’s Father’s Day speech received a lot of attention, analysis and scrutiny at the time. PolitiFact rated one of the dramatic claims in the speech as True: ""More than half of all black children live in single-parent households, a number that has doubled — doubled — since we were children."" Neither Ives in her Martin Luther King Jr. Day comments nor her campaign in its follow-up explanation explicitly mentioned race in connection with the responsibilities of fathers. In fact, the campaign statement sought to draw a link between her assertions and those of Obama by directly quoting from his 2008 Father’s Day speech, yet omitted passages that specifically discussed African-American families. One Obama quote cited by the Ives campaign expressed concern about the absence of too many fathers from homes and families: ""We know the statistics — that children who grow up without a father are five times more likely to live in poverty and commit crime; nine times more likely to drop out of schools and 20 times more likely to end up in prison."" Peniel Joseph, founding director of the Center for the Study of Race and Democracy at the University of Texas, said Ives was off the mark in trying to link Obama’s sentiments to her take on solving gun violence. Joseph, also a professor at Texas’ LBJ School of Public Affairs, said he knows Obama’s Father’s Day speech well and the soon-to-be-president ""never connected that (speech) specifically to ending gun violence. It was more of an observation on black families."" Obama did cite crime as one of the outcomes of broken homes, but Joseph said gun violence can be linked to a broad range of factors. ""It’s connected to the drug trade, unemployment, segregated schools,"" he added. Joseph said he could not recall a time when Obama, in that speech or others, said fathers staying home with their families will reduce gun violence. During his presidency, Obama made several major speeches about gun violence. In a 2013 report, released weeks after a school massacre that killed 20 youngsters in Newtown, Connecticut, Obama proposed a multi-pronged approach to addressing the issue — including improved background checks and other ways to strengthen restrictions on criminals buying guns. Not listed among Obama’s solutions was an emphasis on more two-parent families. April Zeoli, a gun violence expert at Michigan State University, disputed Ives’ prescription for curbing gun violence. ""I haven’t seen this as a real, viable intervention for gun violence in Chicago,"" said Zeoli, an associate professor of criminal justice. In the Ives campaign statement, the candidate also stressed that Obama was just one of ""many"" others who had drawn a link between absentee fathers and gun violence. She did not name other names than Obama’s, however. When we asked her campaign to elaborate, it provided a list of advocacy organizations such as The National Fatherhood Initiative, The National Center for Fathering and The Fatherhood Project. Also on the list provided by the Ives campaign was disgraced comedian Bill Cosby, who is facing retrial in Pennsylvania on charges that he drugged and sexually assaulted a woman. Ives claims she was echoing comments from former President Obama as she declared recently that the solution to curbing rampant gun violence would depend on more fathers taking responsibility for their families. In his 2008 speech, Obama drew a link between children from fatherless homes and those who stray into crime. But Ives took it a lot further than Obama ever did. Her sweeping claim is not supported by the passages from Obama’s speech that her campaign pointed to as evidence. A reading of the full speech doesn’t support Ives either. As president, Obama made several speeches about the proliferation of guns and violence, and also laid out an array of proposals to deal with the problems. In his public pronouncements, however, Obama did not make statements linking the problem of absent fathers with gun violence. Ives is taking the message from Obama’s 2008 Father’s Day speech out of context",False,"January 26, 2018"
"Says the concealed carry bill would allow residents of certain states to ""travel to your community and walk right into a school zone with a loaded weapon, no matter what local laws say.""","The House passed a bill Dec. 6 that would make permits to carry a concealed weapon issued in one state valid in all other states, similarly to how driver’s licenses are recognized across state lines. Republicans attached the concealed carry measure to a bipartisan bill to strengthen the national background check system, causing House Democrats to sour on the legislative package. On the eve of the vote, one Democratic lawmaker warned the expansion of concealed-carry rights would prevent states from keeping guns away from schools. ""There are 12 states that don’t require permits for carrying guns. Under #HR38, someone from one of those states could travel to your community and walk right into a school zone with a loaded weapon, no matter what local laws say,"" Rep. Brendan Boyle, D-Pa., tweeted Dec. 5, referring to House Resolution 38. ""This bill is a nightmare. #StopCCR.""  There are 12 states that don’t require permits for carrying guns. Under #HR38, someone from one of those states could travel to your community and walk right into a school zone with a loaded weapon, no matter what local laws say. This bill is a nightmare. #StopCCR As the House-passed bill moves to the Senate, we decided to look at whether Boyle’s claim about the effects on state gun laws was correct. It turns out his read on the bill is misleading. Historically, each state has determined its own scheme for regulating concealed carry, which led to the current patchwork of varying laws and standards across the country. Thirty-eight states require gun owners to obtain a state-issued permit before than can lawfully carry a concealed weapon in public. A dozen states — as Boyle noted — require no permit. Traditionally, states have decided for themselves whether to honor out-of-state permits, a legal concept known as ""reciprocity."" Under the broad strokes of the House-passed Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act, having a concealed-carry permit issued by one state makes it legal to carry in any state. And according to Boyle, the Republican measure would supersede state and local laws concerning the carry of concealed weapons in school zones. But a close reading of the interplay between the House-passed bill and state gun laws shows that’s not the case. Before discussing what Boyle gets wrong, it’s worth noting that his claim would have been more accurate if he’d taken aim at federal law, not state law. The federal Gun-Free School Zones Act generally prohibits concealed carry in a school zone, which is defined as a distance of 1,000 feet from the grounds of a public, parochial or private school. But the law makes an exception for people who hold a concealed carry permit from the state in which the school zone is located, according to David Kopel, a policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute. So under the Gun-Free School Zones Act, a permit issued by State A would allow you to legally carry in a school zone located in State A, but not a school zone in State B, Kopel said. But the bill the House voted on says that people with concealed-carry permits aren’t subject to the restrictions in the Gun-Free School Zones Act. In other words, Kopel said, if you had a permit from State A, and carried a gun into a school zone in State B, you would face no penalty under the Gun-Free School Zones Act. So Boyle would have been accurate to say the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act overrides federal law concerning the carry of concealed weapons in a school zone. But his claim was about state and local laws. Boyle specifically said the bill would allow residents of one of the dozen states that allow permitless concealed carry to ""walk right into a school zone with a loaded weapon, no matter what local laws say."" A large majority of states prohibit non-school employees from carrying in schools, even with a concealed carry permit. So if Boyle were correct, the House bill would stand to cancel out a great deal of gun regulation at the state level. But the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act clearly states that it does not supersede state law — the opposite of Boyle's claim. Under the bill, permit-holders would still be subject to any state or local laws that restrict the carry of a gun in a school or a designated zone around it. The bill reads: ""This section shall not be construed to supersede or limit the laws of any state that permit private persons or entities to prohibit or restrict the possession of concealed firearms on their property, or prohibit or restrict the possession of firearms on any state or local government property, installation, building, base, or park."" So if the bill becomes law, states would still be free to ban the carry of guns in school zones — and the federal law would also yield to any future laws passed by the minority of states that now generally allow concealed-carry permit holders to carry in schools. ""That’s precisely the opposite of Boyle’s point, which was local laws are irrelevant,"" said Adam Winkler, law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. Joseph Blocher, a law professor at Duke University who specializes in federal and state constitutional law, agreed that Boyle’s statement is misleading. ""If the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act passes, someone from a permitless state could walk into a school zone without violating any federal law, since HR 38 basically rescinds the Gun Free School Zones Act,"" he said. ""But the part about ‘no matter what local laws say’ isn’t right."" Boyle said the concealed carry bill would allow residents of certain states to ""travel to your community and walk right into a school zone with a loaded weapon, no matter what local laws say."" While the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act would override a federal law concerning the carry of concealed weapons in a school zone, Boyle is wrong about how the bill would affect state and local gun laws.

The tweet featured a Breitbart article with the information and a link to FBI crime data. We weren’t sure about stabbings killing more people than rifles, so we decided to check the numbers for ourselves. Schroer’s office pointed us to the same data as the Breitbart article, so we started there. First, it appears that the Breitbart article is talking about national numbers, so we assume Schroer is doing the same. Schroer uses the term ""rifles."" The data provided by the FBI breaks down murders by types of firearms, and rifles is a subsection of all firearm murders. When totaling the data from the FBI crime report, we see that 374 people were killed by rifles, while 1,604 were killed by knives or cutting instruments. That means about 4.3 times as many people were killed by knives or cutting instruments as were killed by rifles. ""He is comparing a full set of cutting instruments to a partial set of guns which makes cutting instruments look more deadly,"" said Dr. James Nolan, a sociology professor at West Virginia University. Nolan used to work for the FBI as a unit chief in the Crime Analysis, Research and Development Unit. ""The real story from the data is that the odds of being murdered by a firearm are nearly seven times higher than the odds of being murdered by a knife or cutting instrument,"" he said. When you look at firearms murders overall, the number is staggeringly different: 11,004 murders out of 15,070 total murders were committed with firearms. That is, 73 percent of U.S. murders were committed with firearms — 3.4 percent of firearm murders were committed with a rifle. The other categories are shotguns, handguns and ""type unknown."" The FBI acknowledges the data are not comprehensive: Not all homicide data is submitted to the FBI. The page holding the data has a disclaimer that says, ""The data are based on the aggregated data from agencies within each state for which supplemental homicide data (i.e., weapon information) were reported to the FBI."" It also points out that Florida’s data didn’t meet regulations and is not included, and Illinois and Alabama submitted limited data. That means a few large cities, like Chicago, may not be perfectly represented in this data. Also, murders in the ""type unknown"" category could include rifles but were not identified as such when submitted to the FBI. That could change the comparison of rifles to stabbings. Schroer said that more than four times as many people were stabbed to death than were shot and killed by rifles in 2016. Schroer is cherry-picking data by comparing all people who were stabbed to death versus a small percentage of those that were shot to death. In 2016, 73 percent of U.S. murders were committed with firearms, but while 10.6 percent were committed with some type of knife or cutting instrument, just 2.5 percent were committed using rifles",Mostly True,"November 18, 2017"
"""Bump stocks are already illegal in the state of New York. You can't buy one.""","Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo says New York state law already bans the accessory a gunman used to kill 58 people in Las Vegas last month. The accessory, called a bump stock, allows someone to convert a semi-automatic firearm to a nearly fully automatic one. Lawmakers in New York state have introduced legislation to ban the accessory, but Cuomo during a conference call with reporters called the bill unnecessary. ""The bump stocks are already illegal in the state of New York,"" Cuomo said. ""You can't buy one."" Is Cuomo right? What’s in state law Technically, New York state has banned the use of bump stocks for more than 80 years. The State Legislature passed a law in 1931 that said ""a person who sells or keeps for sale, or offers, or gives, or disposes of any instrument or weapon of the kind usually known as a machine-gun to any person is guilty of a felony."" That statute exists today, but instead says anyone who owns, ""manufactures or causes to be manufactured any machine-gun"" or weapon simulating a machine gun is guilty of a felony. A machine gun is defined as a weapon that can fire a number of shots with one continuous pull of the trigger. A bump stock modifies a gun to simulate that. What’s not in state law Assemblywoman Patricia A. Fahy was one of the first lawmakers to introduce legislation banning bump stocks in New York state after the Las Vegas shooting. She contended that while using a bump stock might be illegal in New York state, owning or selling one is not. The New York State Police agree with her. ""It’s OK to have a bump stock in the back of your car,"" State Police Spokesperson Beau Duffy said. ""But the minute you attach it to a semiautomatic rifle, it’s illegal in New York state."" Bump stocks are not regulated by the state or federal government, so just having one is not a crime, Duffy said. You can also sell them in New York state without penalty. That means you can also legally buy one in New York state without going through a background check, whether it’s through a gun shop or a private seller. National gun law experts have the same understanding of the law. ""Though this current law functionally prohibits New Yorkers from possessing firearms that are equipped with bump stocks or similar devices, our understanding is that it does not prohibit possession of bump stock devices that are un-attached to a firearm,"" said Ari Freilich, a staff attorney at the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. Many of the guns a bump stock would work with are now illegal for new gun owners under the SAFE Act in New York state. That doesn’t mean they don’t exist. Residents were allowed to keep guns outlawed by the SAFE Act as long as they registered them with the state by April 2014. Cuomo’s response A spokeswoman for Cuomo clarified that the governor meant to say that someone could not buy and then use a bump stock in New York. ""The governor was stating you cannot buy a bump stock in New York and affix it to a weapon, which is banned under the state’s penal law,"" Abbey Fashouer said. Our ruling Cuomo said ""bump stocks are already illegal in the state of New York. You can't buy one."" That’s not true. It’s illegal to use a bump stock in New York state but you can buy and own one",Mostly False,"November 17, 2017"
"""Many firearms experts determined the Las Vegas shooter’s use of a bump stock actually prevented more casualties and (injuries) due to its inconsistency, inaccuracy, and lack of control.""","Some legislators see the legal manufacture and use of bump stocks — found on 12 of the 23 guns in the Las Vegas gunman’s Mandalay Bay hotel room — as a loophole in firearms regulation. State Sen. Michael Williams, a Republican candidate running in Georgia’s gubernatorial primary, recently came out against any legislation banning the devices, which can be attached to a semiautomatic weapon to simulate the rate of fire of a fully automatic weapon. To stress his point, he announced he would give away a free bump stock to a random person who enters the giveaway event. ""The tragedy in Las Vegas broke my heart, but any talk of banning or regulating bump stocks is merely cheap political lip service from career politicians,"" Williams said in a news release. ""In reality, the bump stock is the new, shiny object politicians are using to deceive voters into believing they are taking action against gun violence."" Williams continued: ""Many firearms experts determined the Las Vegas shooter’s use of a bump stock actually prevented more casualties and injures (sic) due to its inconsistency, inaccuracy, and lack of control."" That didn’t sound right to us, because the basic point of a bump stock is to help someone shoot really fast. The device allows the recoil from firing a semiautomatic weapon to slide the firearm back and forth. The movement ""bumps"" the trigger against the shooter’s finger without having to manually squeeze the trigger for each shot. We should note that police have not yet said precisely which weapons were used in the shooting. But we wanted to look into the claim that the gunman would have hurt fewer people had he not had the ability to fire rapidly. Is this a popular expert opinion? So who are these experts? We reached out to Williams and his campaign but received no response. The campaign has previously pointed to a post from Legally Armed America — written by Paul Glasco, who reviews guns and gun products — that argued that a ban on bump fire stocks would be useless to prevent these kind of attacks. As part of our own research, we talked to five experts who said Williams is factually correct on one point about the nature of this attachment: Because because bump stocks use a weapon’s recoil to allow the user to fire rapidly and repeatedly, the use of a bump stock makes the weapon more difficult to control when firing. This decreases the weapon’s accuracy, which depends on a weapon’s steadiness. Two experts supportive of gun rights — United States Concealed Carry Association president Tim Schmidt and lawyer John Pierce — were not convinced bump stocks would have made the crime more deadly. They agreed that a more accurate weapon could have hurt more people, but they needed more information about the crime to come to a conclusion. But three of the five experts said the rapid gunfire is likely what made the recent shooting so devastating. Adam Winkler, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, who specializes in firearms, said the use of a semiautomatic weapon without a bump stock would have made a difference if the Las Vegas gunman was trying to hurt a specific person. ""When you don’t care who you hit, being a little more inaccurate doesn’t matter,"" Winkler said.  To be fair, Arthur Alphin, a retired Army lieutenant colonel and West Point graduate, made the case to the Los Angeles Times that accuracy did matter, but so did the rapid fire. The weapon could have been held steady with a bipod, which was found in the gunman’s room.  If the gunman had been trained by military or law enforcement, an unaltered semiautomatic weapon could have been more harmful than one outfitted with a bump stock, said Rick Vasquez, a former assistant chief and acting chief of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives’ firearms technology branch. But given the gunman’s lack of formal training and the fact that the crowd at the Route 91 Harvest music festival was somewhat blocked in, ""any device that is going to spray a lot of ammunition is going to be more deadly,"" Vasquez said. ""He was shooting into a densely packed crowd of thousands of people,"" said Gary Kleck, a criminologist from Florida State University who studies the effects of guns on injuries and death in crimes. ""The main effect of using bump stocks in this particular situation was to increase the number of rounds the shooter could fire in a short period of time before police crashed into his hotel room, which increased the numbers of victims hit somewhat randomly."" The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department declined to comment, citing the ongoing nature of the investigation. Williams said many firearms experts have determined that the use of a bump stock in the Las Vegas shooting prevented more injuries and deaths than would have otherwise occurred had he not used a bump stock. Outside of a blog from a pro-gun rights group, we did not find ""many firearms experts"" making that argument. We did learn that bump stock devices tend to affect a weapon’s accuracy. But we found several firearms experts who attributed the high number of people injured and killed to the shooter’s ability to fire rapidly, which a bump stock would have amplified",False,"November 13, 2017"
"""In 2010, 48,000 felons and fugitives lied and illegally tried to purchase guns. They [The Obama administration] prosecuted only 44 of them.""","U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas suggested that Barack Obama’s administration bears some responsibility for the mass shooter in a Texas town acquiring guns. In a late-night Nov. 6, 2017, interview with Shannon Bream of Fox News, the Republican senator said that he’d spent the day comforting residents of Sutherland Springs, where the shooter killed 26 people in a church. Cruz said he felt his anger rising on his return flight to Washington ""because,"" Cruz told Bream, ""this should have  been stopped beforehand. Under federal law, it was illegal for this individual to purchase a firearm. He had a conviction for a crime that’s punishable by more than a year in prison and he had a conviction for multiple domestic violence crimes. Both of those, it’s already ineligible. ""But several things happened,"" Cruz said. ""Number one, the Air Force, the Obama administration, didn’t report those convictions to the NICS (National Instant Criminal Background Check System) database. That’s an endemic problem; it’s a problem with the federal government, it’s a problem with the states. ""And so, when he went in to buy the guns, they ran the background check and they didn’t find it because it wasn’t in the database. But I’ll tell you we could have prevented this. In 2013, in the wake of Sandy Hook, I joined with Chuck Grassley, we introduced legislation, it was called the Grassley-Cruz legislation, and it was aggressive legislation targeting felons and violent criminals to stop them from getting guns."" Cruz went on: ""There were a couple elements of that legislation that were critical. One, it mandated that federal agencies including the Air Force report to the NICS because that was a problem back then. But two, and this is an even more critical piece, if it had been reported to the background database, when he went into Academy to buy this, these weapons, he lied on the forms. That is a felony to lie on those forms. The Obama administration didn’t prosecute those cases. In 2010,"" Cruz said, ""48,000 felons and fugitives lied and illegally tried to purchase guns. They prosecuted only 44 of them."" Readers request fact-check We’re not checking all of what Cruz said though PolitiFact in Washington found Mostly False Cruz claim’s in the interview that Democrats filibustered legislation that would’ve resulted in the Texas church shooter being in prison rather than wreaking havoc. Readers asked us if Cruz was correct about the very few prosecutions of individuals for lying while buying a gun from a licensed dealer. Previous fact-checks A 1993 law requires a criminal history background check by the FBI or a state agency. If a potential buyer fails the check, the gun sale is denied and the case is referred to the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and Explosives (ATF), the lead investigative agency in gun enforcement.  The automated national instant background check system began operating in 1998. Some perspective: In 2013, our colleagues at PolitiFact Virginia reviewed federal reports before concluding that the Justice Department hadn’t been prioritizing perjury charges in connection with background checks for at least two administrations. During George W. Bush’s presidency, there had been 70,000 denials for gun purchases a year and some 15/100th of 1 percent of such cases were prosecuted. In the first two years of Obama’s presidency, 8/100th of 1 percent of such cases were prosecuted. By email, a Cruz spokesman, Phil Novack, told us Cruz drew on a 2012 federal report to reach his 2010 figures. Novack noted too that when Cruz made a similar claim in 2013, the Fact Checker at The Washington Post confirmed the declared 44 prosecutions based on information in the report. 2010 statistics In 2010, the report says, FBI background checks led to initial denials of 72,659 applications to purchase a gun--with 34,451 denials attributed to a person’s felony indictment or conviction and 13,862 due to the person being a fugitive from justice--48,313 combined. But most of those denials never made it to prosecutorial consideration. The report says the ATF overturned, canceled or chose not to refer for further investigation 71,410 denial cases sent its way by the FBI; some 4,732 cases were then referred to field offices for further review. Ultimately, the report says, 62 cases were referred for federal prosecution with 18 of those not taken up by a prosecutor--which leaves 44. Then again, that doesn’t mean 44 prosecutions proceeded. That’s because a dozen referrals were still pending action by a prosecutor as of Dec. 13, 2011, the report says. Otherwise, an accompanying chart shows that the 44 possible prosecutions would have been down from 77 prosecutions the year before and 105 in 2008--and prosecutorial referrals also had declined through those years. By phone, we asked the report’s author, Ron Frandsen, about the availability of more recent data. Frandsen, who works for the Missouri-based Regional Justice Information Service, said that to his knowledge, no analyses of post-2010 data have been funded. By email, Frandsen said that most likely, the 48,321 denied applications tallied for felony or fugitive reasons were found in FBI background checks after applicants failed to disclose such information on a form. ""FBI denials are referred to ATF, which investigates the cases deemed most worthy of possible prosecution. From the 2010 FBI denials, ATF referred 62 charges (against 33 people) to U.S. or state attorneys for possible prosecution,"" Frandsen said, involving nine different federal offenses and two to seven state offenses. Frandsen said Cruz was accurate in his reference to 48,000 denials. He said the reference to 44 prosecutions wasn’t accurate because the ""44"" from the service’s report refers to charges, not individual people, and those charges involved ""more than just felons and fugitives, and,"" Frandsen wrote, ""because some of the prosecutorial decisions were made by state attorneys."" There’s more data available, PolitiFact reporters have noted, in a 2013 analysis of federal weapons cases by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, based at Syracuse University. The analysis doesn’t mention background checks directly. But a chart lists 123 prosecutions in 2010 in which the lead charge was making false/fictitious statements in order to acquire a firearm or ammunition. The comparable count was 143 in 2011 and 170 in 2012, the chart states. The relevant law says it’s unlawful for anyone acquiring a firearm from a licensed dealer to knowingly make false or fictitious oral or written statements intended to deceive the seller about the sale’s legality. Explaining the few prosecutions Why has Uncle Sam seemingly been reluctant to prosecute these cases? A 2004 report from the Justice Department’s inspector general provided several answers. It said ATF agents viewed the violations ""as distracting from more important cases, such as those involving firearms, traffickers, gangs, arson and explosives"" and ""saw little purpose in investigating a standard case in which the NICS successfully prohibited a person from purchasing a firearm."" The report also said that the cases lack ""jury appeal"" for prosecutors because it is difficult to prove that a prohibited person intentionally lied on the background check and in many parts of the nation ""juries are reluctant to convict a person who attempted to purchase a hunting rifle."" Frandsen told us he hasn’t researched in depth why few violations get prosecuted. But, he said, such cases are hard to prosecute ""because the government must prove that the denied person intentionally failed to disclose a prohibition on the federal form (as opposed to just being unaware of what was on their record)."" Also, he said, there’s a belief that the main purpose of the background check requirement is to prevent a firearm transfer to a prohibited person--and the additional step of prosecution ""should be reserved for the most dangerous people, especially those with an extensive criminal history."" Our ruling Cruz said: ""In 2010, 48,000 felons and fugitives lied and illegally tried to purchase guns"" and the Obama administration ""prosecuted only 44 of them."" There may have been even fewer federal prosecutions of such felons and fugitives, figures indicate, though Cruz failed to note that this paucity wasn’t unique to one administration. It’s also worth clarifying that we don’t know if all 48,000 individuals knowingly misled the government. Few of the tallied background checks resulted in further investigation",Mostly True,"November 10, 2017"
"""The Democrats filibustered the legislation that would’ve resulted in this shooter being in federal prison instead of murdering those innocents in that Texas church.""","Reacting to the church shootings in Sutherland Springs, Texas, Sen. Ted Cruz said there could have been laws on the books to prevent what happened, had his opponents in Congress not defeated his proposal a few years ago. ""The Democrats filibustered the legislation that would’ve resulted in this shooter being in federal prison instead of murdering those innocents in that Texas church,"" Cruz said on Fox News on Nov. 6. Cruz, a Republican, is talking about a failed amendment he co-sponsored to curtail an expansion of background checks and increase prosecution of people who lied about their criminal histories to obtain firearms. He has a point that the Democrats didn’t back it, but he fails to mention that every amendment on the 2013 gun control bill faced the same hurdle, and a Democratic one also fell short. While Democrats defeated his proposal, experts said it would not have made the crucial difference in this massacre for a couple of reasons. The Texas church shooter was discharged from the Air Force for bad conduct after he was court-martialed in 2012 for assaulting his wife and fracturing his stepson's skull. Federal law prohibited him from buying or possessing firearms after this conviction, but he got past the background check system because the Air Force failed to enter the shooter’s felony into the background check database. So when he purchased two guns at the San Antonio gun shop Academy Sports + Outdoors, both sales were approved by the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. When we asked Cruz’s office for details, they softened what Cruz originally said, saying his legislation would have ""increased the chances of preventing the Air Force error that led to the failure to submit the relevant information to NICS."" The amendment pushed for clearer guidance on submissions of federal records to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (mandated by NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007) and required that federal agencies submit plans for making the information available. ""The only possible contribution may have been that the reporting requirement to the AG might have led the Defense Department and the Air Force to realize that the procedures they had in place needed enhancement,"" said Geoffrey Corn, a law professor at South Texas College of Law Houston. But the language was a near replica of President Barack Obama’s Jan. 16, 2013 memorandum to the Justice Department, which officials were already trying to implement. Molly Moran, who served as the Principal Deputy Associate Attorney General from 2014 to 2016, said she and her colleagues at the Justice Department worked from 2013 until the end of Obama’s second term in implementing the memo. It made no difference in the Texas church shooting. The Air Force needed to submit the shooter’s 2012 court-martial, and it failed to do so. Cruz said on Fox that a lack of reporting of federal and state records to the background check system was a problem. But his legislation did not seem to make this easier. The amendment eliminated sanctions for states that failed to submit records and lowered the cap on grant money to help states submit them from $100 million to $20 million. The original bill from then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., would have expanded background checks on purchases from only federally licensed gun dealers to all transfers, even private ones among family members, with few exceptions. But the Grassley-Cruz amendment chucked the expansion of background checks and even allowed for the interstate sale and transportation of firearms. ""If anything, the only way this would have affected the Texas shooting would be to make it easier for the shooter to attack a church in a neighboring state instead,"" said Gregory Koger, a political science professor at the University of Miami. Cruz also summoned a familiar talking point against gun regulation that few background check lies (where felons say they are not felons) are prosecuted. His amendment created a task force to increase these prosecutions, but it did not mandate that the Justice Department prosecute all of them. Enhanced prosecution efforts still would not have put the shooter behind bars. Without the court-martial in the database, the shooter would still have passed the background check after marking that he was not a felon. ""He could have been prosecuted had his lie been known by prosecutors, but they had no reason to investigate this until after the shooting,"" said Adam Winkler, a law professor at University of California, Los Angeles. Reid set a 60-vote threshold on all amendments to his Safe Communities, Safe Schools Act of 2013 to prevent a situation in which the amendment passed by a bare majority and then was filibustered — by the Republican minority. Cruz’s amendment failed 52-48, with nine Democrats voting for it and two Republicans voting against (Mark Kirk of Illinois and Mike Lee of Utah). So did the bipartisan Toomey-Manchin background check amendment favored by Democrats, which got 54 votes. Experts said it was fair to call this a filibuster, though Reid attained the Senate's unanimous consent for the 60-vote threshold. ""The notion that the Democrats are responsible for the failure of this proposal ignores the fact that the GOP was filibustering the underlying bill, which had all the same provisions except the state-to-state expansion of gun rights and a requirement to expand background checks,"" Koger said. Cruz said, ""The Democrats filibustered the legislation that would’ve resulted in this shooter being in federal prison."" The amendment Cruz cosponsored, which was defeated largely by Democrats after failing to reach a 60-vote threshold, strengthened efforts to prosecute people who lied about their criminal histories to obtain firearms. But the shooter in this case wouldn’t have showed up as having lied because of the Air Force’s failure to report his felony. The Cruz proposal also aimed to facilitate reporting to the instant background check system with guidelines and deadlines for federal agencies, including the armed services. While similar action by the Obama Justice Department around the same time didn’t help, Cruz’s clarifications becoming law may have. But it’s impossible to say with any certainty",Mostly False,"November 10, 2017"
"Chicago is ""the city with the strongest gun laws in our nation.""","President Donald Trump might be in Asia, but violence on the homefront followed him to South Korea. In a joint press conference with South Korean President Moon Jae-in, a reporter asked Trump if he would consider extreme vetting for people trying to buy a gun in the wake of the mass shooting at a Texas church. Trump said a longer waiting period would have made no difference and then drew on a familiar talking point. ""You look at the city with the strongest gun laws in our nation, is Chicago, and Chicago is a disaster,"" Trump said. Trump used this line during the presidential campaign, with particular emphasis on Chicago’s high murder rate. Our partners at PolitiFact Illinois said he had a point about the murders, but his description of the Windy City having the toughest gun laws was way off the mark. Since then, the administration has taken the line even further into inaccurate territory. Here’s why. There are two ways to measure the toughness of gun laws. You can look at the rules controlling gun ownership and the penalties for misuse of a weapon. From 1982 to 2010, Chicago prohibited people from keeping handguns in their homes. When Washington, D.C., saw a similar ban overturned, Chicago did have the toughest gun law in the country. That lasted about two years. The U.S. Supreme Court overturned the Chicago ordinance in 2010. The plaintiffs in the case of McDonald vs. City of Chicago argued that the ban left them vulnerable to criminals, and the court agreed. The court said that the Second and 14th Amendments protected the right to bear arms and that neither Chicago nor Illinois could interfere with that. At one time, the state of Illinois prevented gun owners from carrying a concealed weapon. That ended in 2013 when the state became the last in the country to allow the practice. To get a gun in Chicago, you must take a firearms training class and get a Chicago firearms permit. The course costs between $100 and $150 and the permit costs $100. You would also need a state firearms owner identification card, which can take as many as 50 days for processing. It’s harder and requires more time to do the same in New York. It takes about three to six months to get a permit and costs over $400. And unlike Chicago, New York runs its own concealed carry permit process, as does Los Angeles. Chicago also isn't particularly tough when it comes to enforcement. A 2014 Chicago Sun Times analysis found that Chicago judges tended to hand down the minimum sentence of one year for illegal gun possession while the maximum is three years. Felons with a weapon got four-year sentences on average while they could have received 10. On the state level, the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, a pro-gun control group, gives many states higher rankings for restricting gun ownership and use. A total of seven states, including New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Jersey, Maryland, California and Hawaii, have rules that go beyond what Illinois has. The group said Illinois could bring up its score if it allowed local governments to pass gun laws, required guns be stored safely at home and gave local law enforcement more leeway to deny conceal carry permits. The one area where Chicago is trying to reduce access to weapons is by not allowing gun stores or firing ranges to open within the city limits. So far, courts have ruled against Chicago. We reached out to the White House and did not hear back. Trump said Chicago has the strongest gun laws in the nation. The statement is years out of date. After a Supreme Court ruling, Chicago residents can own handguns and carry them unseen on the streets. A national gun control group puts seven states above Illinois in regulating gun ownership. Trump needs to refresh this talking point",False Pants on Fire,"November 7, 2017"
"""There are no background checks on long guns (AR15s) in Texas.""","Actress Alyssa Milano drew attention to gun background checks after a shooting at a Texas church left at least 26 people dead.

No background check required. https://t.co/H0oqxgEsx9 By mid-day Nov. 6, Milano’s message had been retweeted more than 3,200 times and ""liked"" by more than 7,800 Twitter users. Given the controversial national discourse on gun control, we wanted to know if Milano was right about background checks and long guns in Texas. We found her tweet to be partly accurate: licensed manufacturers, importers, and dealers must conduct a background check for the transfer of all firearms, but private sellers are not required to run such background checks. We reached out to Milano for comment but did not hear back. Law enforcement officials identified 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley as the gunman who killed 26 people and injured 20 others at First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, on Nov. 5. Freeman Martin, a regional director of the Texas Department of Public Safety, said at a Nov. 6 press conference that the shooting was not over religious beliefs. The suspect’s mother-in-law attended the church (though not present during the shooting) and had received threatening texts from Kelley. ""There was a domestic situation going on with this family,"" Martin said. Kelley dropped a ""Ruger AR assault-type rifle"" and fled the church, according to Martin. Kelley was found dead in his vehicle after a car chase and crash. Details on the cause of his death are developing. Milano tweeted that in Texas there are no background checks on long guns, such as AR-15-style rifles. (AR-15-style rifles look like military rifles ""but function like other semi-automatic civilian sporting firearms, firing only one round with each pull of the trigger,"" according to the National Shooting Sports Foundation.) Texas does not have a state law requiring any seller to run a background check on purchasers of any gun, said Ari Freilich, a staff attorney at the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. But there is federal law requiring background checks in some cases, she said. ""Federal law requires federally licensed gun dealers, importers, and manufacturers to run background checks before selling firearms of any kind to an unlicensed buyer,"" Freilich said. However, unlicensed, private sellers are not required by federal law to run background checks on individuals purchasing firearms. Many Twitter users pointed out this distinction to Milano. Appearing to have noticed the challenges to her claim, Milano tweeted less than two hours later: ""Background checks aren’t REQUIRED in Texas on long guns. If you buy from Walmart, they’ll do one. If you buy privately they don’t have to."" Background checks aren’t REQUIRED in Texas on long guns. If you buy from Walmart, they’ll do one. If you buy privately they don’t have to. Watts, whom Milano credited for her information, also later specified in tweets that no background checks were required for private sales of long guns. Some states do have restrictions on the private sale of firearms. For instance, in California such sales must be done through a licensed dealer. A study published in January 2017 asked 1,613 adult gun owners where and when they acquired their last firearm, including whether it was purchased, and whether they had either a background check or were asked to show a firearm license or permit. Twenty-two percent said they obtained their gun without a background check. Milano tweeted, ""There are no background checks on long guns (AR15s) in Texas."" Federal law does require background checks when a firearm is sold or transferred by licensed gun dealers, importers, and manufacturers. That includes long guns. But private, unlicensed sellers are not required to conduct background checks under federal or Texas law, even though other states have added requirements to that effect.

Freedumjunkshun.com, a self-avowed fake news website, portrayed the perpetrator as a desperate Democratic activist whose killing spree at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, was motivated by atheism. ""FBI and Texas State Police are both confirming that Raymond Peter Littleberry, the man accused of shooting up a Texas church, was an avid atheist on the payroll of the Democrat National Committee,"" the article claimed. The fake news article missed basic facts and fabricated others. It wrongly identified the alleged shooter as Raymond Peter Littleberry. Law enforcement officials identified the gunman as 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley. Some media reports quoted acquaintances of Kelley describing the man as an avowed atheist. But the fake news article’s claim that atheism motivated the attack was undercut by law enforcement officials who said religion was not a factor, and that the shooting appeared to stem from a ""domestic situation."" ""There was a domestic situation going on with this family. The suspect's mother-in-law attended this church. We know that she had received threatening texts from him,"" Freeman Martin of the Texas Department of Public Safety told reporters in a Nov. 6 press conference. Martin added the shooting ""wasn't over religious beliefs."" The fake news article portrayed the perpetrator as ""a liberal island in the middle of a conservative sea"" who organized Black Lives Matter protests and gay pride parades. It noted that the shooter ""was on the DNC payroll,"" in reference to the Democratic National Committee. ""That’s completely false,"" DNC spokesman Michael Tyler told PolitiFact of the alleged connection. Freedumjunkshun aims to dupe conservative readers into mistaking its satire for truth. ""Here we gather a boatload of bullhonkey, works of pure satirical fiction, to give the fist-shakers of the world a reason to hate,"" its disclaimer reads. ""Reality is often in the eye of the beholder. You won’t find any of it here.""

"""Part of this omnibus gun bill that year (was) legalizing machine guns in the state of Missouri.""","Following one of the deadliest mass shootings in modern U.S. history in Las Vegas, State Rep. Nick Marshall, R-Parkville, was critical of the political rhetoric and expressed his discontent in an Oct. 2 Missourinet article. ""When it comes to automatic weapons, that’s a federal issue as you know,"" Marshall said. State Rep. Stacey Newman, D-Richmond Heights, told Missourinet that Marshall was incorrect on automatic weapons being a federal issue. She pointed to House Bill 294, which passed in 2011. ""Part of this omnibus gun bill that year (was) legalizing machine guns in the state of Missouri,"" Newman said. ""We legalized them here. And ever since then, continually my whole time in the legislature, we have loosened restriction."" We were wondering, are machine guns legal in Missouri? Are they under federal or state jurisdiction? And, has Missouri loosened restrictions on them? We tried to reach out to Newman to clarify her statement, but received no response. We spoke with people knowledgeable on gun laws in Missouri, who said that when it came to Newman’s statement, there’s context missing and multiple ways to interpret it. Basically, a machine gun is an automatic weapon that is capable of firing more than one round per trigger pull, Allen Rostron, law professor at University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law, said in an email. A semi-automatic requires a finger pull for each round but automatically loads the chamber after a shot. The sale of automatic weapons has been restricted since the National Firearms Act was enacted in 1934. The act was inspired, in part, because of frequent use of machine guns in crime, including the 1929 St. Valentine’s Day Massacre in Chicago and the 1933 Union Station Massacre in Kansas City. The original act imposed a tax on automatic weapons and required they be registered with the Secretary of the Treasury, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. ""It essentially amounted to a ban, because it became a crime to possess a machine gun without having it properly registered with the government,"" Rostron said. ""But technically it wasn’t actually a ban, because it didn’t prohibit machine guns. It just made them subject to much stricter regulations than other guns."" In 1986, Congress passed additional regulations that cut off the supply of new machine guns to civilian buyers. Any existing machine guns manufactured before May 19, 1986, are still allowed to be purchased and were grandfathered into the law. Essentially, that’s where the federal law stands today. ""There are something like 400,000 or 500,000 of these machine guns that are legally possessed by civilians in the United States,"" Rostron said. Prior to 2011, Missouri prohibited the possession of machine guns in the state. HB 294, which Newman referenced, ""Allows a person to possess, manufacture, transport, repair, or sell a machine gun, short barreled rifle or shotgun, or firearm silencer if he or she conforms with federal law,"" according to the bill summary. The bill passed by a majority in both the House and the Senate and was signed into law by Gov. Jay Nixon. ""So in other words, Missouri went from having a stricter law that completely banned machine guns to having a law that said you’re allowed to have a machine gun if federal law permits it,"" Rostron said. As of April 2017, there were 9,588 machine guns registered in Missouri, according to a 2017 ATF report, said Hannah Shearer, staff attorney and Second Amendment litigation director for the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, a group that advocates for more restrictive gun regulation. So is Marshall or Newman correct that machine guns are a federal or state issue? Well, it depends. Marshall is correct that federal law has the ultimate jurisdiction over machine guns. However, states can impose stricter laws that go beyond federal law, such as Missouri did prior to 2011. ""Rep. Marshall’s statement is incomplete or inaccurate to the extent it suggests state law is completely irrelevant to this,"" Rostron said. ""So it is not purely a federal issue as he seemed to suggest."" However, Newman’s statement could also be misleading. She is correct that machine guns were legalized in Missouri, but they must still comply with federal law. ""If her statement gives people the impression that machine guns have been legalized in Missouri and so now they’re not subject to any special restrictions, then that is not correct, because machine guns remain subject to the federal (National Firearms Act) restrictions that apply throughout the nation,"" Rostron said. ""This is theater,"" St. Louis University School of Law Professor Anders Walker said in an email about Newman’s statement. ""Machine guns are controlled by federal law, full stop,"" and linked to a Giffords Law Center webpage. An NRA spokeswoman agreed. Kevin Jamison, attorney and president of the Western Missouri Shooters Alliance, pointed to the fact that no state agency regulates machine guns, and said that the only difference is that the Missouri law allows prosecutors to try a case in a Missouri court. ""Doesn’t happen very often, but it could possibly happen,"" Jamison said. Newman also said, ""Ever since (House Bill 294 passed), continually my whole time in the Legislature, we have loosened restriction."" Experts said the accuracy of Newman’s statement depends on whether she was referring to machine guns specifically or gun laws in general. When it comes to machine guns, experts said Missouri has not loosened restrictions since 2011. However, Shearer pointed out that the state has loosened restriction on gun laws more generally. ""Rep. Newman is also correct that Missouri has weakened its gun laws over time, including last year, when state lawmakers overrode the governor’s veto to enact permitless concealed carry,"" Shearer said. ""Missouri’s weak laws correlate with a comparatively high gun death rate. In 2016 Missouri had the ninth highest per capita gun death rate among all the states,"" pointing to a Giffords Law Center scorecard. Newman said, Missouri legalized machine guns. There’s some truth to that, but also some caveats. In 2011, the Missouri legislature overturned a full ban of automatic weapons. But all that did was make state law comply with federal law. Federal law doesn’t outright ban machine guns, but it does heavily regulate them. Generally, machine guns are hard to acquire",Half True,"November 3, 2017"
"""People who die from a home invasion make up a sad but minuscule .04% of all gun murders in the U.S. And over a third of them are killed by their own gun that the criminal has either stolen or wrestled from them.""","Documentary filmmaker Michael Moore’s response to the mass shooting in Las Vegas was to propose rewriting the Second Amendment, providing a laundry list of statistics to support his arguments for increased gun control. Moore suggested his ""proposed 28th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution"" in an Oct. 4, 2017, Facebook post, three days after a gunman killed 58 and wounded 489 in a massacre at a Las Vegas country music festival. His recommendations included limiting the number of bullets a firearm magazine may hold, banning all automatic and semi-automatic guns, and storing guns outside of the home. ""People who die from a home invasion make up a sad but minuscule .04 percent of all gun murders in the US. And over a third of them are killed by their own gun that the criminal has either stolen or wrestled from them,"" Moore wrote. Polling shows that self-defense is the top reason most gun owners purchase their weapons, but we wondered whether Moore’s numbers were right. Do homicides during home invasions comprise 0.04 percent of all gun deaths in the United States? And are a third of those people killed with their own weapon? We attempted to contact Moore to learn what sources he used, but didn’t hear back. The figures we found in both cases are difficult to confirm, even for the experts. Problem No. 1: The term ""home invasion"" isn’t necessarily used in crime-tracking data. Broadly, the term usually describes a break-in at a residence while the people who live there are present, or more specifically, when someone breaks into a home to rob or hurt the residents. Some jurisdictions use it and some don’t, but there is no universal definition or dataset. What would be called a home invasion is often reclassified as the eventual crime committed by the suspect — a robbery, a physical attack or so forth. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Violent Death Reporting System tracks the location, weapon and crime being committed at the time of a violent death. But there’s no distinction about whether it was during a home invasion, or with the victim’s own firearm. The Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Uniform Crime Report and its Supplementary Homicide Report, which compile data voluntarily provided by local law enforcement agencies, track the number of homicides and whether another crime was being committed. Home invasion is not a specific category, however. Several experts on firearm statistics told us they hadn’t seen a recent study on either home invasions ending in homicide or who owned the weapon used, but Moore’s first point sounded somewhat reasonable. ""Every year, there are about 100 burglary homicides in the U.S. If half of these were gun homicides, he would be in the right ballpark,"" University of Chicago Crime Lab co-director Harold Pollack said. ""So the statistic isn’t wildly off base, but I haven’t seen a rigorous analysis. There’s no question that lethal home invasions are terrifying but rare events."" When we checked 2015 FBI figures, for example, there were 13,455 reported homicides, and 102 of those happened during burglaries. That’s 0.76 percent of all homicides — but there was no mention of the term home invasion, or the weapon used to commit the homicide. It turns out there is one study that did come close to defining things the way Moore did, but Moore overstated the reported figure. A 2010 report from the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics noted that ""between 2003 and 2007, approximately 2.1 million household burglaries were reported to the FBI each year on average. Household burglaries ending in homicide made up 0.004% of all burglaries during that period."" That’s about 86 people killed during a burglary annually, but the 0.004 percent is from all burglaries, not just ones classified as home invasions. Furthermore, the report’s 0.004 percent is 10 times less than the 0.04 percent figure Moore stated. The study also does not specify a gun was the murder weapon, but rather counts every homicide regardless of how it was committed. Shannan Catalano, a statistician at the Bureau of Justice Statistics, said the datapoint was actually only a side note in her larger report from 2010, but showed how few homicide-related burglaries there were overall. Moore appeared to take the figure from her study, she said, but for some reason got the percentage wrong. Catalano suggested it may have been a typographical error, but had no way of knowing Moore’s intent. Catalano’s broader study used data from her agency’s National Crime Victimization Survey, which uses statistical samples from a cross-section of addresses around the United States to estimate crimes. She said she will update the study in 2018, using the National Incident Based Reporting System. Like everyone else we contacted, Catalano also did not know of a statistic that supported Moore’s second assertion about a third of people being killed with their own gun during these attacks at home. Several studies show owning a firearm greatly increases the risk of unintentional gun-related deaths. Philip Cook, a public policy professor at Duke University, said if a statistic showing people killed by their own weapon in home burglaries exists, it’s not widely known. ""I’m quite sure that it’s not part of any of the standard databases,"" Cook said. ""So it must be a one-time study by someone, probably of limited scope."" Moore said, ""People who die from a home invasion make up a sad but minuscule .04 percent of all gun murders in the U.S. And over a third of them are killed by their own gun that the criminal has either stolen or wrestled from them."" While Moore has a point that guns are rarely used when someone breaks into a home, it is difficult to confirm. After interviewing several experts and agencies, we only found one study that came close to supporting Moore’s assertion about the number of home invasion deaths. Even then, the report’s author said Moore misstated the scope and specifics. Our sources conceded that the homicide rate during burglaries is a tiny fraction of overall gun deaths, committed during burglaries or otherwise. But none of them, including federal agencies that track crime, could independently verify Moore’s figures about the owner of the weapon used in those crimes the way he claimed",Mostly False,"October 25, 2017"
"""Background checks have been unequivocally shown to reduce gun violence.""","On the heels of the Las Vegas shooting, two military veterans-turned-congressmen waded into the debate over the country’s response to gun violence. Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., a former Marine, appeared with Rep. Scott Taylor, R-Va., a former Navy SEAL, on ABC’s This Week Oct. 8 to discuss issues surrounding gun control and the Second Amendment. As the conversation turned toward background checks, Taylor argued the measure doesn’t necessarily help reduce gun violence. ""Actually,"" Moulton countered, ""background checks have been unequivocally shown to reduce gun violence."" We previously found that around 90 percent of Americans support background checks on every gun sale. While the belief that background checks reduce gun violence appears firmly ingrained, we found that proving the theory — especially ""unequivocally,"" which means without a doubt — is not so clear cut. Moulton’s office pointed us to research by the gun control advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety that explored the relationship between background check laws and gun violence rates. Under federal law, background checks are not required for private sales. But 19 states and D.C. have laws on the books that require some sort of background check on private sales of at least some types of private guns. Everytown for Gun Safety compared the rates of gun violence in states that require background checks for private sales to states that do not. They compared the fatality rates along several categories: women shot to death by intimate partners, suicides by gun and law enforcement officers shot and killed in the line of duty. The group found that states with comprehensive background checks had a roughly 50 percent lower rate in each category:  But experts told us that while stark differences between the two groups of states is noteworthy, it should not be taken as unequivocal proof that background checks reduce gun violence. Philip J. Cook, a professor of public policy studies at Duke University and gun control expert, said the comparisons do not control for all of the other variables that may differ between the two groups of states, like relative levels of gun ownership. ""No reasonable person could believe that universal background checks could, all by themselves, cut these rates of gun violence in half,"" he said. Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, said that without controlling for other factors, the data is insufficient for concluding a cause-and-effect relationship about background checks and a reduced gun violence. Moulton’s office also pointed us to research by Webster and several colleagues. The study looked at the effects that a Connecticut law requiring handgun purchasers to get a license had on subsequent homicides. Under the Connecticut law, a prospective handgun buyer had to clear an application process that included a background check to obtain a 5-year license to buy handguns (the law did not not apply to rifles and shotguns). Measures such as the Connecticut law are known in academic circles as ""permit-to-purchase laws."" Researchers found the Connecticut law was associated with a 40 percent reduction in gun homicides between 1996 and 2005. They determined this by comparing Connecticut’s homicide rates after the law went into effect to rates that would have been expected if the law was never passed, an estimate referred to as ""Synthetic Connecticut"" in the graph below (we’d note this methodology was not without some controversy). Researchers also discovered the large drop in homicides was found only in gun-related killings, not homicides caused by other means, which suggests the law was the driving force behind the reduction.  But Webster cautioned that the associated reduction in gun violence could not be attributed solely to background checks, because they were part of a larger regulatory scheme under Connecticut’s permit-to-purchase law. The law required all would-be gun buyers to apply for a permit in person with the local police before making a purchase, regardless of whether the seller was a licensed dealer or private seller. The law also raised the legal age to buy a handgun from 18 to 21 years and obliged would-be purchasers to undergo at least eight hours in a gun safety training course. It also criminalized the sale of a handgun to anyone without a license. Webster said the effects of comprehensive background checks alone couldn’t be de-coupled from the other law’s other provisions. ""Just passing a comprehensive background check law — without other measures relevant to standards for legal gun ownership and accountability and without commitment to really enforce the comprehensive background check laws — may not be sufficient to reduce gun violence if there is not concerted effort to enforce the law,"" Webster said. ""Bottom line,"" he said, ""comprehensive background checks laws saved lives, but when coupled with permit-to-purchase laws."" Experts we spoke to appeared to agree Moulton was partially right, but overstated the case. According to his reading of the scientific literature, Webster said background checks on all gun transfers are necessary to stop prohibited people from getting guns. But it hasn’t been established scientifically that background checks could do so alone, separate from a broader system of laws and regulations, he said. ""The best evidence for impact on mortality rates is when comprehensive background checks is coupled with permit-to-purchase law requirements,"" Webster said. ""The impact of these laws depends on the legal standards for gun ownership, systems having necessary records and whether the laws are actually enforced."" David Hemenway, a professor of health policy at Harvard University who has written extensively about firearms policy, said he tends to agree with the general thrust of Moulton’s claim, but believes ""unequivocally"" is too strong a word. ""Stronger gun laws and fewer guns are associated, all else equal, with lower rates of gun violence,"" Hemenway said. ""Among all the gun laws, there is probably the best evidence that background checks help reduce gun violence. A handful of studies find that they appear to reduce interpersonal firearm violence (and gun trafficking)."" Cook also said research into the relationship between background checks and gun violence is less clear cut than Moulton suggested. ""The true state of play in the scientific literature is somewhat equivocal,"" he said. Moulton said, ""Background checks have been unequivocally shown to reduce gun violence."" Research has shown background checks to be associated with reduced gun violence, and they’re believed to be a necessary measure to stop guns from falling into the wrong hands. But it hasn’t been scientifically established that background checks alone could reduce violence, separate from a broader system of laws, regulations and enforcement.

"""There have been more than 270 mass shootings in the United States in the last year alone. That’s where four or more are killed.""","Citing the Las Vegas shooting that killed 59 people and injured hundreds, Hillary Clinton urged the nation to do more to prevent gun violence during a speech at the University of California at Davis on Monday. The Democrat and former presidential candidate rejected the idea that a debate over gun safety should wait until well after a mass shooting takes place. ""What better time than now?"" Clinton said, speaking on her current book tour’s only scheduled stop in California. Clinton went on to make a claim about the number of mass shootings that have taken place this year — and misstated how they are defined. ""There have been more than 270 mass shootings in the United States this year alone. That’s where four or more are killed. Two hundred and seventy. We cannot accept this as normal. We cannot become desensitized.""   Hillary Clinton made her claim about mass shootings during a speech Oct. 9, 2017 at UC Davis.  PolitiFact California took a deep look at how mass shootings are defined here, and found there’s wide disagreement on the matter. Democrats and gun control advocates use the very broad criteria that a mass shooting includes four or more people killed — or injured — in one event. It was developed by the Gun Violence Archive, a group that logs shootings across the country by crowdsourcing media reports. Under its definition, which does not require that anyone is necessarily killed, there have been more than 270 mass shootings so far this year. But there have been far fewer of these crimes where, as Clinton termed it, ""four or more people are killed."" More restrictive criteria A database compiled by Mother Jones, a liberal magazine, shows there have been only three mass shootings so far this year that meet the four-or-more measurement expressed by Clinton at the speech. The magazine itself shows seven mass shootings so far this year because it uses three or more deaths as its criteria. It excludes more conventional crimes such as armed robberies and gang violence in its count, focusing instead on ""the distinct phenomenon of mass shootings.""  The Gun Violence Archive, meanwhile, which includes gang shootings and home invasion robberies as mass shootings, had tallied 19 shootings in which four or more people were killed.  In the past, the federal government has used the more restrictive criteria of four or more killed to define a mass shooting. We found there’s no widely accepted definition that doesn’t create its own share of questions. A spokesman for Clinton pointed to the Gun Violence Archive’s definition for mass shootings, but did not immediately provide an explanation for Clinton’s misstatement of that definition. Our ruling Hillary Clinton in her UC Davis speech said there have been more than 270 mass shootings in the United States so far this year. She defined the events as ""where four or more are killed."" Our research has shown that a broad definition of mass shootings requires four or more people to be killed or injured. There have been more than 270 of those horrific crimes so far this year. But Clinton left out the key words ""or injured,"" dramatically changing the criteria for these shootings. There have been a much smaller number of mass shootings that meet this stricter criteria of ""four or more people killed,"" nowhere near the 270 she claimed",False,"October 10, 2017"
"Says Sen. Dianne Feinstein said ""if she had 51 votes in the Senate for 'Mr. and Ms. America, turn in all of your guns,' they would do it.""","Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., has offered a bill to ban bump fire stocks after police found 12 rifles equipped with these devices in the Las Vegas festival shooter’s hotel room. In a significant policy shift, Republicans and the National Rifle Association have said they believe that the government should intervene and regulate this kind of equipment, which allows semi-automatic weapons to fire over and over again without forcing the shooter to do all the work of squeezing the trigger repeatedly. On Fox News Sunday, NRA-Institute for Legislative Action executive director Chris Cox drew a sharp line between his group’s stance and what he sees as the underlying Democratic agenda. ""I take Dianne Feinstein at her word when she says that if she had 51 votes in the Senate for 'Mr. and Ms. America, turn in all of your guns,' they would do it,"" Cox told host Chris Wallace Oct. 8. Cox is off target, because he said Feinstein said she wanted to take away all guns. In reality, back in 1995, Feinstein said she wanted to take away all assault rifles. That’s a huge difference. While firm numbers are lacking, assault weapons represent a fraction of the country’s estimated total of 310 million guns. We reached out to the National Rifle Association and did not hear back, but Cox was repeating a charge that has been leveled against Feinstein before. In the past, it tracked back to an interview she did in 1995. Feinstein was a driving force behind the 1994 federal assault weapons ban. It prohibited the manufacture of 19 specific kinds of military-style, semi-automatic firearms, often called assault weapons. Those restrictions did not apply to any semi-automatic weapons made before the ban’s effective date Sept. 13, 1994. (Congress allowed the ban to expire in 2004.) In a Feb. 5, 1995 segment on CBS News’ 60 Minutes, correspondent Lesley Stahl explored the surge in sales that preceded the ban. Stahl cited government estimates that as many 1.5 million weapons were in circulation due to the exception carved out in the law. Stahl said Feinstein told him in an interview that she didn’t want that, but had done the best that should could. ""If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban, picking up every one of them, ‘Mr. and Mrs. America, turn ‘em all in,’ I would have done it,"" Feinstein told Stahl. ""I could not do that. The votes weren’t here."" Feinstein repeated that message in a speech on the Senate floor a few months later: ""If I had my way, I would ban the possession of assault weapons anywhere in the United States of America, but there were not going to be the votes for that. This is a moderate law."" Her words have always applied to assault weapons, not all firearms. In a 2012 op-ed, she wrote ""Let me be clear: If an individual wants to purchase a weapon for hunting or self-defense, I support that right."" And in proposing to ban bump stocks, Feinstein said her bill ""does not take anyone's gun."" She also said she remains committed to some form of a ban on semiautomatic assault weapons. Both the total number of firearms and assault-style weapons in the country remain unclear. According to a Congressional Research Service report, in 2009, the country had about 310 million firearms: ""114 million handguns, 110 million rifles, and 86 million shotguns."" In 2013, pro-Second Amendment rights attorney David Hardy said in Senate testimony that nearly 9 million people went target shooting with an AR-15-style weapon. (AR-15 refers to one of the more common styles of the banned weapons.) Hardy used figures from the National Shooting Sports Foundation that showed in 2012 that only about a quarter of shooters owned an AR-style weapon. Based on that, 9 million would be a high-end estimate of the number of assault weapons owned in 2012. Set against a total number of firearms in excess of 300 million, assault weapons are not a large share of all guns. Cox said that Feinstein had once said ""if she had 51 votes in the Senate for 'Mr. and Ms. America , turn in all of your guns,' they would do it."" This is an inaccurate characterization of what Feinstein said in a 1995 interview on assault-type weapons. It is clear in context about loopholes in the 1994 assault weapon ban that Feinstein would have liked the ban to apply to all assault weapons but did not have the votes. That is a far cry from banning all firearms, and Feinstein has said she supports the right of people to own a weapon for hunting or self-defense",False,"October 8, 2017"
"""The Obama administration approved the sale of bump fire stocks on at least two occasions.""","In a rare move, the National Rifle Association issued a statement calling for regulation of the device that turned the Las Vegas shooter’s rifles more deadly, blaming Barack Obama’s administration for its approval. ""Despite the fact that the Obama administration approved the sale of bump fire stocks on at least two occasions, the National Rifle Association is calling on the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to immediately review whether these devices comply with federal law,"" the NRA wrote in a statement. ""The NRA believes that devices designed to allow semiautomatic rifles to function like fully-automatic rifles should be subject to additional regulations."" A bump or fire stock is a device that allows rifles to fire bullets as quickly as a machine gun. At least 12 of the Las Vegas shooter’s guns were outfitted with them. But did Obama approve their legality? Sort of, but approved is probably the wrong word. NRA spokeswoman Amy Hunter pointed us to a June 2010 approval letter from ATF, an agency under executive purview, sent to Slide Fire, a bump stock manufacturer. Spelling out the legal definition of a firearm, ATF’s technology chief John Spencer determined it was not regulated by law. ""The stock has no automatically functioning mechanical parts or springs and performs no automatic mechanical function when installed,"" Spencer wrote. ""Accordingly, we find that the ‘bump-stock’ is a firearm part and is not regulated as a firearm under Gun Control Act or the National Firearms Act."" Bump stocks harness a weapon’s recoil to cause the user’s finger to squeeze the trigger repeatedly, but because they don’t alter the gun’s internal mechanisms, they were considered lawful. We found a similar 2012 letter addressed to Bump Fire, a competing manufacturer. But just as these bump stocks didn’t qualify for regulation, two similar devices did. The difference? The Akins Accelerator and the Autoglove were determined in 2007 and 2017, respectively, to have mechanical parts that enhanced the trigger mechanism, making them by definition machineguns. ""Electrically-driven trigger devices are considered ‘machineguns’ because they are a ‘combination of parts designed and intended, for use in converting a weapon into a machinegun,’ "" ATF’s letter to AutoGlove read. Automatic weapons sales have been restricted since the 1934 National Firearms Act, and 1986 regulations made it much harder for civilians to get an automatic weapon like a machine gun. Experts in firearm policy were divided when we asked about the fairness of the NRA’s characterization. Adam Winkler, a law professor at University of California, Los Angeles, who specializes in guns, said it was appropriate to characterize the move as an approval of its sale under the Obama administration. ""Not because they liked it, but because the law did not permit them to prohibit it,"" Winkler said. Other legal experts stressed that it wasn’t an approval, but rather a determination that current law didn’t allow for its regulation. ""The statement implies Obama or (U.S. Attorney General Eric) Holder was somehow involved, and that it was an issue that wouldn’t have been approved in any other administration, and that’s technically incorrect,"" said Rick Vasquez, a former Firearms Technology Branch official who first signed off on the recommendation the ATF could not regulate the Slide Fire. ""We never had any political people come down to our office saying we must or must not approve (the Slide Fire),"" Vasquez said. Obama issued a slew of executive orders promoting stricter gun control, which the Trump administration has been rolling back, including a measure that previously prevented people with mental illness from buying guns. ""I believe (the NRA) were stating that just to point out that this wasn’t some rogue decision made during a Republican administration, which would be more friendly to gun owners, and therefore that when they re-evaluate it, they’re going to have to take a really close look at the law,"" said John Pierce, a lawyer and advocate for gun rights. In order to re-evaluate the bump stock, Vasquez said the ATF would have to change the way it interpreted the National Firearms Act or issue new legislation that would allow the device to be regulated. The NRA said, ""The Obama administration approved the sale of bump fire stocks on at least two occasions."" We indeed found two occasions in which ATF, a bureau within the executive branch, decided it could not regulate bump stocks during the Obama administration. These decisions allowed two companies to sell bump stocks. It’s important to note this was not a statement of Obama’s preferred policy, which called for more regulation of guns, but was what the agency determined it had to do under the language of current law",Mostly True,"October 6, 2017"

Chris Taylor made a claim about a bill that’s advancing in the Wisconsin Legislature. The Madison Democrat said on Oct. 4, 2017, three days after the shooting: Unfortunately, the other thing that we see after these horrible massacres is a loosening of gun laws, allowing dangerous individuals to get firearms more easily. That seems to be the trend in this country. Right here, in our own state, we have a bill that would allow hidden, deadly weapons -- every single person to carry one -- no training, no background check, even around schools -- even around schools. Let’s see if that’s what the bill would do. The bill’s history and status Taylor was referring to Senate Bill 169, which was introduced by two GOP lawmakers in April 2017. In September 2017, 11 days before a gunman killed 58 people and wounded 489 in Las Vegas, the bill was approved by a Senate committee. The three Republicans voted yes and the two Democrats no. The full Senate could take up the bill later in 2017 or in 2018. Both the state Senate and the Assembly are controlled by Republicans. But GOP Gov. Scott Walker has cast some doubt on the legislation, saying in June 2017 it was ""appropriate"" for the state to require people to get permits to carry hidden weapons. The bill vs. current law To be clear, under current state law, certain people, such as felons, are prohibited from possessing a gun. Generally speaking, it is legal in Wisconsin to openly carry a firearm without any training or license to carry. But a state license is needed to carry a concealed firearm. Now let’s get to how concealed carry would change under the bill, according a memo by the nonpartisan Legislative Council and Larry Konopacki, the state attorney who wrote it: Licensing: Currently, it is generally illegal in Wisconsin to carry a concealed weapon unless you have a concealed carry weapon (CCW) license issued by the state. A background check and training are required to get a license. The bill would do away with the licensing requirement -- which means no training or background check would be required to carry a concealed weapon. So, the ""no training, no background check"" part of Taylor’s claim is correct. Schools: Currently, guns are generally prohibited on school grounds. The bill would do away with that blanket prohibition. Instead, individual schools could ban guns on their grounds. But people with a CCW license would still be able to bring their guns on the grounds, as long as the guns stayed in their vehicle or within five feet of their vehicle. (The provision was included so that parents who carry weapons aren’t breaking the law when they pick up and drop off their children at school, supporters say.) Those with licenses would also be free to bring guns onto any school grounds when there were no school activities. But Taylor’s claim was ""around schools,"" so let’s be clear on that. Currently, only CCW license holders are generally allowed to possess firearms within 1,000 feet of school grounds. Under the bill, anyone who legally possesses a firearm could generally carry within 1,000 feet of school grounds.   It's worth noting that while carrying within 1,000 feet of school would be made legal under state law, generally speaking, people would still be in violation of federal law if carrying a concealed weapon within 1,000 feet from a school if they don't have a concealed carry license. Prohibitions: Currently, it is generally illegal for certain persons -- such as people convicted of any felony, or of a misdemeanor involving domestic violence -- to possess a gun at all. The bill would not change that general prohibition. However, it would allow even those people who are generally prohibited to be able to legally carry, open or concealed, antique, replica and muzzleloading firearms. So, to Taylor’s claim, even felons could concealed carry those certain types of firearms and they could do so within 1,000 feet of a school. Our rating Taylor said in Wisconsin, ""we have a bill that would allow hidden, deadly weapons -- every single person to carry one -- no training, no background check, even around schools."" The ""every single person"" part of the claim needs clarification, in that not every person, particularly felons, can legally possess any type of weapon. But Taylor is correct that if the bill becomes law, people could generally carry concealed weapons without getting a license -- which would mean no background check or training would be required, either. And even felons could conceal carry certain weapons, such as antique or replica guns. As for around schools, anyone who can legally possess a firearm could generally carry it concealed within 1,000 feet of a school, under the bill",Mostly True,"October 6, 2017"
"""White men have committed more mass shootings than any other group.""","As details about the Las Vegas shooter’s identity emerged, media outlets noted some of the characteristics fit neatly within a familiar profile of prior mass shooting perpetrators. Newsweek, for instance, ran a story with the headline, ""White men have committed more mass shootings than any other group."" The article builds on this claim, stating that 54 percent of mass shootings carried out since 1982 were done so by white males. We’ve covered the demographics of mass shootings before but had not heard this specific claim. So we decided to take a closer look at who’s behind mass shootings. No U.S. government entity specifically tracks mass shootings — much less, the shooters’ race and ethnicity, experts told us. But some media organizations and nongovernmental groups have taken up the task in various forms. Some of the differences in the datasets are the result of having no universally accepted definition of mass shooting. The number of mass shootings a group tallies can vary dramatically based on how the term is defined. For example, the Gun Violence Archive, a nonprofit organization that tracks gun-related injuries and deaths, defines a mass shooting as ""four or more shot and/or killed in a single incident, at the same general time and location, not including the shooter."" According to that group, there have been 274 mass shootings so far this year, or nearly one per day. Another widely cited source comes from the progressive media outlet Mother Jones, which created a database in 2012 after the mass shooting at an Aurora, Colo., movie theater. Mother Jones defines a public mass shooting as an incident in which the motive appeared to be indiscriminate killing and a lone gunman took the lives of at least three people. This language is similar to a 2013 statute that defines ""mass killings"" as three or more killed in a single incident, though that applies to any weapon. The Mother Jones database, which dates back to Aug. 20, 1982, counts 91 mass shootings. Of these, 50 were carried out by white men — hence, where Newsweek and other outlets got the statistic that 54 percent of mass shootings carried out since 1982 were done so by white men. For comparison’s sake, Mother Jones' data show African-Americans accounted for 15 mass shootings, while Latinos and Asians were responsible for seven each. Three attacks were carried out by women, including one of the two perpetrators behind the 2015 San Bernardino shooting. We should note that some experts expressed concern that if the public debate around gun violence focuses too much on mass shootings, there’s a risk of overlooking the fact that gun murders disproportionately affect minorities, especially African-Americans.  Because Newsweek’s claim derives from Mother Jones’ data, we asked experts about the reliability of this count. Grant Duwe, author of Mass Murder in the United States: A History, considered a leading scholarly book on the subject, has long criticized Mother Jones’ accounting. Duwe pointed us to an essay he penned for Reason magazine in 2014, in which he argued Mother Jones has low-balled its tally of mass shootings as a result of relying solely on news coverage as its source of data. Duwe believes this creates a false impression that mass shootings have been on the rise (a claim that’s beyond the scope of this fact-check). ""The main concern is an underreporting problem that gets worse the farther back in time we go,"" Duwe told PolitiFact. ""This creates problems when it comes to drawing conclusions about trends in the prevalence of mass public shootings."" Nevertheless, Duwe said his own research dating back to 1900 corroborates that white men have committed more mass shootings than any other group, though he believes white men make up an even larger share than the Mother Jones data show. ""There have been at least 184 mass public shootings in the U.S. since 1900, including the Las Vegas attack,"" Duwe said. ""Among these mass public shooters, non-Hispanic whites make up 63 percent, which is close to what we see for the U.S. population in general. So, the Mother Jones data actually underreport the extent to which whites are involved as mass public shooters."" The vast majority of mass shootings is committed by men. Looking only at the male population, some have argued that statistical claims based on Mother Jones data on the racial makeup of mass shooters leaves out important context. Critics argue that when you consider that non-Hispanic white men make up about 63 percent of the male population, white men appear proportionally less likely to commit a mass shooting, according to the Mother Jones statistics showing white men account for 54 percent of mass shootings. (Duwe’s finding that non-Hispanic white men make up 63 percent of mass shooters is roughly in line with the white portion of the male population. White men make up roughly 31 percent of the overall U.S. population.) Duwe defines ""mass public shooting"" as an incident that occurs in the absence of other criminal activity, in which a gun was used to kill four or more victims at a public location within a 24-hour period. Mother Jones national affairs editor Mark Follman praised Duwe’s dataset as valuable, but he pushed back on the notion that they’d underreported attacks, saying that to the best of his recollection some of the shootings Duwe flagged as deserving to be included in Mother Jones' database did not fit their criteria. He also said that while most of Mother Jones’ data is initially culled from media reports, they have also relied on primary source documents, interviews with law enforcement and tips from the public about more obscure cases going back further in time. For more on how the group calculated the frequency of mass shootings, he pointed us to a 2014 Mother Jones article claiming the rate of mass shootings tripled since 2011. Newsweek said, ""White men have committed more mass shootings than any other group."" Newsweek based its claim on data from Mother Jones, which defines a public mass shooting as an incident in which the motive appeared to be indiscriminate killing and a lone gunman took the lives of at least three people. Under this definition, Mother Jones found that non-Hispanic white men have been responsible for 54 percent of mass shootings since August 1982. Another tally, with a longer timeline and a different definition of mass shooting, found non-Hispanic white men make up 63 percent of these attacks. Under both definitions and datasets, white men have committed more mass shootings than any other ethnicity group. Newsweek's claim is literally accurate. But it's worth noting the imprecision of this data, and the percentage of mass shootings by white men is lower than their share of the male population, according to Mother Jones",Mostly True,"October 6, 2017"
"Says the Dickey Amendment ""prevents the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from even researching the relationship between gun violence and public health. ... The government can’t study gun violence but is spending $400,000 analyzing the effects of Swedish massages on rabbits.""","The mass shooting in Las Vegas prompted former Democratic Congressman Steve Israel of New York to write that these horrific events have little impact on public policy. In a New York Times op-ed, Israel walked through a list of shootings -- the murder of 26 children and adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in 2012, the June 2016 mass shooting in an Orlando nightclub, and others -- and noted that despite the hand-wringing after each one, nothing changed. Israel said Democrats were unable to enact reforms, including ""our attempts to rescind the infamous Dickey Amendment, which prevents the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from even researching the relationship between gun violence and public health."" ""The result?"" Israel wrote Oct. 2. ""The government can’t study gun violence but is spending $400,000 analyzing the effects of Swedish massages on rabbits."" There are two elements to sift through here: Does the Dickey Amendment block government research into gun violence and public health? And is Washington studying Swedish massage on rabbits? In 1996, with strong support from the National Rifle Association, Congress included an amendment by Rep. Jay Dickey, R-Ark., in its omnibus spending bill. The amendment said ""none of the funds made available for injury prevention and control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may be used to advocate or promote gun control."" In the same bill, Congress pulled $2.8 million aimed at gun injury research and assigned it elsewhere in the CDC. Ever since, Washington and the CDC have steered clear of funding research that could run afoul of that amendment. Israel said the provision prevents government-funded studies of the ties between guns and public health, but plenty of people say the rule is not binding. Dickey himself joined with the former head of the CDC’s National Center for Injury Prevention and Control Mark Rosenberg to challenge that long-held assumption. ""We believe strongly that funding for research into gun-violence prevention should be dramatically increased,"" they wrote in a 2016 public letter. ""We do not see the congressional language against using federal funds ‘to promote or advocate gun control’ as a barrier to this research."" An article on the Harvard Law Petrie-Flom Center blog argued that the amendment bars research aimed at promoting gun control and not all research. U.S. Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., echoed that point in a letter to the CDC, saying the meaning had been ""misconstrued."" But that belief had its own consequences. ""As a result, public health researchers at the CDC and other federal agencies have been discouraged from conducting scientific research on gun violence,"" Carper wrote March 17, 2016. ""Although the CDC self-directs a portion of its nearly $6.2 billion annual budget to a wide variety of intra- and extramural research, the CDC has been reluctant to devote funding to gun violence research without a specific appropriation from Congress."" Carper offered proof that the Dickey Amendment can co-exist with government gun violence studies. He noted that in 2015, the CDC assessed the causes of a rise in gun violence in Wilmington, Del. In general, the impact of the Dickey Amendment is more political than legal. Research could move forward, but without an explicit signoff from Congress, there’s been limited activity. After the 2012 Newtown slayings, President Barack Obama directed the CDC to conduct or fund research into the causes of gun violence. The impact was modest. ""As far as I can tell the CDC still correctly believes that gun research, or even mentioning guns, is too hot to handle,"" said director of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center David Hemenway. Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research director Daniel Webster also said there’s been no new funding from CDC or the National Institutes of Health. Rosenberg told us, ""The research scientists at CDC are very anxious to do this research, but the recent directors of CDC have been willing to let this eminently solvable problem fester because they fear that the NRA will prod Congress into cutting public health programs that are viewed as more central and critical to CDC's mission."" As for the $400,000 spent on studying the effects of Swedish massages on rabbits that Israel mentioned, yes, the government did that. (The exact amount was closer to $387,000.) It gave the Ohio State University Sports Medicine Center money to build a small device that mimics the action of Swedish massage to see if the treatment reduced pain and inflammation. Rabbits were the test subjects. The treatment helped, by the way. Researchers found that with the right mix of force, duration and frequency, there was ""maximal recovery of muscle and joint function."" However, there’s an issue of timing with Israel’s statement. He said the government is currently spending money on this research. In fact, the study ended in 2014. Israel spokesman Harrison Feuer didn’t argue that detail. ""The larger point that Congressman Israel was looking to accurately make is that the government has funded studies into various endeavors that are less impactful than guns on public health,"" Feuer said. Israel said the Dickey Amendment prevents the CDC from researching the relationship between gun violence and public health. As a matter of law, it only prevents money going toward research aimed at promoting gun control. But as a matter of politics, that distinction is murky, and as a result, research has been limited. Israel’s point about Swedish massage on rabbits is off on the timing, but right on the substance. Israel’s statement has some technical flaws, but the broader thrust is accurate",Mostly True,"October 5, 2017"
"The Las Vegas shooting was the ""273rd mass shooting"" in the United States so far in 2017.","In an email released to reporters on Oct. 3, 2017, U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin lamented the mass shooting in Las Vegas two days earlier, calling it ""the 273rd mass shooting this year."" There’s no question it was a massacre: A lone gunman perched high in a hotel suite killed 59 people, including a Wisconsin native, who had gathered for an outdoor country music concert. More than 500 people were injured. But have there really been 273 mass shootings in the United States so far in 2017, as the Wisconsin Democrat says? What a ‘mass shooting’ is SFGate.com, which is associated with the San Francisco Chronicle, reported that on the morning after the Las Vegas incident, many news media and social media users were calling it the 273rd mass shooting of the year. But the actual number depends on the source being cited. Here’s a look at two counts as of Oct. 3, 2017 that reveal two extremes: Source Mass shooting definition Count of 2017 mass shootings Gun Violence Archive, nonprofit organization Four or more shot and/or killed in a single incident, at the same general time and location, not including the shooter. 273 Mother Jones, liberal magazine A single attack in a public place in which three or more victims were killed.  7 Baldwin was relying on the Gun Violence Archive figure, her campaign told us. (The first-term senator is up for re-election in 2018.) For an idea of how broadly the archive views mass shootings, here are the circumstances of the two incidents that occurred before the Las Vegas shooting, according to news reports: A shooting in Memphis, Tenn., was believed to be the result of someone bringing a gun to a fight. A shooting in Lawrence, Kan., occurred in a street during a fight involving a number of people. There are other definitions of mass shootings, as well, including some that have produced much lower counts. The non-profit Everytown for Gun Safety -- counting incidents in which four or more people were shot and killed, not including the shooter -- said there were 156 mass shootings from 2009 through 2016. That’s an average of 19.5 per year. The Washington Post counted 131 events in which four or more people were killed by a lone shooter (or two shooters in three cases), dating back to the University of Texas tower killings in 1966. That’s an average of less than three mass shootings per year. The Post didn’t count gang killings, shootings that began as other crimes such as robberies, and killings that involved only the shooter’s family. The point is: There is no universally accepted definition of mass shooting. Indeed, we’ve run into this before. Almost exactly two years before Baldwin made her claim, U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, D-Fla., said that at that point in 2015 there had been 294 mass shootings. That number also came from the Gun Violence Archive",Half True,"October 4, 2017"
"""The crowd (in Las Vegas) fled at the sound of gunshots. Imagine the deaths if the shooter had a silencer ...""","In the wake of the Las Vegas shooting, Hillary Clinton suggested gun silencers could have amplified the bloodshed. ""The crowd fled at the sound of gunshots. Imagine the deaths if the shooter had a silencer, which the NRA wants to make easier to get,"" Clinton tweeted. The crowd fled at the sound of gunshots. Imagine the deaths if the shooter had a silencer, which the NRA wants to make easier to get. A silencer is the popular name for a suppressor, a canister attached to a gun muzzle that reduces (but doesn’t entirely silence) the sound produced by a gunshot. Some members of Congress have been pushing for legislation that would make it easier for gun owners to use suppressors. The Hearing Protection Act, introduced in the House of Representatives in January, would lower the restrictions on buying suppressors. As it stands, there is an approximately nine-month approval process and a $200 tax stamp. Act proponents want to streamline purchases to match regular firearm purchases. We wondered whether introducing suppressors to the Las Vegas shooting would have indeed increased casualties. Our research shows that a suppressor would not have made a difference in the Las Vegas case, because of the positioning of the weapons and because of the distance of the shooter from the crowd. Clinton’s staff provided no evidence to suggest a different outcome. A shooting weapon produces two sounds. One is the crack of the bullet, which can be heard on most video recordings of the shooting and is produced by the bullet traveling faster than the speed of sound. This is unaffected by suppressors. Suppressors instead work on the muzzle blast, or the sound the gun barrel produces when it fires. A typical gunshot is around 150-160 decibels, a level that can cause hearing damage. Suppressors can reduce that sound by around 20-30 decibels, depending on the gun, ammunition, temperature and even humidity. That’s just below the threshold for instant hearing damage. Experts compared the suppressed sound levels to a jackhammer and a jumbo jet on the tarmac 100 yards away. That’s still fairly loud. It’s important to note that suppressors are intended to lower the sound for the shooter, not the target. Jeremy Mallette, who has researched suppressors for Silencer Shop, estimated the sound of suppressed gunfire would go up 10 to 15 decibels downrange -- making the impact of the suppressor even lower for those on the receiving end. The gunman shot at the crowd out of windows on the 32nd floor of the hotel and positioned the guns so that they shot outwards. If the shooter’s aim was to lower the sound emissions, the room could have better trapped the noise, according to Tom Satterly, the director of development for Asymmetric Solutions, a firearm training firm based in Missouri. ""If you hang your weapon outside of your window the muzzle blast is going outside,"" Satterly said. ""If you back in -- a foot or farther -- a lot of that sound is absorbed into the room. That’s what snipers do when they’re trying to hide their position."" Suppressed or not, Mallette said adjacent hotel rooms would have heard the sound very loudly. Marty Langley, a gun-control advocate and a senior policy analyst at Violence Policy Center, pointed to claims from the silencer industry that if the suppressor masks the sound of the gunshot, then the person being shot at can only hear the ballistic crack after it has whizzed by, causing them to think the fire is coming from the opposite direction. However, Satterly, an Army veteran with combat experience in Somalia, said that neither he nor his colleagues had ever been able to pinpoint the direction the sound originated from -- an effect that is amplified in a loud, urban area like the Las Vegas strip. ""It’s nearly impossible to tell where someone shot you from in an urban environment unless there’s visual cues,"" Satterly said. Which brings us to our next point: Langley also pointed out claims from the industry that silencers make shooters less detectable in the dark. The flash hider that comes with a silencer is designed to minimize the flame the shooter sees coming out of the barrel, which can blind night vision goggles for a couple of seconds. But while it minimizes the flash, it doesn’t eliminate it altogether. What’s more, it’s a function that can be performed by tools that are already on the market without the same barriers to purchase as suppressors -- and that many rifles are already equipped with. Langley also pointed out industry claims that silencers can improve accuracy and enable quicker follow-up shots by reducing recoil. That is, they can decrease the barrel’s rising produced by the pressure and gas of the bullet. Experts agreed a suppressor can slightly improve accuracy, but the effect would have been minimal in the indiscriminate shooting seen in Las Vegas. Hillary Clinton suggested gun silencers would have worsened the Las Vegas attack in a tweet. It’s certainly possible that silencers or suppressors could make some shootings worse than they would be otherwise. But the specifics of the Las Vegas shooting don’t fit that scenario. Experts told us it’s highly unlikely a silencer would have made the Las Vegas shooting even more deadly, because of the distance of the shooter from the crowds and because of the crowded, urban environment where the victims were targeted. Gun silencers can slightly lower the visual and sound impact of a shooter, but experts agreed the impact would have been negligible in the case of Las Vegas",False,"October 4, 2017"
"""I think if you look to Chicago, where you had over 4,000 victims of gun-related crimes last year, they have the strictest gun laws in the country. That certainly hasn’t helped there.""","Facing questions from reporters on Oct. 2 about whether the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history would stir action on gun control, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders called up a page straight from the campaign playbook of her boss. ""I think if you look to Chicago, where you had over 4,000 victims of gun-related crimes last year, they have the strictest gun laws in the country. That certainly hasn’t helped there,"" Sanders said. ""So, I think we have to, when that time comes for those conversations to take place, then I think we have to look at things that may actually have a real impact."" Sanders’ statement was nearly identical to that of her boss nearly a year ago. During his third debate with Hillary Clinton in October 2016, Donald Trump used Chicago to bolster his belief in the folly of fighting gun crime with stricter gun laws. ""In Chicago, which has the toughest gun laws in the United States, probably you could say by far, they have more gun violence than any other city,"" Trump said. Trump was correct that Chicago’s gun violence led the nation. But a check by PolitiFact Illinois revealed that he was wrong by a long shot about the city having ""the toughest gun laws in the United States."" Just about anyone who follows crime trends and gun regulations in the U.S. with any degree of seriousness knows by now that the ""Chicago-as-gun-law-Mecca"" charge is a canard that lost its last vestige of credibility more than four years ago, when Illinois became the last state in the nation to allow concealed carry of firearms. Trump, following the rhetoric lead of many other strong gun rights advocates, has over the years frequently pointed to Chicago as ""proof"" that gun ownership restrictions not only fail to reduce crime, but exacerbate it. The most stringent gun laws in the U.S. happen to be in Chicago - and look what is happening there! Sanders took Trump’s illogical and invalid argument a step further. Now Chicago’s handgun ownership history proves that mass shootings committed with automatic weapons can’t be prevented with legal restrictions. Here’s why Sanders and all of those who continue to repeat her statement on social media and elsewhere are wrong about Chicago’s gun laws. Chicago’s reputation for strict gun laws is rooted in its 1982 ban on handguns. When the U.S. Supreme Court’s District of Columbia vs. Heller  decision in 2008 struck down a similar ban in the District of Columbia, Chicago was the only major city left with a blanket handgun prohibition. The distinction didn’t last long. In 2010, the high court followed up Heller with a ruling in McDonald vs. City of Chicago which nullified Chicago’s ban. At that, the concealed carry of firearms was still outlawed in Chicago as it was throughout all of Illinois. Two years later, however, the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals struck down the Illinois concealed carry ban as unconstitutional and the state soon after became the last in the nation to approve concealed carry. As we noted last year in fact-checking Trump’s Chicago-bashing: With that, Chicago lost its status -- or its stigma, depending on your perspective -- of having the strictest gun possession laws in the United States. In comparably sized big cities like New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco, the city administers the concealed-carry permitting process. In Illinois, the Illinois State Police processes applications, so it can be argued that Chicago has less autonomy in restricting concealed carry within its borders than do other cities. We also noted last year that the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, which advocates for stricter gun laws, found Illinois’ firearm laws too lenient in several ways, all of which still apply: Illinois’ gun laws still are considered among the most restrictive when compared with other states. The Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, which advocates for gun control, gives Illinois a B+ and ranks it No. 8 in the nation on its ""Smart Gun Laws"" report card. The group lauds Illinois for, among several rules, requiring firearm owners to obtain a Firearm Owners’ ID card that includes a background check and imposes a waiting period on firearm purchases. But it also knocks Illinois for not requiring registration of firearms, for its lack of restriction on the purchase of multiple firearms and for not allowing local jurisdictions to regulate firearms. In other words, Illinois could make its gun laws much more strict than they are. Seven states receive higher grades than Illinois in the latest Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence ratings. In last year’s fact-check, we noted that Trump’s statement also could have been interpreted as Chicago having strict gun laws because it imposed strict penalties on those who violate them or use guns in crimes. Even staunch gun rights advocates have argued that this approach can be an effective crime deterrent where restrictions on lawful gun ownership are both unconstitutional and ineffective. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel had for several years pushed unsuccessfully for a new state law containing harsher penalties for repeat gun offenders. A 2014 report by the Chicago Sun-Times found that lenient sentencing for gun offenders was a factor in repeat offenses. That was where things stood when Trump made his statement in 2016. That changed on June 23, when Gov. Bruce Rauner signed into law a bill that, among other things, increased the minimum sentence for repeat gun offenders from three to seven years. Thus even the argument that Chicago favors getting tough on lawful gun owners over cracking down on gun criminals no longer applies. Sanders, fielding questions about the impact of the Las Vegas massacre, pointed to chronic  gun violence in Chicago as proof that tough gun laws were ineffective. ""I think if you look to Chicago, where you had over 4,000 victims of gun-related crimes last year, they have the strictest gun laws in the country,"" she said. ""That certainly hasn’t helped there,"" There was a brief time between 2008 and 2010 -- the window during which Washington, D.C.’s handgun ban had been invalidated but Chicago’s still stood -- where that might have been true. But federal court rulings effectively undid city and state laws severely restricting gun use and ownership in the Chicago. When it comes to the concealed carry of weapons, Chicago has less authority to impose limitations than do many other large U.S. cities",Mostly False,"October 3, 2017"
"90 percent of Americans ""support universal background checks"" for gun purchases.","In the first hours after the Las Vegas mass shooting, many leading elected officials in Wisconsin issued statements about prayer and condolences, but Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele went further.

Elected officials must act. In 2015, we rated as True a claim that polling showed nearly 74 percent of National Rifle Association members support requiring background checks for all gun sales. The statement was made by Wisconsin state Sen. Lena Taylor, D-Milwaukee. So, what about Abele’s claim about all Americans? The latest polls and our checks with four polling experts indicate support is at 90 percent, give or take a few percentage points.

But well over 80 percent, and sometimes over 90 percent, of respondents favor background checks for all gun sales, he said. Polling experts Kathy Frankovic, a former consultant for CBS News, Karlyn Bowman at the American Enterprise Institute think tank and Charles Franklin at Marquette University Law School agreed that such results have been consistent. It’s worth noting that some other recent polls didn’t ask specifically about a background check for every gun sale, but they asked similar questions and got similar results: Pew Research Center (March 2017): ""Please indicate whether you would strongly favor, somewhat favor, somewhat oppose, or strongly oppose making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks.""

CNN/ORC (June 2016): ""Would you generally favor or oppose a background check on anyone attempting to purchase a gun in order to determine whether the prospective buyer has been convicted of a felony?""

"""Republicans want to restore #gunrights to felons""","Rep. José Serrano, D-Bronx, said legislation he’s against would allow convicted felons to own guns. That’s not allowed under federal law for most people with a felony. Serrano said a proposed amendment could change that. ""Now Republicans want to restore #gunrights to felons - something they lose after criminal conviction - CJS bills have prevented for 24 years,"" Serrano said in a tweet. Serrano was referring to a bill that allocates funds to the U.S. Departments of Justice, Commerce and other agencies. He explained his position when the amendment came up for a vote in the House. ""I rise in strong opposition to this very misguided amendment,"" Serrano said. ""This amendment would allow felons and other dangerous individuals to try to regain the ability to own guns by sending an application to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives."" The amendment was agreed to by a voice vote so there’s no record of who voted which way. The bill it’s tied to has passed the House, but not the Senate. Democrats and Republicans are typically divided when it comes to gun control. But would a Republican amendment allow felons to buy guns? The amendment Rep. Ken Buck, R-Colorado, sponsored the amendment. The amendment would give the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives funding to review applications from people who want to own a gun but legally can’t under federal law. People who have served more than a year in prison are among that group. A felony conviction typically comes with a minimum prison sentence of one year. Anyone convicted of a misdemeanor domestic violence charge or received a dishonorable discharge from the military is also not allowed to own a gun. The ATF has the power to restore gun rights to those people. Federal statute says the bureau may do so if they believe the applicant ""will not be likely to act in a manner dangerous to public safety and that the granting of the relief would not be contrary to the public interest."" But Congress has denied the bureau the funding for such a program. Congress since 1993 has said no funds given to the agency ""shall be available to investigate or act upon applications for relief from Federal firearms disabilities."" That’s the legal term for someone who is not allowed to own a gun. The amendment would allow the agency to dip into federal funds to consider those applications. What it means The amendment does not give people with criminal convictions free access to firearms. Each person would be evaluated individually by the ATF. There’s no guarantee that an applicant would be granted gun rights. If someone was convicted of a violent crime, for example, the agency may consider the person to be dangerous to public safety and deny the request. Other criminal convictions may be seen as a lesser threat to public safety. Someone convicted of embezzlement in the past may be judged differently than someone with a violent felony conviction. ""Congressman Buck’s amendment allows the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives to once again process petitions from citizens for the restoration of their Second Amendment rights,"" said Kyle Huwa, Buck’s spokesperson. ""This petition process is already established under federal statute. The amendment makes no determination on the substance of the petitions."" Our ruling Serrano said Republicans want to restore gun rights to felons. An amendment proposed by a Republican congressman would allow people who have been stripped of their gun rights by the government to ask for them back. That’s not limited to people with a felony and it’s not guaranteed they will be approved. Serrano’s statement is accurate but needs clarification",Mostly True,"September 22, 2017"
"Says Sen. Jon Tester ""believes that we should have a national registration so that the people of Montana should have to ask permission before they purchase a gun, ask permission from the federal government.""","While declaring his U.S. Senate bid, Republican hopeful Matt Rosendale zeroed in on the Second Amendment record of his opponent Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont. ""Tester believes that we should have a national registration so that the people of Montana should have to ask permission before they purchase a gun, ask permission from the federal government,"" Rosendale, Montana's state auditor, said in a July 31 interview on Voices of Montana. We decided to investigate whether Tester supports a national gun registry. It turns out the opposite is true. This point may seem obvious but it bears highlighting: the government does not have a single, consolidated list of all guns and all gun owners across the country, or, what a layperson would call a national gun registry. ""When people talk about national gun registration, they most commonly are talking about a list of people who own guns lawfully, or a list of the guns that are lawfully owned,"" said David Kopel, a policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute who has authored several books on gun control. An important caveat, however, is that the National Firearms Act of 1934, which Congress passed in response to that era’s rash of organized crime, did set up a registry for limited types of guns and other weapons. Those included machine guns, which fire multiple rounds with a single pull of the trigger; short-barreled rifles or shotguns; disguised guns, like those made to look like a belt buckle; hand grenades; and silencers. While some might consider the registration of machine guns and silencers to be a national gun registry, that’s inconsistent with common parlance. Further, Rosendale’s statement alleges Tester supports a registry to apply broadly to ""the people of Montana,"" and Rosendale’s campaign gave no indication he was referring to the narrower National Firearms Act registry. We asked Rosendale’s campaign for evidence that Tester supports a national gun registry. They pointed us to a vote Tester cast in favor of a 2015 amendment sponsored by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., that failed in the Senate. Did that measure seek to establish a federal list of guns and their owners? Not even close. For the past nearly 20 years, federally licensed gun dealers have been required to run an FBI background check on customers. Would-be purchasers are checked against an FBI list of people prohibited by law from owning guns: those with felony convictions, known illegal aliens and domestic abusers, to name a few categories. The Feinstein amendment sought to extend the FBI’s list to those on the U.S. government’s consolidated terror watchlist of known or suspected terrorists, and grant the attorney general discretion to deny them from buying a gun. The Rosendale campaign’s argument appears to be as follows: Because the terror watchlist has mistakenly listed innocent people, the watchlist could be used as a national gun registry. Experts dismissed the notion that to deny gun sales to the government’s list of known and suspected terrorists, flawed as it may be, is the same thing as making a federal list of lawfully-owned guns and its owners. ""The terror watch list is not a gun registry,"" said Philip J. Cook, a professor of public policy studies at Duke University and an expert on gun control. ""In fact, if the Feinstein amendment were passed and enforced, then the terror watch list would be a registry of people who did not have guns!"" David Hemenway, a professor of health policy at Harvard University who has written extensively about firearms policy, said the Rosendale campaign’s explanation of the Feinstein amendment doesn’t add up. ""This simply has involved changing the criteria for passing a background check. It is nothing like a registry,"" Hemenway said. ""He doesn't seem to understand what a registry is."" So Rosendale’s central claim is flat wrong — but he didn’t stop there. Rosendale said the registry Tester allegedly supports would require Montanans to ""ask permission from the federal government"" before they purchase a gun. Because the alleged gun registry proposal is a fiction, it can have no policy implications. So this extra bit only serves to enhance the claim’s absurdity. The Rosendale campaign said further that Tester’s votes against several measures means he is tolerant of a national gun registry because these measures would have made it harder to enact one. However — leaving aside whether these bills would have done that — the reality is that Tester’s record shows clear instances where he opposed gun registries. Tester voted for the 2013 Manchin-Toomey Amendment, a bipartisan background check plan, which we previously found would have strengthened federal law prohibiting the creation of a national gun registry. In 2011, he was among a group of lawmakers who pushed for a provision to block federal funding from being used to retain gun background check records for more than 24 hours, and voted in favor of the bill that contained this provision. (Tester expressed concern as early as 2006 that maintaining such records could be the first step toward a national gun registry). He also co-signed a 2011 letter to President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton raising Second Amendment concerns that a proposed U.N. arms trade deal could lead to an ""international gun registry."" For this, Tester earned praise from the National Rifle Association for ""stand(ing) on the side of America's 80 million gun owners in opposition to those who want to eliminate our freedoms."" Rosendale said Tester ""believes that we should have a national registration so that the people of Montana should have to ask permission before they purchase a gun, ask permission from the federal government."" Tester’s record shows opposition to a federal list of lawfully-owned guns and gun owners. To claim he supports this is absurd",False Pants on Fire,"August 21, 2017"
"Chicago city officials ""have adopted an official policy of protecting criminal aliens who prey on their own residents.""","When Chicago filed a lawsuit Aug. 7 to block the U.S. Justice Department from withholding federal police grant money from so-called sanctuary cities, U.S. Attorney Jeff Sessions reacted swiftly and fiercely. ""To a degree perhaps unsurpassed by any other jurisdiction, the political leadership of Chicago has chosen deliberately and intentionally to adopt a policy that obstructs this country’s lawful immigration system,"" Sessions said in a press release. ""They have demonstrated an open hostility to enforcing laws designed to protect law enforcement — Federal, state, and local — and reduce crime, and instead have adopted an official policy of protecting criminal aliens who prey on their own residents."" Under its Welcoming City Ordinance, which defines Chicago’s ""sanctuary city"" status, the Chicago Police Department ""will not question crime victims, witnesses and other law-abiding residents about their legal status."" It also will not use immigration status alone as grounds for detention, and it imposes strict limits on interaction between police officers and federal immigration agents. Like other cities with similar policies, Chicago says doing so fosters trust between immigrant communities and the police department, so immigrants won’t fear coming to police to report crime or assist police investigations. Accusing the Chicago Police Department of maintaining ""an official policy of protecting criminal aliens who prey on their own residents"" is a pretty serious charge from the nation’s top law enforcement officer. We thought this deserved a closer look. Chicago was one of Donald Trump’s favorite punching bags during the 2016 presidential campaign, when he repeatedly invoked the city’s murder and gun-crime rate as a byproduct of everything from its gun laws to its leadership. After he was elected, he threatened to ""send in the feds"" to tamp down the city’s crime. If Chicago doesn't fix the horrible ""carnage"" going on, 228 shootings in 2017 with 42 killings (up 24% from 2016), I will send in the Feds!   Sessions’ invocation of ""criminal aliens who prey on their own residents"" refers to a theme that has been prevalent in Trump’s platform ever since the day he announced his candidacy with a speech highly disparaging of Mexican immigrants who enter the U.S. illegally. The central premise is that undocumented immigrants present an unusually high propensity for crime. On Aug. 16, Sessions doubled down on the alleged link between Chicago’s violent crime and its sanctuary city status in a speech in Miami, which dropped its sanctuary status to comply with the Trump administration’s crackdown on immigration. ""Respect for the rule of law has broken down. In Chicago, their so-called ‘sanctuary’ policies are just one sad example,"" Sessions said. ""...We have already seen that: the same Independence Day weekend when Chicago suffered more than 100 shootings and 15 homicides, Miami-Dade also had an historic number of shooting deaths – zero."" The alleged link between illegal immigrants and surges in crime is an idea that has been debunked repeatedly for decades in numerous academic, government and advocacy-group studies. So we started our look at Sessions’ statement by contacting the Department of Justice with a request for data to back up his claim. The response we got back was obtuse and weird. It came from a justice department press aide and was so loaded with swampy beltway caveats--""deep background,"" ""background,"" ""not for attribution,"" and ""off the record"" -- that we consulted our dog-eared copy of ""All The President’s Men"" for guidance. But to no avail. To be clear, we never agreed to any preconditions in seeking official comment and feel under no obligation to abide by them. And we won’t. So what follows, in full, is the official DOJ response to our question. (Click here to view in pdf format.)   Where to start? Perhaps with the link to the Washington Post story, which argues vigorously against the position taken by Sessions even while acknowledging that there’s no way to be 100 percent sure there’s no link between illegal immigration and Chicago’s homicide rate. At the same time, the article does state flatly, ""There’s no link between a jurisdiction being a sanctuary city and higher crime rates."" It also cites a pair of statistics that would argue strongly against the DOJ’s position. While 84 percent of Chicago’s undocumented immigrants come from Latin America, 82 percent of its murder victims at the time of the article were black vs. only 4 percent Hispanic, the Post reports. ""FBI data show that most killings in the United States are carried out by people in the same racial group as the victim. The reason for this is obvious: Homicides are usually a function of personal relationships, and people generally associate with family members and friends who share their racial identity,"" the article states. It’s not conclusive evidence that immigrants aren’t driving up Chicago’s homicide rate, it continues, but ""this isn’t what we’d expect the demographics to look like if Chicago’s homicides were tightly intertwined with a population of immigrants who are in the country illegally from Latin America."" DOJ also referred us to a 2016 study by the Murder Accountability Project, a non-profit group that tracks unsolved homicides and advocates for better crime reporting, that showed Illinois had the lowest homicide clearance rate in the nation. But the report attributes the state’s poor showing to record-keeping methods used by the Illinois State Police in gathering crime data statewide. Still, the DOJ spokesman argues that combining those articles with Chicago’s status as a sanctuary city -- in which police do not collect immigration information -- validates Sessions. Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson, however, has a simpler explanation. ""The vast majority of our issues in Chicago and our violent crime is committed by homegrown people - either individuals that were born and raised in Chicago or most certainly in this country,"" Johnson said in an NPR interview Aug. 7. ""So our instances of undocumented people committing horrific crimes and murder in particular in Chicago is just - it's nominal."" Against those two articles stands a mountain of research that casts doubt on Sessions’ assertion that illegal immigrants cause crime to rise and that Chicago’s official police policy on immigrants endangers residents. ""Immigrants are in fact much less likely to commit crime than natives, and the presence of large numbers of immigrants seems to lower crime rates,"" said a 2015 report by the National Academy of Sciences. One of the authors of that report explained why to PolitiFact in 2016: Immigrants come to the United States to build better lives for themselves and their children, said Walter A. Ewing, a senior researcher at the American Immigration Council and one of the report’s authors. ""They are very motivated to not blow that opportunity by getting in trouble with the police,"" he said in an email interview. ""This is especially so for unauthorized immigrants, who can be deported at any time for unlawful presence."" Crime went down even as the immigrant population increased, the report said. The NAS study reinforced the findings of a 2005 paper by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. ""Despite the widespread perception of a link between immigration and crime, immigrants have much lower institutionalization (incarceration) rates than the native born. More recently arrived immigrants have the lowest comparative incarceration rates, and this difference increased from 1980 to 2000,"" that report said. These studies blow a big hole in Sessions’ underlying assertion of ""criminal aliens"" being significantly responsible for the increase in gun violence in Chicago. But what about Sessions’ allegation that Chicago’s ""official policy"" protects ""criminal aliens?"" CPD’s directive ""Responding to Incidents Involving Citizenship Status"" lays out the do’s and don’ts for officers dealing with undocumented immigrants. Essentially, it prohibits officers from detaining anyone based on questions about citizenship status and sharply limits interaction with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency. However, it also establishes exceptions for suspects with outstanding criminal warrants, who are known gang members or convicted felons or are on trial for a felony. The city defended its policy in its lawsuit against the federal government: ""(T)his policy promotes public safety by ensuring that no city resident or visitor, regardless of immigration status, is afraid to cooperate with law enforcement, report criminal activity to the police, testify as a witness in court, or seek help as a victim of crime; and by ensuring that police officers focus on criminal activity occurring in Chicago instead of federal civil immigration infractions."" A 2017 report by the National Immigration Law Center that focused specifically on counties that employed ""sanctuary city"" policies bolsters Chicago’s case. ""Crime is statistically significantly lower in sanctuary counties compared to nonsanctuary (sic) counties,"" the report said. ""The data support arguments made by law enforcement executives that communities are safer when law enforcement agencies do not become entangled in federal immigration enforcement efforts."" The problem for Chicago here is that, because its police department does not collect immigration data, the city can’t unequivocally state that its murder or gun violence rates are not attributable to immigrants. The anecdotal evidence in Chicago’s favor appears strong, but it’s still anecdotal. U.S. Attorney Jeff Sessions said Chicago’s leaders ""have adopted an official policy of protecting criminal aliens who prey on their own residents."" Chicago’s Welcoming City Ordinance does prohibit Chicago police officers from using citizenship information as the sole grounds for detaining people and sharply limits the interaction between city police and federal immigration agents. But evidence overwhelmingly suggests this is much less a matter of ""protecting criminal aliens"" than of fostering trust between local law enforcement and immigrant communities. Yet because Chicago does not collect immigration data in police interactions, it can’t be known conclusively how many of its murders and gun crimes are committed by illegal immigrants ""who prey on their own residents."" That absence of conclusive data to disprove Sessions doesn’t give him license to make claims that are groundless. Chicago’s sanctuary city policy does not protect undocumented people who commit crimes, despite what Sessions claims",False Pants on Fire,"August 16, 2017"
"""Violent crimes where a firearm is used have remained static since 2013 in both New York State and Erie County""","Rep. Chris Collins, R-Clarence, says some of New York state’s gun control laws should be scrapped. The 2013 Secure Ammunition and Firearm Enforcement Act was supposed to reduce gun violence in New York. Collins says there’s no evidence that’s happened. ""Statistics show that violent crimes where a firearm is used have remained static since 2013 in both New York State and Erie County,"" Collins said in an op-ed in The Buffalo News. Collins is sponsoring federal legislation to reverse parts of the SAFE Act that regulate rifles and shotguns. He says the law has been an unnecessary burden for gun owners across upstate New York. But is he right that the number of violent crimes with a firearm has been unchanged since 2013? Statewide data For the state as a whole, the numbers don't back up Collins' claim. In 2016, there were 10,007 violent crimes with a firearm reported to police,  according to data from the New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services. In 2013, there were 12,235. The percentage of violent crimes with a firearm also fell from 16 percent in 2013 to 13.5 percent in 2016. Looked at another way, the number of firearm-related violent crimes per New York state resident also has declined. There were 62 firearm-related violent crimes reported for every 100,000 residents in 2013, compared with 50 for every 100,000 residents by 2016. The number of firearm-related violent crimes has decreased statewide each year since 2012, the first year New York City was included in the data. The number was already going down outside New York City before the SAFE Act in 2013. There were 5,340 violent firearm crimes reported to police outside New York City in 2008 — the most in the last decade. The count has only increased twice since, in 2012 and 2016. Erie County data In Erie County, the trend is different. Violent crimes with a firearm have been on the rise. Police in Erie County reported 1,154 violent crimes with a firearm in 2016 — more than any other county upstate. That’s up from 1,092 in 2013. The rate of firearm-related violent crimes has also increased, from 118 of those crimes for every 100,000 Erie County residents in 2013 to 125 in 2016. Collins’s view A spokesperson for Collins said he based his claim on an article from WKBW, a Buffalo news station. ""The SAFE Act has done little to keep Western New Yorkers safe and has taken away the Second Amendment rights of law abiding citizens,"" Collins spokesperson Sarah Minkel said in a statement responding to our findings. WKBW used the same data we did and presented the same results, though the article notes there have been ""no major changes in crime rate"" since 2013. Our ruling Collins said ""statistics show that violent crimes where a firearm is used have remained static since 2013 in both New York State and Erie County."" Statistics tell a different story. Violent crimes with a firearm have decreased statewide since 2013 and increased in Erie County. But correlation does not equal causation.

"Says Dontre Hamilton ""was shot 14 times by police for resting on a park bench in Milwaukee.""","On the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives on June 29, 2017, U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore, D-Milwaukee, declared: Dontre Hamilton ""was shot 14 times by police for resting on a park bench in Milwaukee."" Is that what happened? The incident can be viewed in at least two different ways. Literally speaking, Hamilton was not killed simply for resting on a bench. He was shot after striking an officer with the officer’s baton. But in making a rhetorical point, Moore is correct that Hamilton had done nothing to attract the attention of police but fall asleep in a park. And the fatal shooting occurred after two other officers had twice observed Hamilton and determined he was doing nothing wrong.   Moore’s comments Moore took to the House floor to promote a bill she introduced three days earlier. Under the measure, states and localities receiving certain federal grants would have to require their law enforcement officers to undergo training on ""de-escalation techniques to assist in reducing the need for the use of force"" by officers. She made her claim about Hamilton after arguing that her bill should be made law before summer ends, saying: We know that kids are out of school and that the tensions in our streets are high. Police on alert, and far too many of us are distrustful of the police due to the painful and frightful memories of how many deadly encounters have dominated headlines -- close to a thousand in one year.  How can this Congress recess for the summer and not take up this bill? Yes, the Affordable Care Act is a big issue here before us in Congress. But if you live in communities of color around the country, the immediate health care issue for you is being shot by a police officer who has been sworn to protect you.  If you die at age 12, like Tamir Rice, who was shot by police for playing with his sister on a playground in Cleveland, how can you be concerned with the Medicaid? If you’re killed at 31 years old like Dontre Hamilton, who was shot 14 times by police for resting on a park bench in Milwaukee, nursing home care is not your priority. You won’t have the fortune of living that long.   Her office did not respond to our requests for information for this fact check. The Hamilton incident Hillary Clinton injected the Hamilton incident into the 2016 presidential campaign. At a Democratic debate with Bernie Sanders in Milwaukee, she said Hamilton was ""unarmed"" when he was killed. Our rating was Mostly True. Hamilton, a 31-year-old diagnosed with schizophrenia, had a history of contacts with Milwaukee police, but no convictions for any violent crimes. He was shot to death by Christopher Manney, a Milwaukee officer who worked in the downtown area, on April 30, 2014. Manney was fired -- not for the fatal shooting itself, but for the way he approached Hamilton, which led to a scuffle. Here’s a summary of the incident from our Clinton fact check, based on a report by the Milwaukee County district attorney: First call: Shortly before 2 p.m., an employee at the Starbucks located in Red Arrow Park downtown called police about Hamilton, who was sleeping in the park. The call was classified as a ""welfare check"" -- in other words, to check if Hamilton was OK. A desk sergeant called Manney’s cell phone and left a voicemail message, saying he wanted Manney to go to the park about ""a homeless guy sleeping"" there. Two officers respond: Because Manney didn’t immediately respond to the voicemail, the Starbucks call was referred to a dispatcher, who then dispatched two other officers to the park. They found Hamilton lying on his back with his eyes closed. They nudged Hamilton, he got up and provided identification and said he was taking a nap and was all right. The officers left. Second call: About 2:10 p.m., another call to police about Hamilton came from Starbucks. The two officers returned and told the employees that Hamilton was not doing anything wrong. The officers left shortly before 3 p.m. Manney responds: Just before 3:30 p.m., about 90 minutes after the first call, Manney listened to the voicemail. He called dispatch and asked if there was an assignment for Red Arrow Park. Told there was not, Manney asked ""that he be recorded as responding to a trouble with subject"" call, and he went to the park. He apparently was not aware the other officers had preceded him.

Fight occurs: Manney approached Hamilton, who was lying down, helped him up and then began to pat him down. Hamilton resisted. Witnesses told police that Manney, who was yelling commands at Hamilton, struck Hamilton one or more times with his baton before Hamilton took the baton and struck Manney with it one or more times.

Manney shoots Hamilton: The witnesses said Hamilton was holding the baton -- one said menacingly -- when Manney fired his service weapon. He fired 14 times, resulting in 15 gunshot wounds to Hamilton. In announcing Manney’s firing, Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn said Manney decided Hamilton was dangerous ""based solely on observations of apparent mental illness, absent any overt actions on the part of Mr. Hamilton."" Our rating Moore says Hamilton ""was shot 14 times by police for resting on a park bench in Milwaukee."" Two officers twice responded to calls about Hamilton sleeping in the park and allowed him to continue sleeping there and left. He was still resting there when a different officer later and arrived and began patting him down. That triggered a physical altercation, with the officer hitting Hamilton with his baton and then Hamilton taking the baton and striking the officer. The officer then fatally shot Hamilton 14 times. In short, Hamilton was not shot simply for resting on a park bench. But the shooting occurred only because of a physical altercation that was sparked by the way the third officer began patting Hamilton down -- after two officers who came to the park twice decided Hamilton wasn’t doing anything wrong. In fact, the officer was fired for the way he approached Hamilton",Mostly True,"August 1, 2017"
"Say Gretchen Carlson said, ""The 2nd Amendment Was Written Before Guns Were Invented.""","Clickbait websites love to make up fake quotes for celebrities and controversial politicians, hoping to mislead readers into clicking into their content and seeing their ads. For instance, we recently fact-checked a post accusing former Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., of saying something she didn’t say; we rated it Pants on Fire. Now, as part of Facebook’s efforts to fight fake news, we learned that users had flagged as questionable a post from someone Bachmann used to babysit for -- former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson. (Yes, the babysitting part is actually true.) The claim about Carlson appeared first on a site called therightists.com. It was headlined, ""Gretchen Carlson: ‘The 2nd Amendment Was Written Before Guns Were Invented.’ "" Within days, the item was picked up and reprinted essentially verbatim on other websites. One version got 31,400 shares through July 24. The accompanying article uses as its launching-off point something that Carlson did actually do -- making an on-air break with conservative orthodoxy by saying, in the wake of the Orlando nightclub mass shooting in 2016, that the assault-weapons ban should be reinstated. ""Do we need AR-15s to hunt and kill deer? Do we need them to protect our families?"" she asked on air. ""Can’t we hold true the sanctity of the Second Amendment while still having common sense?"" These comments drew opposition from gun-rights supporters. It’s at this point that the article veers off into fabrication. The article reads, ""Interestingly, when confronted by Second Amendment supporters on Twitter, Carlson doubled down on her pro-ban stance, claiming that ‘the fact that you’re even using the Second Amendment as an argument against banning assault weapons shows me you’re ignorant. Don’t you know the 2nd Amendment was written before guns were even invented?’ "" This would be a ridiculous claim if she’d actually said it. As schoolchildren are taught, muskets were used in the American Revolution. (Here’s an example from the collection of the Museum of the American Revolution.) And the revolution occurred more than a decade before the 1789 drafting and ratification of the Bill of Rights, which includes the Second Amendment. (""A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed."") Indeed, the history of firearms goes back even further than that -- to the 1300s, more than four centuries before the Second Amendment was written.

"Says Miami-Dade Circuit Court Judge Milton Hirsch ""is constantly overturned.""","Florida House Speaker Richard Corcoran disagreed with a ruling by a Miami judge that Florida’s updated ""stand your ground"" self-defense law is unconstitutional. Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Milton Hirsch ruled that state legislators overstepped their authority in modifying the law earlier this year to force prosecutors to disprove a defendant’s self-defense claim at a pre-trial hearing. Any such change should have been crafted by the Florida Supreme Court rather than the state Legislature, he ruled. Hirsch’s July 3 ruling doesn’t apply statewide, but it does start the process that could ultimately lead to Florida Supreme Court review.   Corcoran, a Land O’Lakes Republican and lawyer, laid out his opposition to Hirsch’s ruling in three tweets: ""It is the role of the Legislature to write the laws that govern how Floridians may exercise their statutory and constitutional rights. The Florida House will continue to stand with ordinary citizens who exercise their right to self-defense. There's a reason this judge is constantly overturned. We look forward to this decision being reversed on appeal."" There's a reason this judge is constantly overturned. We look forward to this decision being reversed on appeal 3 https://t.co/emJlUmSt1l Corcoran’s spokesman provided no data about how often Hirsch is overturned. Instead, Fred Piccolo pointed to a handful of cases in which Hirsch had been overturned and one case that remains pending in appeals. ""The speaker used the term ‘constantly overturned’ -- which is not quantifiable,"" Piccolo said. ""But the insinuation is that the judge has been overturned on substantive/controversial issues often."" Hirsch has handled thousands of cases since he was elected in 2010. PolitiFact searched for Hirsch’s individual rulings in the Third District Court of Appeal and found that he was upheld about 160 times. We found that the appeals court overturned Hirsch six times. In six other cases he was upheld in part and reversed in part. (In a couple of other cases, the appeals court was critical of actions by Hirsch. The court disagreed with his ruling as a substitute judge in one case, and in another case the court said he should have granted a prosecutor’s motion to recuse himself.) (Hat tip to Carolina Bolado, a writer for Law 360, who looked at Hirsch’s appeals record first.) We sent a summary of our findings to a spokeswoman for the Miami-Dade courts, Eunice Sigler. She didn’t dispute our overall findings but offered caveats related to a couple of cases, including that in one case the appeals court reversed based upon a Florida Supreme Court decision that occurred after the judge ruled. We interviewed five law professors and all of them rejected the idea that Hirsch is ""constantly overturned."" Stetson law professor Charles Rose described Corcoran’s statement as ""scurrilous."" ""I don’t think there is any credible evidence that the judge is prone to being overturned,"" he said. ""A comment on how often a judge is overturned is an example of what we teach as ‘pivoting.’ When you are losing an argument you are making, you want to pivot and change the conversation."" The fact that a judge has been appealed doesn’t mean the judge is right or wrong, Rose said. There is a valuable purpose in the appeals process. ""If judges weren’t willing to be overturned, the law couldn’t grow and change to reflect society,"" he said. University of Florida professor Darren Lenard Hutchinson said it would be extremely rare for a trial judge's rulings to be ""constantly overturned."" ""Doctrines in federal and state courts often require appeals courts to extend deference to lower courts, particularly regarding findings of fact,"" he said. While judges and lawyers keep an eye on overturned cases, a more interesting question is whether a judge takes a stand on high-profile controversial legal issues, said Nova professor Megan Chaney. ""This just means he has the courage to do his job and force the appellate courts to clarify the law where it is unclear or potentially unconstitutional,"" she said. Piccolo pointed to an article in the Miami Herald that summarized some of Hirsch’s other high-profile rulings including some that had been overturned. Here is a summary: State vs. James Lacroix: In March, Hirsch ruled that Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez’s decision to allow county jails to hold undocumented immigrants awaiting deportation by federal agents was unconstitutional. The county is appealing. State vs. Gaiter: In 2016, Hirsch ruled that a new death-penalty sentencing structure was unconstitutional because it didn’t require a unanimous jury verdict. The Florida Supreme Court ruled the same months later in a separate case. State vs. Bailey: An attorney stole $700,000 from a trust account. Hirsch sentenced him to probation only. The court reversed Hirsch and called for the imposition of a prison term. State vs. Borrego: A prosecutor made a motion for Hirsch to recuse himself based on his comments about fingerprints in another case, but Hirsch suggested that the prosecutor file a motion to disqualify him. The appeals court ruled that Hirsch should have granted the prosecutor’s motion. Hall vs. Ryan: Hirsch, acting as a substitute judge, released a man convicted of child abuse accused of violating probation on his own recognizance on the condition that he stay away from a minor. The appeals court ruled that Hirsch didn’t have jurisdiction to revisit the presiding judge’s decision to hold the defendant in custody without bond. State vs. Washington: When a Tampa federal judge ruled in 2011 that Florida's drug law was unconstitutional, Hirsch was the only local state judge to follow suit, the Herald wrote. He tossed out more than two dozen cases, but Miami's appeals court later reversed Hirsch. Following Hirsch’s ruling in a ""stand your ground"" case, Corcoran tweeted ""There's a reason this judge is constantly overturned."" But Corcoran didn’t point to any data about how often Hirsch has been overturned after ruling in thousands of cases since 2010. Instead, Corcoran pointed to Hirsch’s rulings in six other cases. Corcoran is exaggerating when he suggests this handful of cases constitutes being ""constantly overturned."" We found Hirsch had been upheld about 160 times and overturned six times and then affirmed in part in another six cases",False,"July 11, 2017"
"""Americans are 25x more likely to be shot & killed than others in developed countries."""," Gun control is a top priority for California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom. So, it’s no surprise Newsom, a Democrat and 2018 candidate for governor, promoted the cause on National Gun Violence Awareness Day. He claimed in a statement on Twitter on June 2, 2017: ""Americans are 25x more likely to be shot & killed than others in developed countries. We've had enough. #NationalGunViolenceAwarenessDay.""  This is not the first time we’ve fact-checked a gun claim by Newsom. In November 2016, we rated Mostly True his assertion that California has seen a ""56 percent decline in the gun murder rate"" since the 1990s. Earlier that year, we rated Mostly False his statement that ""So far in 2015, there have been more mass shootings than days."" In this case, we wondered whether the facts support his claim about the seemingly huge disparity in gun homicide rates between the United States and other developed countries. We’ll fact-check this claim below. First, here’s some background on Newsom and the 2018 California governor’s race. Governor’s race Newsom is among several prominent Democrats as of now competing in 2018 to succeed Jerry Brown as governor. Others include former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa; California Treasurer John Chiang and Delaine Eastin, the state’s former superintendent for public instruction. Announced Republican candidates include John Cox, a venture capitalist from San Diego County and Rosie Grier, a Hall of Fame professional football player. As part of our Tracking The Truth series, PolitiFact California is fact-checking claims in the 2018 governor’s race.  Tracking the Truth: Hear a claim you want fact-checked? Email us at [email protected], tweet us @CAPolitiFact or contact us on Facebook. Newsom has supported California’s stringent gun and ammunition laws. In 2016, he proposed and helped pass Proposition 63, a voter initiative that requires instant background checks for the sale of ammunition statewide. Our research We interpreted Newsom’s claim of ""shot and killed"" to mean gun homicides. These are intentional killings using a firearm, not including suicides. To back up the statement, Newsom’s campaign spokesman pointed to a study published in the American Journal of Medicine in March 2016 called ""Violent Death Rates: The US Compared with Other High-income OECD Countries, 2010."" The study relied on mortality data from 2010 collected by the World Health Organization. It found the rate of gun homicides was 25.2 times higher in the United States than in 22 other populous and high-income countries for which data was also gathered. A sample of those included South Korea, Australia, Canada, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom and Italy. When considering all types of gun deaths, such as homicides, accidental shootings and suicides, people in the United States were 10 times more likely to die from a gun-related death than those in the other countries, the report said. Authors of study weigh in We contacted the co-authors of this study. Both described Newsom’s claim as ""accurate."" ""Yes, what he said seems accurate,"" David Hemenway, professor of health policy at the Harvard School of Public Health and co-author, said by email. ""I think anyone who looks at the data would agree."" Erin Grinshteyn, an assistant professor of health policy at the University of San Francisco and the other co-author, also said the claim was correct. Grinshteyn described the report as ""purely an academic study."" She said her portion of the work was not funded while Hemenway’s participation was funded, in part, by the Joyce Foundation. On its website, the foundation says it supports ""research-based strategies that can prevent gun violence by reducing the easy accessibility of firearms."" Related study In 2014, PolitiFact examined a related claim by lawyer and author Lisa Bloom that said ""Americans are 20 times as likely to die from gun violence as citizens of other civilized countries."" PolitiFact took this to mean gun homicides. It rated her claim Mostly True, citing figures collected by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. That data showed the United States had a slightly lower gun homicide rate in 2010 than reported in the American Journal of Medicine Study. That, in turn, meant Americans would be closer to 20 times as likely to die in gun homicides compared with several other ""civilized countries."" But as PolitiFact noted, much depends on which countries are included in this comparison and the years for which that data was available. Chile and Turkey, both with relatively high gun homicide rates, were included in the United Nations study but not in the report in the American Journal of Medicine. Grinshteyn told us her study only included high-income, populous countries  as defined by the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development. ""If they included Chile and Turkey, which were not included in our comparison group, those will cause the comparison to be skewed,"" she added. We reached out to the Sacramento-based Firearms Policy Coalition, a gun rights advocacy group, to ask whether its members knew of any additional and independent reports on this topic. We did not immediately hear back. Our rating Candidate for California governor Gavin Newsom recently said ""Americans are 25x more likely to be shot and killed than others in developed countries."" Newsom’s spokesman pointed to a study in the American Journal of Medicine that backs up this very sad statistic. It found the gun homicide rate in the United States is about 25 times greater than in other high-income, industrialized countries such as Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom and Canada. A similar study by the United Nations found America had a slightly lower gun homicide rate but included countries such as Turkey and Chile with relatively high gun homicide rates not included in the American Journal of Medicine report. Their inclusion explains the slightly lower rate. Newsom’s claim is backed by what appears to be a valid study. But another report with credible findings shows the gun homicide rate is not quite as high compared to other nations as Newsom asserts. His statement could have used this additional information",Mostly True,"June 14, 2017"
"""The first Congress passed a law mandating that every able-bodied man must own a musket.""","To whoops and applause, Ted Cruz told National Rifle Association members there was a time that Congress required men to own guns. In his April 28, 2017, speech, which the association live-streamed on Facebook, the Texas Republican pointed out that muskets were vital in American revolutionary times and ""what everybody carried into combat."" ""Anyone know the first gun control laws in the United States?"" Cruz went on. ""The first Congress passed a law mandating that every able-bodied man must own a musket. That’s gun control Founding Fathers’ style."" Congressional historian, records After unsuccessfully seeking Cruz’s historical backup, we turned to a George Washington University historian, Kenneth Russell Bowling, who told us by phone he was fresh off contributing to the publication of 22 volumes of papers related to the earliest years of Congress. Bowling said Cruz was likely reflecting on a measure passed into law by the nation’s second Congress in 1792. To get a fix on that, Bowling suggested that we consult record-keepers at the Library of Congress where, by email, a librarian who went unidentified pointed us to documentation of the Second Militia Act of 1792, approved by Congress on May 8, 1792 — six days after passage of the Militia Act of 1792 (which was repealed in 1795) giving the president authority to call out state militias to repel U.S. invasions and to do so in the case of state insurrections at the request of state officials or on approval of a federal district judge or an associate justice of the Supreme Court. The second act required ""each and every free able-bodied white male citizen"" aged 18 through 44 to enroll in his state militia within the next year with the exception of the vice president, other federally elected officials and specified workers such as  ""all ferrymen employed at any ferry on the post road"" as well as individuals exempted by state laws. Commanders were to continue enrolling eligible men in coming years, the law said. Per Cruz’s claim, the law said every enrolled man ""shall within six months thereafter, provide himself with a good musket or firelock, a sufficient bayonet and belt, two spare flints and a knapsack, a pouch with a box therein to contain not less than twenty-four cartridges, suited to the bore of his musket or firelock, each cartridge to contain a proper quantity of powder and ball...""          SOURCE: Website, ""A Century of Lawmaking: for a New Nation: U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774 - 1875,"" Statutes at Large, 2nd Congress, 1st Session, Library of Congress (accessed May 16, 2017) Our ruling Cruz said: ""The first Congress passed a law mandating that every able-bodied man must own a musket."" Action by the nation’s second Congress wasn’t that far-reaching. The law required states to create militias to be staffed by some able-bodied white men aged 18 through 44 who were to provide their own muskets and other supplies.

"A University of Texas ""student pulled out a concealed handgun"" on a knife-wielding suspect ""and made him back down.""","Web posts assert that the May 1, 2017, stabbing attacks at the University of Texas ended after a heroic student pulled out a handgun. A reader inquiry after the incident that left one student dead and three wounded led us to fact-check a May 2, 2017, web post on ihavethetruth.com headlined ""Texas Campus Concealed Carry Student Stops Slaughter at UT Austin."" That post says: ""Eyewitnesses reported that a student pulled out a concealed handgun on the suspect and made him back down, stopping what was heading towards a slaughter! Although Fox has reported the incident, the local media is working real hard on not covering that little fact. Imagine that!"" Ihavethetruth.com doesn’t describe itself as a news source--or much otherwise. Its ""About"" web page says only: ""I Have The Truth is where you show up every day for your marching orders."" No evidence, newspaper says A day after the site said a student intervened with a gun, the Austin American-Statesman published a news story finding no confirmation that a gun-toting student got involved. The prospect of someone pulling a gun had seemed especially possible because the Texas law allowing individuals with state-issued permits to carry a handgun on public college campuses took effect in August 2016. The American-Statesman story, partly headlined ""VIRAL ITEM DEBUNKED,"" said chatter about a student possibly brandishing a gun to help police end the incident appeared to have originated in an anonymous Twitter feed, whose user posted a screenshot of a conversation thread in which someone – whose name was blurred out – claims to have ""grabbed my gun and ... chased the kid briefly."" According to the story by reporter Marty Toohey, UT police termed the rumor of help from an armed student false and said they’d found no corroborating evidence, be it video or first-hand accounts. ""It’s a rumor and there’s nothing to verify it,"" campus spokeswoman Cindy Posey said. Meanwhile, the student-with-a-gun account also was trumpeted on the InfoWars web site under the headline ""Report: Student with gun stops mass stabbing at University of Texas."" Its post pointed to a May 1, 2017, tweet by @TexasRebel56, who appears to have shared a screenshot of a private message of someone – the names of the people on thread are obscured – claiming: ""I ran inside and grabbed my gun out (sic) and came back and chased the kid briefly but I wasn’t comfortable shooting because people were around."" Also on May 1, a UT student who arrived at the scene after the attack told the American-Statesman that another student told him he had ""flashed"" a gun at the suspect. But police said they couldn’t confirm that story, adding that it was unlikely based upon the incident's brief timeframe. The same day, UT Student Government Vice President Binna Kim was among those who repeated the rumor, though after sending it via GroupMe she promptly tweeted an apology that stated the rumor had not been confirmed. Police chief a day later At a May 2, 2017, press conference, a reporter asked UT Police Chief David Carter: ""There was a rumor on social media that someone with a concealed handgun prevented further attacks. Is there any validity to that?"" Carter replied: ""So one of the things that bedevils police departments on occasion is the information that comes across social media. ""Yes, we’ve heard that,"" the chief said. ""We have no verification of that. I will tell you, if you look at the sequence of events and the timeline, it doesn’t appear likely."" Carter said that a minute and a half elapsed between the stabbings and before the student accused of the knife attacks, Kendrex White, was apprehended as he moved toward a campus dormitory knife-in-hand. A day earlier, Carter specified that that about 1:49 p.m. May 1, his department got a call about an individual who ""actually attacked or assaulted somebody"" near a gym. In less than two minutes, an officer was on the scene. The officer observed the individual walking away from an individual who was down on the ground,"" Carter said. ""He was armed with a large, Bowie-style hunting knife."" The officer confronted the man, Carter said, drawing his weapon and ordering the man to the ground. Then the suspect was taken into custody. On May 4, 2017, the debunkists at Snopes.com found ""unproven"" the idea that a student with a concealed handgun stopped the knife attacks. Then an Associated Press news story, published May 7, 2017, said that during the UT incident, ""no gun-toting student or professor pulled a pistol to stop the man in his tracks. No shots were fired and no gun was even drawn until police swarmed in to subdue the suspect."" No changes, UT says We asked UT if there were developments since the knife attacks suggesting a student with a gun helped quell the attacker. By email, Shilpa Bakre replied: ""This is an incorrect rumor."" Bakre said a UTPD officer ""took the suspect down and arrested him – no civilians with guns were involved. Police have interviewed over 40 witnesses thus far, as well as reviewed video footage to support this."" Our ruling A web blog said a UT student used a concealed gun to help police stop knife attacks on the campus.

"""We have counties where there have been one arrest under the SAFE Act. It indicates there's not a whole lot of interest in enforcing this in our upstate counties.""","Republican lawmakers in Albany are pushing a new proposal to repeal New York state’s 2013 gun control law, the New York Secure Ammunition and Firearms Enforcement Act, or SAFE Act. They want to repeal the law only in counties outside New York City. It would remain on the books for the city’s five boroughs. Marc Butler, a Republican Assemblyman from the North Country, claims the law is not effective upstate. ""We did a random survey of some of the counties,"" Butler said. ""We have counties where there have been one arrest under the SAFE Act. It indicates there's not a whole lot of interest in enforcing this in our upstate counties."" Is Butler right that some counties have only had one SAFE Act violation in four years? And is there ""not a whole lot of interest in enforcing this"" in upstate counties? The SAFE Act The SAFE Act passed the New York State Legislature in a whirlwind January 2013 vote, soon after 26 people -- 20 students and six adults -- were shot and killed on Dec. 14, 2012, at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. The SAFE Act places additional regulations on gun owners and dealers on what guns need to be registered, how guns can be bought and sold, and how those guns can be used. The law expanded the definition of what’s considered an assault weapon in New York state and required those guns to be registered. The law also required almost universal background checks on gun sales in New York state. The law requires anyone who wants to buy a gun to make the sale through a federally licensed dealer. Those dealers are required to perform background checks before approving the sale. Before the SAFE Act, residents were able to privately buy or sell guns without any background checks. Now, even if someone wants to give a gun to a family member or neighbor, it has to go through a federal dealer. Downstate arrests  Since the law's passage, there have been 11,893 arrests for SAFE Act violations in New York state through Feb. 17, according to the New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services. A disproportionate number of the arrests happened in New York City. Some 9,593 arrests were made in New York City compared with 1,641 arrests upstate and 659 arrests on Long Island or in the suburban Westchester and Rockland counties. New York City has the most SAFE Act arrests per capita with one arrest for every 692 people in the city. Long Island and the city's suburbs recorded one arrest for every 4,838 adults. Upstate arrests In upstate New York, there has been one SAFE Act arrest for every 3,411 adults since 2013. Erie County’s 254 arrests were the most among upstate counties. That's one SAFE Act arrest for every 2,870 adults in the county. Onondaga County had a higher SAFE Act arrest rate: one arrest for every 1,579 adults. Albany County had one arrest for every 5,400 residents and Monroe County had one arrest for every 3,514 adults. The arrests in most of those counties were concentrated in their largest cities. Buffalo had 78 percent of Erie County's arrests. Rochester had 81 percent of Monroe County's arrests. And, Syracuse had 87 percent of the arrests in Onondaga County. Albany County was the exception with only 48 percent of the county's arrests happening in the city of Albany. Some 172 arrests were in Oneida County, the fourth most upstate, and it had a rate of one arrest for every 1,066 adults.  Oneida County District Attorney Scott McNamara says he treats the SAFE Act like any other law. ""Whether I politically agree with a certain section of the law, or I don’t agree with it, I don’t let that affect what I do,"" McNamara said. ""What I do professionally and what I might think or talk about at breakfast with my wife are two different things. I leave my personal opinions to the side."" Eight counties, all upstate, had fewer than five SAFE Act arrests since the law took effect: Allegany, Chemung, Columbia, Hamilton, Schuyler, Wyoming, Tioga, and Lewis counties. Tioga and Lewis counties reported no SAFE Act arrests at all. Wyoming County is the only county with just one SAFE Act arrest. In that case, the offender gave a gun to someone not legally allowed to own one. ""We aren't seeing the violations,"" Wyoming County Sheriff Gregory Rudolph said. But law enforcement officials say they are not ignoring the law. People are obeying the law. ""To say our numbers are low because of lacking enforcement, we’re turning a blind eye? Never,"" Hamilton County Sheriff Karl Abrams said. ""It’s definitely less violators than downstate. They do everything by the book. They don’t do illegal transfers. They don’t do anything like that."" Our ruling Butler said ""we have counties where there have been one arrest under the SAFE Act. It indicates there's not a whole lot of interest in enforcing this in our upstate counties."" One county does indeed have just one arrest under the SAFE Act, and a handful of others have few arrests. But some upstate counties have large numbers of arrests. And even where there have been few arrests, law enforcement officials believe those numbers have more to do with residents complying with the law than authorities' lack of enthusiasm for enforcing it",Half True,"March 24, 2017"
"""Experts estimate that 40 percent of gun sales occur in no-questions-asked transactions that often take place at gun shows or on the Internet.""","Sometimes even a zombie statistic faces its moment of reckoning. Today is one of those days. Several advocates of gun control addressed supporters and reporters at a Florida Capitol press conference to promote two bills that would tighten background checks for firearms (SB 1334 and HB 1113), including the Senate bill’s sponsor, Gary Farmer, D-Lighthouse Point. Several of the speakers offered statistics on gun violence and public opinion about gun-related policies. One of those was Hannah Willard, the public policy director of Equality Florida. She said, ""Experts estimate that 40 percent of gun sales occur in no-questions-asked transactions that often take place at gun shows or on the Internet."" Willard pointed us to her source -- a briefing page about background checks published by the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. The page offers essentially identical language to what Willard said at the news conference:  To us, this was a familiar -- and imperfect -- talking point often raised by supporters of stricter gun laws. Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe earned a Mostly False when he used it, as the statistic stems from survey data undertaken in 1994 and that included firearms given as gifts or inheritances, not just sold. When the authors of the study -- Jens Ludwig of the University of Chicago and Philip Cook of Duke University -- adjusted the results to include only the guns sold, the number sold without background checks declined to between 14 percent and 22 percent. In 2015, Cook told PolitiFact that he and his co-author didn’t know whether their findings were relevant any longer, and added that no current national study had been published. We decided to check in again with the co-authors regarding Willard’s statement. Cook responded with some urgent news. ""We finally have an up-to-date survey that provides a good answer to the question of what percentage of gun transactions do not involve a background check,"" Cook said. Researchers Matthew Miller, Lisa Hepburn, and Deborah Azrael published a study in the January 2017 edition of the journal Annals of Internal Medicine that was specifically undertaken to update the 1994 data. The researchers asked 1,613 adult gun owners where and when they acquired their last firearm, including whether it was purchased, and whether they had either a background check or were asked to show a firearm license or permit. The answer: 22 percent obtained their gun without a background check. That’s barely half of the 40 percent figure that has gained wide currency for more than two decades. The 22 percent figure ""represents a smaller proportion of gun owners obtaining firearms without background checks than in the past,"" the authors wrote, though they emphasized that despite the smaller figure, ""millions of U.S. adults continue to acquire guns without background checks, especially in states that do not regulate private firearm sales."" When we asked Cook whether the new paper represented the definitive ""stake in the heart"" for this zombie statistic, he replied: ""Exactly."" In fact, Cook wrote an accompanying editorial in the journal, headlined, ""At Last, a Good Estimate of the Magnitude of the Private-Sale Loophole for Firearms."" In it, he wrote, ""Even though I bear some credit (or blame) for the earlier estimate, I could not be more pleased to be done with it, given that it is based on data from a survey done more than 20 years ago and that, in any event, never directly asked participants about background checks."" We will update with comment from the Brady Campaign if we get it. Our ruling Willard said, ""Experts estimate that 40 percent of gun sales occur in no-questions asked transactions that often take place at gun shows or on the Internet."" That statistic was already questionable, but by now it’s been definitively overtaken by a new study. The author of the old paper points to the paper published in January as the best estimate available, and it came up with a figure of 22 percent — just over half the percentage in the long-standing talking point",False,"March 16, 2017"
"""What has happened since 2005? We’ve seen violent crime continuously go down"" due to Florida's ""stand your ground"" law.","As one of the original authors of Florida’s 2005 ""stand your ground"" law, Sen. Dennis Baxley, has a long history of touting its success. Since the 2012 shooting death of Miami Gardens teen Trayvon Martin by George Zimmerman, opponents have pointed to an increase in justifiable homicides to argue against the law, which protects individuals who use deadly force in self-defense instead of retreating. Baxley, a Republican from Ocala, has repeatedly countered that argument and others by connecting the law’s passage 12 years ago with decreasing crime rates. He did it again in a March 15 debate on legislation that would shift the burden of proof from the defendant to the prosecutor in ""stand your ground"" cases. (The Senate approved SB 128 by a 23-15 vote; the House version has received the backing of one committee so far.) ""So what has happened since 2005?"" Baxley asked. ""We’ve seen violent crime continuously go down. Is that not the public policy result that we would want?"" When we examined a similar statement in 2012, we found that there had been a drop, but rates were declining before the law went into effect in 2005, calling into question what impact the law really had. Now it’s time to put this claim to the test once again, using updated data and research. Overall violent crime rate in Florida has dropped, but not every year Data from the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting statistics shows that from 2005 to 2015, the violent crime rate in Florida decreased by a cumulative 34.9 percent overall. However, if you look at the changes from year to year, the violent crime rate did go up three times — in 2006, 2007 and 2014. (And remember, the rate had been dropping for several years anyway.) Given that there is a certain amount of ""noise"" in yearly crime statistics, those spikes don’t really undercut the argument that violent crime has been dropping overall in Florida. However, the word ""continuously"" is too strong to describe the trend line. ""I do not think that is quite the correct word to use,"" said Bill Bales, a professor in the College of Criminology and Criminal Justice at Florida State University. However, Baxley's argument is not far off as long as ""the declines experienced were very minimal."" Other experts have offered a similar assessment in previous fact-checks of crime data. Alan Lizotte, a University at Albany criminologist, told PolitiFact last year that ""a small increase between two time points is not an increase when the 20-year trend is downward.  If it went on for several years, it might indicate an increase."" Impact of ‘stand your ground’ not proven The bigger problem is Baxley’s assertion that the ""stand your ground"" law led to a demonstrable reduction on violent crime. (He confirmed through an aide that that was his point.) In reality, violent crime in the United States has decreased since the 1990s, except for an uptick in the past two years that has come nowhere near erasing the previous quarter century of declines. Given that, it’s hard to separate the downward trend in violent crime in Florida from the decline on the national level, which was also mirrored in many individual states. ""I would posit that it has had little or no effect on any decrease,"" added Charles Rose, a Stetson University law professor. Baxley did not offer any evidence that showed ""stand your-ground"" had a demonstrable impact on crime. In fact, there’s actually contrary evidence. The journal JAMA Internal Medicine published a study in November 2016 that found that firearm homicides increased after the 2005 passage of the law in Florida. That’s a narrower measurement than violent crimes overall, but the findings shed some light on the issue. The study was done by David Humphreys of the University of Oxford, Antonio Gasparrini of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Douglas Wiebe of the University of Pennsylvania. They looked at trends for firearm homicides in Florida between 1999 and 2014. It found that after the ""stand your ground"" law took effect in October 2005, rates of homicide by firearm in the state significantly increased. ""These increases appear to have occurred despite a general decline in homicide in the United States since the early 1990s,"" the authors wrote. And states without a ""stand your ground"" law that were studied — New York, New Jersey, Ohio, and Virginia — saw no such uptick. ""Our findings support the hypothesis that increases in the homicide and homicide by firearm rates in Florida are related to the ‘stand your ground’ law,"" the authors wrote. Our ruling Referring to the year that the ""stand your ground"" law passed, Baxley said, ""What has happened since 2005? We’ve seen violent crime continuously go down."" Crime has gone down significantly since 2005, though ""continuously"" is overstated. Moreover, it is hard to pin the cause of the decline on the passage of the ""stand your ground"" law, since the decline in Florida has been mirrored on the national level. If anything, firearm-related homicides may have increased after the law’s passage, according to one peer-reviewed study",Mostly False,"March 16, 2017"
"""According to the FBI, Mexican drug cartels are working with 100,000 street gang members in Chicago alone.""","Echoing President Donald Trump’s views on criminal activity in the United States, the top executive with the National Rifle Association recently said crime is going up in many American cities and raised concerns about the role Mexican criminal organizations play. ""According to the FBI, drug gangs are expanding their networks all across the country. The FBI also says gang members are infiltrating law enforcement and even the military,"" Wayne LaPierre, NRA executive vice president, said Feb. 24 at the Conservative Political Action Conference. He continued: ""On the outside, gangs are committing more and more cross-border crimes. According to the FBI, Mexican drug cartels are working with 100,000 street gang members in Chicago alone. Think about that."" We were intrigued by LaPierre’s claim of Mexican drug cartels working with thousands of Chicago street gangs. An FBI report does offer this number, citing a media interview with a Drug Enforcement Agency special agent. But experts are skeptical about linking cartels to an estimated 100,000 street gang members in the city. National Gang Report The NRA referred us to a 2013 National Gang Report produced by the FBI’s National Gang Intelligence Center. It was compiled using surveys from the National Alliance of Gang Investigators Associations and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, open source reports and anecdotal information from gang investigators. The 2013 report affirmed that gangs in the United States have relationships with Mexican drug cartels and that they most commonly work with Los Zetas and the Sinaloa cartel. Specifically about Chicago: Mexican transnational criminal organizations ""partner with more than 100,000 documented street gang members in Chicago to advance their criminal activities,"" the report said. That statistic cites a September 2012 article from the conservative website The Blaze. The Blaze’s article centers on an interview with Jack Riley, then special agent in charge for the Chicago Field Division of the DEA. (The FBI referred our questions to the DEA.) Riley told the website the Sinaloa cartel likely had the strongest presence in Chicago out of all Mexican drug cartels. The cartels have made Chicago one of their main hubs due to its location, large Mexican population and high street gang activity, Riley told The Blaze. They also played a role in the city’s violent crime, he said. Regarding the 100,000 gang members figure, The Blaze reported: ""The drug cartels from Mexico have found willing business partners in more than 100,000 ‘documented’ street gang members in Chicago. The cartel operatives hide in plain sight, within the crowds of millions of hardworking Mexican citizens living in the city. ""It’s the perfect cover,"" Riley said. That number came up again in a November 2012 interview with the Washington Post. Attributing information to the DEA, the Washington Post reported that members of the Sinaloa cartel are selling record amounts of heroin and methamphetamine from Chicago’s Little Village neighborhood and that drugs then make their way to south and west Chicago in mostly African-American neighborhoods. ""Chicago, with 100,000 gang members to put the dope on the street, is a logistical winner for the Sinaloa cartel,"" Riley told the Washington Post. Experts weigh in John Hagedorn, a criminology professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago, raised questions about Mexican cartels partnering with 100,000 gang members in Chicago, as the 2013 report said. ""The cartels have organizations in Chicago that supply mainly Latino gangs largely through kinship connections. Black gangs here have largely shattered and are not major wholesalers in drugs,"" said Hagedorn, who has researched gangs for more than three decades. ""The statement that the cartels 'partner' with 100,000 gang members is untrue, to be charitable."" DEA’s Riley has long linked the cartels to Chicago’s high rates of violence, Hagedorn said. While the cartels deal mainly with Latino gangs, the majority of homicide victims and offenders in Chicago are African-American, he said. Fulton T. Armstrong, a research fellow at the Center for Latin American and Latino Studies at American University, also had doubts about linking Mexican cartels to 100,000 gang members -- almost 4 percent of Chicago’s estimated 2.7 million population, he noted. ""I find the 100,000 figure very hard to believe. Law enforcement routinely exaggerates both the threats we face and their performance dealing with them,"" said Armstrong, who formerly was a national intelligence officer for Latin America, chief of staff of the CIA’s crime and narcotics center and career CIA officer. Armstrong said that when he also worked on the staff of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he repeatedly asked the DEA, the Office of National Drug Control Policy and other agencies for information on the flow of drugs within the country, but was told the data wasn’t available. His last unfulfilled request was in 2011, Armstrong said. Cartels' continued presence in Chicago The Sinaloa cartel exports and distributes wholesale amounts of methamphetamine, marijuana, cocaine, and heroin in the United States, James L. Jones, public information officer for the DEA’s Chicago field office told PolitiFact. ""It maintains the most expansive international footprint amongst Mexican cartels,"" Jones said. It also remains the largest supplier of drugs to the Chicago area and uses street gangs for distribution, Jones said. ""Chicago is home to an estimated 100,000 active gang members that are heavily involved in drug trafficking, violent crime, and other criminal activity,"" Jones said. ""These gangs operate as the primary mid-level and retail-level distributors of drugs in the city and are responsible for a significant portion of the city’s violent crime."" But it is not clear whether the 100,000 active gang members are all linked to Mexican cartels, which is what is suggested in LaPierre's original citation of the FBI. We asked the DEA for clarification on an estimate of how many or what percentage of the 100,000 are working with the cartels. ""That’s tough to quantify,"" Jones said. ""However, we know that cartels are the source for the drugs that are being distributed by the street gangs in Chicago."" The 2013 gang report cited by the NRA is not the latest version of the report.  The 2015 report no longer references the specific figure, but also notes that due to new survey methodology, the 2015 and 2013 reports do not compare. The 2013 report also offers an overall cautionary note: ""Due to inconclusive reporting and lack of confidence in estimates collected from the (National Gang Survey), the (National Gang Report) does not contain numbers or estimates of gang members in the United States."" It recommends contacting local agencies for more information. We reached out to the Chicago Police Department for the estimated number of street gang members in Chicago and how many of them are believed to be working with Mexican drug cartels. The department’s office of news affairs said it did not have a way to immediately provide a count. (AP in January citing the Chicago Crime Commission reported that the city had more than 150,000 street gang members, but many are not active. In January 2012, the commission released a gang book estimating there were more than 68,000 gang members in the city.)  Our ruling LaPierre said,  ""According to the FBI, Mexican drug cartels are working with 100,000 street gang members in Chicago alone."" LaPierre cites data in a 2013 national gang report produced by the FBI’s National Gang Intelligence Center. But it’s hard to gauge how solid that figure is, and experts question its veracity. The figure tracks back to a 2012 interview of a DEA special agent in The Blaze. The DEA told PolitiFact there’s an estimated 100,000 gang members in Chicago heavily involved in drug trafficking. It’s hard to quantify exactly how many of them are working with cartels, though cartels are the source for the drugs distributed by street gangs in Chicago, the DEA said. Independent experts, meanwhile, are skeptical about generalizing that all 100,000 street gang members — Latino and non-Latino — are collaborating with cartels, since the cartels mainly collaborate with Latino street gangs",Half True,"March 14, 2017"
"""You can almost pinpoint half of the gun violence deaths to two or three specific sections in the city. They are just areas of devastation, economically and otherwise.""","Politicians and national media once again have turned their attention to Chicago’s violence. The city’s nearly 800 murders in 2016 prompted President Donald Trump to repeatedly liken parts of Chicago to sections of the Middle East. Trump also has said he will ""send in the feds"" to ""fix the horrible carnage,"" but no signs of federal intervention have been seen so far. Trump’s focus on Chicago, combined with the recent murders of 2-year-old Lavontay White Jr., 11-year-old Takiya Holmes and 12-year-old Kanari Bowers, has only heightened interest in what is happening in Chicago. The subject came up as MSNBC’s Willie Geist interviewed U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., on Feb. 15. Geist asked Durbin why Chicago is so violent, especially in comparison to other major cities like New York, which saw a historically low murder rate in 2016. (The Chicago violence segment starts at 3:54)  Durbin made the argument that Chicago, as a whole, doesn’t suffer from constant violence. He said the gun violence only occurs in a few areas. ""You can almost pinpoint half of the gun violence deaths to two or three specific sections in the city,"" Durbin said. ""They are just areas of devastation, economically and otherwise."" Is Chicago’s violence actually that concentrated? Murder across neighborhoods We reached out to Durbin’s office to see where he found this data. His press secretary, John Normoyle, pointed to a Chicago Tribune article published on Feb. 1 titled, ""Violence in Chicago still stubbornly high; Trump reacts again."" The story cites Chicago Police Department Superintendent Eddie Johnson who, during a press conference, said half of Chicago’s homicides in January occurred in three police districts: Englewood on the South Side and the West Side districts of Harrison and Austin.  We followed up with the Police Department’s News Affairs Office to verify that statement. The department’s director of communication, Frank Giancamilli, sent back a press release from Feb. 1 that says the Englewood, Austin and Harrison police districts approximately made up half of Chicago’s 51 murders in January. The distinction is important. Data from each police district crime map shows a total of 22 of the 51 January murders can be attributed to the Englewood, Austin and Harrison districts. It’s a significant chunk — 43 percent — but not exactly half. ‘It’s a tale of two cities’ Loyola University criminology professor Arthur Lurigio said violence in these areas is hardly news. Violence has been rampant in the Englewood, Austin and Harrison areas since the 1960s, Lurigio said. ""Without even seeing the data, I would have picked those three districts,"" Lurigio said. ""These communities haven’t changed, and I expect them to continue being this violent if they experience the same conditions."" This brings us to the second part of Durbin’s statement: The areas in which gun violence is concentrated are plagued by other problems that feed the violence. ""Homicide doesn’t occur in a vacuum,"" Lurigio said. ""Violence is a public health problem, but people only view it in a criminal aspect. People in these areas are plagued by other social, economic and health problems. Things like housing foreclosures, high unemployment and school closures. So a lot of young men devalue their own life because they don’t see a future. There’s no compunction about pulling the trigger."" There’s data backing up Durbin and Lurigio’s claims. According to U.S. Census data compiled by the Chicago Tribune, both Austin and Englewood have an unemployment rate of 21 percent compared to an 11.1 percent rate in Chicago overall.  East Garfield Park and West Garfield Park both make up parts of the Harrison Police District and have unemployment rates of 15 and 25 percent, respectively. Likewise, those neighborhoods have considerably lower individual incomes and higher percentages of households in poverty than Chicago as a whole. ""Chicago is like a tale of two cities,"" Lurigio said ""It’s a city that’s been utterly neglected in some parts. Give the city money to repair infrastructure where its needs it most. Fix the primary school systems in these areas. Don’t call murder a crime problem when the answers lie in investing in these blighted areas."" Our ruling In a recent interview with MSNBC, Durbin spoke about gun violence in Chicago. Durbin said of Chicago, ""You can almost pinpoint half of the gun violence deaths to two or three specific sections in the city. They are just areas of devastation economically and otherwise."" Durbin’s office cited a news article that used statistics from the Chicago Police Department. A press release from CPD News Affairs Office confirms this. It read: ""Three districts (7, 11, 15) are responsible for approximately 50% of murders in January 2017."" We confirmed these statistics by looking at data available on crime maps posted on the CPD Harrison, Englewood and Austin district websites. Durbin’s assessment of Chicago’s homicides is accurate. He did say you can ""almost"" attribute half of deaths to a few communities and 43 percent are in certain west and south side neighborhoods. A crime expert told us these trends have been consistent over the last five decades. Finally, we found data that shows there is a correlation between areas with high violence and economic hardship",True,"February 23, 2017"
"""Most of these mass shootings take place in (areas) where you're not allowed to have a concealed weapons permit.""","In the wake of mass shootings at the Pulse night club in Orlando and at the Fort Lauderdale airport, Florida lawmakers are expected to act on a series of bills to expand where people can carry their guns. The bills would allow concealed-carry permit holders to carry their guns in places such as airports, schools, college campuses, police stations and polling places. Florida leads the nation in conceal-carry permits with more than 1.7 million permits. Republican House Speaker Richard Corcoran supports expanding the list of where permit holders can carry their guns, possibly as a way to avert future attacks. (So does President Donald Trump, who promised to get rid of gun-free zones in schools and military bases.) ""Most of these mass shootings take place in arenas where you're not allowed to have a concealed weapons permit,"" he told CBS4 Miami’s Jim DeFede on Feb. 12. (By ""arenas"" Corcoran seemed to be referring to places in general, not sports arenas.) Corcoran argued that people who commit mass shootings say they chose certain areas because they ""knew nobody had guns."" That raises an interesting question, but it’s separate from the focus of this fact-check: whether most mass shootings happen in places where concealed carry permits don’t apply, or ""gun-free zones.""   Corcoran was citing research from a pro-gun advocate who reached that conclusion. But anti-gun advocates have argued that the data isn’t so clear cut; they see other patterns in the statistical evidence. Overall, the evidence remains murky and depends on how researchers define ""gun-free"" or ""mass shooting.""   Varying definitions of mass shootings Corcoran’s spokesman said he was referring to the numbers of mass public shootings compiled by economist John Lott, president of the pro-gun Crime Prevention Research Center. Lott’s research has been quoted by those who support expanding gun rights, but academics often attack his research as flawed. His book More Guns, Less Crime has been a subject of ongoing academic and policy debates as well numerous fact-checks. His book argues that crime data over multiple years shows reductions in crime in states that have ""right to carry"" laws. But many other academics have said his work doesn’t account for other factors that influence crime rates, and that he manipulates the data to reach his conclusions. The National Academies of Sciences concluded in 2005 that ""no link between right-to-carry laws and changes in crime is apparent in the raw data."" Before we delve into the numbers compiled by Lott, we will explain why it’s complicated to make sweeping claims of mass shootings in gun-free zones. There is not an agreed-upon definition of what constitutes a mass shooting -- even the federal government has cited various criteria at times. FBI spokesman Stephen Fischer pointed to a 2012 law setting the threshold for a ""mass killing""  as three or more people killed, but another report by the federal Congressional Research Service says that  ""mass murder"" has been defined generally as a threshold of four or more deaths. Lott points to the types of shootings the FBI included in this study of active shooter situations, but that study clearly says it isn’t covering all mass shootings. Lott said he included mass shootings in which four or more were killed that occurred in public, and he excluded those that occurred within the commission of another crime such as an armed robbery. Lott’s data showed that between 1988 and 2015, about 3.8 percent of mass shootings occurred in areas where guns were allowed. Everytown for Gun Safety found that among 133 mass shootings between January 2009 and July 2015, 70 percent took place in private homes while 13 percent took place in ""gun-free zones,"" where carrying of concealed guns were prohibited. Another 17 percent took place in public areas where the carrying of firearms are allowed. Daniel Webster, the director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, who has disagreed with Lott’s findings, pointed to research by Louis Klarevas, a professor at the University of Massachusetts-Boston. In Klarevas’ book Rampage Nation, he said that Lott has used too loose a concept of gun-free zones. Klarevas disagrees with gun advocates who define a ""gun-free zone"" as simply an area that bans private citizens from carrying a gun.   For example, Lott characterized Fort Hood and Washington Navy Yard, military sites attacked by gunmen, as gun-free despite the presence of armed security. ""There’s an obvious logical problem with such a conceptualization: How can a place be a gun-free zone if guns are present?"" Klarevas writes. ""The implication is that rampage shooters are only deterred by armed civilians, not by armed guards and cops. But that’s an absurd suggestion."" Klarevas uses three definitions: he refers to ""gun-free zones"" as places where civilians are not allowed to carry guns, and there aren’t armed personnel stationed on the property. He calls ""gun-restricting zones"" as places where civilians can’t carry guns, yet armed security is routinely present -- such as military facilities or certain college campuses. He refers to places that allow civilians to carry guns as ""gun-allowing zones."" Using these categories, Klarevas examined 111 shootings since 1966 in which six or more people had been killed in each incident -- regardless of whether it occurred in a public or private location or if it was in the commission of another crime. He found 13 took place in gun-free zones and five took place in gun-restricting zones. That means that the majority occurred in areas where there was no evidence that private guns were prohibited. Since Klarevas includes mass shootings in private residences or during the commission of another crime, that means that he counts several additional incidents that aren’t factored in by Lott. For example, as a mass shooting in a ""gun-allowing zone,"" Klarevas counts a gunfight between two rival biker gangs in Waco,Texas, in 2015 that left nine people dead. So that’s an example of a shooting that wasn’t in a gun-free zone that is omitted from Lott’s calculations. The two also disagree on how to characterize whether guns were allowed at certain locations. Lott says that the shooting at Umpqua Community College in Oregon was in a gun-free zone and points to a school policy that bans possession of firearms ""except as expressly authorized by law or college regulations."" Umpqua Community College spokeswoman Anne Marie Levis previously told PolitiFact Florida the school’s gun-free policy didn’t apply to students with a valid permit. ""UCC was never designated as a ‘gun-free zone’ by any signage or policy,"" she said. ""Umpqua Community College does comply with state law by allowing students with concealed carry licenses to bring firearms on campus."" Our ruling Corcoran said, ""Most of these mass shootings take place in arenas where you're not allowed to have a concealed weapons permit."" Corcoran cites research by an advocate for gun rights who used a strict definition to define places where guns were not allowed. In reality, there are places where concealed weapons are permitted, places where police or security officers openly carry weapons, and places where concealed weapons are not permitted. Additionally, there are different ways to define mass shootings. We found that advocates for more gun control analyzed the data and reached different conclusions. Our assessment is that it is difficult to draw broad conclusions about the motivations of the perpetrators of mass shootings or whether they are influenced by gun restrictions",Half True,"February 21, 2017"
"Says Neil Gorsuch ""comes down on the side of felons over gun safety.""","President Donald Trump’s Supreme Court nominee favors felons over gun safety, says House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. Pelosi said nominee Neil Gorsuch has ruled against liberal positions on a litany of issues like employee rights, food and water safety, reproductive rights and guns. Gorsuch is a conservative federal judge for the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals, based in Denver. ""If you care about that for your children, he's not your guy,"" Pelosi said during a Jan. 31 town hall on CNN. ""(Former Democratic Rep.) Gabby Giffords' group, the group for responsible solutions relating to gun safety, said that he comes down on the side of felons over gun safety."" Pelosi’s claim that Gorsuch ""comes down on the side of felons over gun safety"" caught our attention. Her office sent us a press release that Giffords’ gun control advocacy group, Americans for Responsible Solutions, put out along with the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. ""In his time on the 10th Circuit, (Gorsuch) made repeated efforts to weaken the federal law that’s prohibited felons from possessing guns for the past 50 years, a law that has saved thousands of lives and enjoys near-unanimous support among Americans and elected officials on both sides of the aisle,"" wrote Robyn Thomas, the law center’s executive director. It’s fair to assume that Gorsuch takes a right-leaning approach to the Second Amendment; the National Rifle Association supports him. But it’s misleading to say Gorsuch’s past rulings demonstrate that he thinks more felons should be allowed guns than what is already permitted under the law. Games-Perez The primary case in question is United States vs. Games-Perez. The defendant, Miguel Games-Perez, was a convicted felon, and he possessed a gun — an apparent violation of the federal law that bans felons from knowingly possessing guns. (Remember the word ""knowingly."") Games-Perez, however, wanted to make the case that he shouldn’t be convicted for this offense because he didn’t know he was a felon. He said that the state trial judge who ruled on the prior crime (the felony) repeatedly suggested to Games-Perez that he wasn’t being convicted of a felony but instead a lesser charge. In line with precedent, the 10th Circuit denied Games-Perez’s request. But Gorsuch disagreed. Gorsuch said he believes the federal law is written in such a way that a defendant must have both knowledge of being a felon and knowledge of possessing a gun in order to be convicted. Thus, Games-Perez should have the opportunity to make his case in court. If it’s decided that Games-Perez really didn’t know he was a felon, he shouldn’t go to prison on this charge. The upshot is that Gorsuch’s opinion did not say felons should be allowed guns or that the law violates the Second Amendment. It said a defendant who didn’t know he was breaking the law should have the chance to make his case in court instead of going straight to prison. He did, though, make the point that this is especially important in this case because possessing a gun is a constitutionally protected right. While this case has a gun component, Pelosi’s claim has it ""quite backwards because I don’t think Gorsuch’s opinion is about guns. For him, it’s about treating people fairly before sending them to prison,"" said Eric Citron, a partner at Goldstein & Russell who profiled Gorsuch for SCOTUSblog, and a self-described liberal. In theory, if courts adopted Gorsuch’s interpretation of this law, it could marginally weaken the federal law because some people charged with possessing a gun as a felon might successfully convince a jury they didn’t know they were felons and thus not go to prison for that offense.  But it doesn’t change the fact that felons are not allowed to possess guns, and people generally know whether they’ve been convicted of a felony. Adam Skaggs, litigation director for the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, emphasized the fact that Gorsuch’s reading of the statute deviated from the majority of justices on the panel, as well as other federal courts. And if Gorsuch’s opinion were to be adopted, ""The immediate effect is to create the possibility that this guy would be back on the street,"" Skaggs said. Reese Gorsuch’s 2014 decision in United States vs. Reese has also been cited against Gorsuch. But it takes a tremendous leap of logic to view this decision as an attempt to rethink the federal ban on gun possession by felons. In this case, a court had convicted defendant James Reese of being a felon in possession of a firearm. But Reese appealed the decision to the 10th Circuit and won because the state of New Mexico had restored his civil rights. If a felon’s civil rights have been restored under state law — including the right to vote, serve on a jury, hold public office and own firearms under state law — federal law allows the felon to legally own a gun. The 10th Circuit’s decision was uncontroversial. The opinion was unanimous and written in just 300 words. Even the government attorneys who brought the original charges conceded ""that Mr. Reese’s federal firearms conviction is unsustainable."" Had the court come to a different conclusion, it would have been ""appalling,"" said Eugene Volokh, a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, School of Law, who clerked on the Supreme Court with Gorsuch. Pope We won’t spend much time on this third case, United States vs. Pope. We wanted to note, though, that here, Gorsuch had the opportunity to address the question: Is there a situation in which the federal ban on gun possession by people with domestic violence convictions is unconstitutional? Here, he intentionally chose not to answer the constitutional question. Instead, he relied on procedural rules to affirm a grand jury’s decision to charge the defendant, convicted of domestic abuse, with violating the federal ban. Rule of law Volokh and Citron both noted a touch of irony: In both Games-Perez and Reese, Gorsuch advocated in favor of a big-picture principle generally associated with liberals more so than conservatives: defending the rights of criminal defendants. This is an area where the late Justice Antonin Scalia, whose seat Gorsuch might fill, found common ground with liberals, too. ""This is a standard liberal position historically,"" Volokh said. ""It’s a standard rule-of-law conservative position, as well. The criticism of (Gorsuch) for this is misplaced."" Skaggs sees it differently. He said Gorsuch is willing to ""bend over backwards"" to make rulings outside the mainstream opinion on the law banning felons from owning guns, noting that it’s important to consider whether Gorsuch would advocate for criminal defendants’ rights in the same manner in cases that don’t involve guns. Our ruling Pelosi said Gorsuch ""comes down on the side of felons over gun safety."" There’s one case, Games-Perez, where Gorsuch wouldn’t immediately send the defendant, a felon, to prison for having a gun, despite the federal ban on felons possessing guns. But Gorsuch’s reasoning wasn’t about whether the law infringed on the defendant’s Second Amendment rights. Instead, he thought the law allowed the defendant an opportunity to make the case in court that the he didn’t know he was a felon. Two other cases that came up in our research, Pope and Reese, turned out to be irrelevant. Pelosi’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression",Mostly False,"February 2, 2017"
"""I would imagine that there's probably a gun in the school (in Wapiti, Wyo.) to protect from potential grizzlies.""","President-elect Donald Trump’s pick for education secretary thinks some K-12 schools may decide they need a gun on campus — to protect themselves from bear attacks, for example. At her Senate confirmation hearing, education activist and major Republican donor Betsy DeVos mentioned a meeting she had with Sen. Mike Enzi, R-Wyo. He told her about a rural public school in Wapiti, Wyo., that has a fence surrounding the schoolyard to keep grizzly bears out. Later in the hearing, DeVos suggested a fence might not be enough. When Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., asked DeVos if she thinks guns should be allowed on school premises, DeVos said that decision should be left up to local lawmakers who might have specific needs. Like grizzly bears.  ""I would imagine that there's probably a gun in the school to protect from potential grizzlies,"" she said, referencing the school in Wyoming. We couldn’t bear not knowing whether the elementary school in Wapiti, Wyo., keeps a gun on hand to defend against grizzlies. So we called up Park County School District No. 6, which includes Wapiti Elementary School. ""No, we do not,"" said Angie Page, assistant to the superintendent, citing the district’s no-weapons policy. The entire state of Wyoming actually has a policy banning weapons on elementary, middle and high school campuses, state Department of Education spokesperson Kari Eakins said. Decisions about wildlife defensive measures are made at the local level and not reported to the state. Even though Wapiti Elementary doesn’t keep a gun for use against a grizzly, there really is a fence to keep bears out.   Wapiti, an unincorporated community with a population of about 165, is located on the edge of Yellowstone National Park. More than 700 grizzlies live in the Greater Yellowstone area, according to the National Park Service. The Wapiti school put up a fence to keep the grizzlies out of the playground in 2002, according to the Billings Gazette, a newspaper in Montana. Between 1990 and 2000, 16 grizzly bears were captured within a 4-mile radius of Wapiti, the article said. The Denver Post reported in 2005 that a Wyoming Fish and Game biologist had recently captured two cubs hanging around the Wapiti school, and that a grizzly hide was nailed outside of the principal’s office. Even after finding that DeVos’ claim was incorrect, we wondered if it’s advisable to use a gun when faced with a potential grizzly bear attack. Adult males can weigh up to 700 pounds and are about 3.5 feet tall at the shoulder.   ""Without question, guns can protect people from bears,"" said Tom Smith, a wildlife sciences professor at Brigham Young University. ""But, and this is a big but, to be able to use a firearm under duress effectively is limited to a very small group of persons."" Smith told us that people would be much better off using some sort of bear spray (about $40 on Amazon). It’s non-lethal to the bear, it’s less cumbersome than a gun, and because it creates a plume of spray, the user’s aim doesn’t have to be as accurate as it would be if he or she were using a gun. A study of bear attacks in Alaska found that in 27 percent of cases involving guns that failed, the person couldn’t get their gun ready fast enough to shoot the bear, according to an article Smith wrote for Alaska Magazine in 2012. Firing a warning shot was only successful at getting the bear to leave in 33 percent of incidents. ""So while some may carry firearms for protection, and it certainly is their right, the vast majority of persons would do themselves — and bears and quite honestly the rest of us — a big favor by carrying bear spray,"" Smith said. Our ruling DeVos said, ""I would imagine that there's probably a gun in the school (in Wapiti, Wyo.) to protect from potential grizzlies."" The elementary school in Wapiti certainly faces the threat of grizzly bears, given its proximity to Yellowstone National Park. It has a fence surrounding the playground to keep bears out. However, the state of Wyoming and the school district ban weapons in K-12 schools, so Wapiti Elementary does not have a gun on hand to defend against potential bear attacks",False,"January 18, 2017"
"""Florida is ranked 50th in the nation for mental health care funding.""","The suspect in the mass shooting at the Fort Lauderdale/Hollywood International Airport told the FBI in Alaska in November that he was hearing voices. Anchorage police confiscated Esteban Santiago’s handgun and took him for a mental health evaluation. Police returned his gun to him in December when he asked for it. On Jan. 6, he flew to Broward County and is the suspected gunman in a rampage at the airport that left five dead and several others injured. Days later, Democratic state legislators held a press conference in Tallahassee to argue for gun control measures and more mental health funding. Rep. Carlos Guillermo Smith, D-Orlando, said that Republican legislators argue that the way to reduce gun violence is not through gun control but mental health care funding. But Florida, he said, has the worst record in the nation in terms of funding mental health care treatment. ""We see once again Florida is ranked 50th in the nation for mental health care funding — 50th,"" he said. ""There is no one that is doing worse than we are when it comes to making sure we that we are providing comprehensive mental health care."" Florida is near the bottom of the pack in mental health funding, and one key ranking cited by many experts places the state at 51st in per capita spending. However, there are some caveats about the ranking. Comparing state mental health funding Smith pointed to news articles about Florida’s low ranking on mental health funding and data from the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors Research Institute. Mental health funding experts said they consider the institute’s data as the best source. The institute collects annual data on expenditures by state mental health agencies from the states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico. The total amount of expenditures is divided by the state population to compare the amount per capita. The most recent data, for fiscal year 2014, showed Florida ranked 51st out of 52 jurisdictions for total state mental health spending — behind 49 states and Washington, D.C. — at $36.05 per capita. The Sunshine State was only ahead of one jurisdiction: Puerto Rico, at $20.22. Florida has consistently been near the bottom of the rankings for years, said Ted Lutterman, senior director of the institute. In general, states in the northeast and northwest spend more, while southern states spend much less, he said. One key caveat about this data: It is based on money spent through Florida’s Substance Abuse and Mental Health Office, managed by the Department of Children and Families, and it doesn’t include services paid from other sources, including Medicaid or local funds, on mental health programs. ""Those additional funding sources aren’t reported to DCF, but they’re still used within the local systems of care to treat individuals,"" said Jessica Sims, DCF spokeswoman. The national research institute asks the state mental health authority in each state to provide information on all the funds used for its public mental health provider system, including state psychiatric hospitals and community providers. If another state agency uses Medicaid funds to pay for services directly and doesn’t work with the state mental health authority, then the state mental health authority will not have that data, Lutterman said. In most states, the state mental health authority helps manage the Medicaid funds. However Florida administers Medicaid differently, Lutterman said, and therefore isn’t able to report the Medicaid data for this report. The National Alliance on Mental Illness uses the per-capita state expenditures to compare rankings, said the alliance’s spokesman Bob Carolla. ""It reflects the relative degree of commitment to mental health by the state,"" he said. ""Medicaid dollars compared to Medicaid dollars could be a separate indicator, except I believe it’s more problematic because of the differences that exist between the state Medicaid programs."" Florida lags behind the majority of states on Medicaid spending per enrollee and the state Legislature rejected Medicaid expansion as part of the Affordable Care Act. Another way to examine mental health funding is to look at whether states are increasing the amount each year. The National Alliance on Mental Illness annual survey of state mental health care legislation doesn’t rank states but shows general budgeting trends. The 2015 report shows Florida maintained funding in 2013 and increased it in 2014 and 2015. Our ruling Smith said, ""Florida is ranked 50th in the nation for mental health care funding."" A key source of data for ranking states on mental health spending is the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors Research Institute. That data shows that Florida ranked 51st in 2014. However, it is difficult to compare Florida with other states because it administers its Medicaid program differently than most states",Mostly True,"January 18, 2017"
"""Since the Sandy Hook tragedy, more than seven children PER DAY have died from gun violence.""","U.S. Rep. Jackie Speier, D-San Mateo, is one of California’s most prominent advocates for gun control -- and one of the few members of Congress to personally experience and survive gun violence. Speier was shot five times at point blank range in 1978 on a trip accompanying Rep. Leo Ryan to Jonestown, the remote commune in Guyana where 909 people died from cyanide poisoning and other means. Speier was a legal adviser to Ryan, who along with four others were shot and killed in an ambush near the compound. Speier was rescued a day later. Since then, she’s spent much of her career in politics leading the call for gun safety. It was no surprise Speier spoke out against gun violence on Dec. 14, 2016, the fourth anniversary of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. The shooter killed 20 students, ages six and seven, along with six adult staff members in what’s considered the deadliest mass shooting at a school in U.S. history. On the anniversary, Speier posted an image on Twitter of herself holding a card reading #EndGunViolence. Above the image she claimed: ""Since the Sandy Hook tragedy, more than seven children PER DAY have died from gun violence."" We wanted to know whether the startling and somber statistic was true. We set out on a fact check. Our research A spokeswoman for Speier cited the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence as the source of the statistic. She said the campaign used information from an online database of fatal injury reports maintained by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We did not hear back from a spokesman for the Brady Campaign. But we found a similar statistic on the organization’s website: ""Every day, 7 children and teens die from gun violence."" The website notes that it crunched CDC data for children and young people through age 19. The federal agency is considered a leading authority on mortality and injury statistics. It includes data through 2015. To examine Speier’s claim, we searched the database for the number of young people who died in connection with guns from the start of 2013 through 2015. Those are the most recent available years following the Sandy Hook shooting. We found 7,838 deaths in connection with firearms for people ages 0 through 19. That works out to 7.15 deaths a day during this three-year period -- which matches Speier’s claim of ""more than seven"" per day. These include all types of gun deaths from accidents to homicides to suicides. About 36 percent resulted from suicides. Some might take issue with Speier lumping in 18 year-olds and 19 year-olds as children. Gun deaths for these two ages accounted for nearly half of the 7,838 young people killed in the two-year period. Here’s a look at the breakdown of deaths by age group: 0-4 years: 247 5-9 years: 218 10-14 years: 847 15-19 years: 6,526 The National Institute of Justice, a research arm of the U.S. Department of Justice, has stated that young people aged 15 to 24 are the group most at risk for gun violence. If considering only elementary school aged children, the total who die in connection with guns would be roughly one every four days -- still a tragic number, but not close to seven per day. We interpreted Speier’s use of the word children, however, to include a broader group of young people, including teenagers. Our ruling California Congresswoman Jackie Speier recently claimed: ""Since the Sandy Hook tragedy, more than seven children PER DAY have died from gun violence."" Speier’s claim is backed up by the CDC’s fatal injury report data, which shows an average of 7.15 young people per day, aged 0 to 19, died in connection with firearms between 2013 and 2015. It’s important to note these include all types of gun deaths: accidents, homicides and suicides. All gun deaths are violent, but Speier’s statement could be interpreted as only including homicides or accidents. Finally, Speier’s claim might also lead some to think she’s talking about young school aged children, given that she invokes an elementary school shooting. The data show teenagers and young adults make up the vast majority of deaths due to guns in America, while elementary aged children account for a small fraction. The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, the source Speier relied on, offers a more complete look at this statistic on its website. It notes that children ""and teens"" are included in the seven deaths per day. Speier’s statement is on the right track. But it could have used some clarifications",Mostly True,"December 27, 2016"
"Says President Barack Obama ""has not condemned"" shootings targeting police.","Larry Pratt, the longtime leader of Gun Owners of America, says President Barack Obama has been nonchalant about ambush shootings targeting police.   ""There have been officers simply gunned down because they had a uniform on,"" Pratt said during a Dec. 15 radio interview on WINA in Charlottesville. ""It’s not just Dallas, it’s other places as well and the thing that frankly concerns me as I think about this is that the president not only has not condemned this, he actually seems to have a rationale that maybe this is what you would expect in the United States with its history of slavery and racial impression and so forth. ""That doesn’t help in the here and now,"" added Pratt, a Republican who represented Fairfax County in the General Assembly in the early 1980s. ""We don’t have slavery and we don’t have racial oppression, but we do have cops getting killed."" We wondered whether Pratt, whose organization is headquartered in Fairfax County and has criticized the NRA as being soft on gun rights, was correct that Obama never ""condemned"" the murders of police. So we examined the records and found three statements by Obama that decimate Pratt’s claim. Dallas On the night of July 7, 2016, a sniper killed five Dallas policemen and wounded seven in the deadliest attack for police since 9/11. The assassin, before dying at the scene, said he was angered by the fatal police shootings of black men in Louisiana and Minnesota that had dominated national news in previous days. Obama denounced the sniper’s acts the next morning as ""a vicious, calculated and despicable attack on law enforcement."" He added, ""I believe that I speak for every single American when I say that we are horrified over these events and that we stand united with the people and the police department in Dallas."" The president also said, ""There is no possible justification for these kinds of attacks or any violence against law enforcement."" Obama was in Europe at the time to attend a NATO Summit and to hold meetings with leaders in Poland and in Spain. He cut short the trip by one day to speak at a memorial service in Dallas for the slain policemen. Baton Rouge    Three Baton Rouge law enforcement officers were ambushed and shot to death on July, 17, 2016. The assassin, who was killed at the scene, had vowed in an email to avenge the recent police killings of blacks. Obama issued a statement that day that said, ""For the second time in two weeks, police officers who put their lives on the line for ours every day were doing their job when they were killed in a cowardly and reprehensible assault. These are attacks on public servants, on the rule of law, and on civilized society, and they have to stop."" New York Two New York City policemen sitting in their patrol car were shot at point blank range on Dec. 20, 2014.  The New York Times reported that the murderer, who committed suicide near the scene, had made statements on social media that he planned to avenge police killings of black men earlier that year in Ferguson, Mo. and New York. Obama issued a written statement that day that actually used the word ""condemn."" He wrote: ""I unconditionally condemn today's murder of two police officers in New York City. Two brave men won't be going home to their loved ones tonight, and for that, there is no justification. The officers who serve and protect our communities risk their own safety for ours every single day - and they deserve our respect and gratitude every single day. Tonight, I ask people to reject violence and words that harm, and turn to words that heal - prayer, patient dialogue, and sympathy for the friends and family of the fallen."" We asked Pratt if he had second thoughts about his comment about Obama. ""Nah,"" he replied, saying the president’s statements deploring the attacks on police have been tempered by other comments Obama has made legitimizing the distrust many blacks have of police officers. For example, Obama said on July 7, 2016, that while most police perform admirably, there are racial ""biases, some conscious and unconscious, that have to be rooted out."" Pratt told us that Obama ""has stirred the pot,"" on attacking police. ""He’s looking for division."" We should finally note that Pratt is not the first to accuse Obama of being aloof about the attacks on police. Our colleagues at PunditFact on July 8, 2016, examined a similar comment by William Johnson, executive director of the National Association of Police Officers",False Pants on Fire,"December 27, 2016"
"California has seen a ""56 percent decline in the gun murder rate"" since the 1990s.","California voters added to what are considered the nation’s strongest gun control laws on Election Day by approving Proposition 63. The measure imposes background checks on ammunition sales; bans possession of large-capacity ammunition magazines; and forces owners to give up their weapons as soon as they can no longer legally possess them. Lt. Governor Gavin Newsom, who is running for governor in 2018, helped author the initiative and led the campaign for it. The measure had received nearly 63 percent approval as of mid-November, with some votes still uncounted. In a press conference the day after Prop 63 passed, Newsom made several claims about the effectiveness of California’s gun restrictions. ""We have significantly reduced the gun-murder rate because of our progressive gun policy,"" Newsom said, adding that California has seen a ""56 percent decline in the gun murder rate since we started to step up and step in and lead the nation in common sense gun safety laws, background checks, restricting large-capacity clips and the like.""  Gavin Newsom makes his claim about California's gun murder rate at about the 6:30 minute mark in the video above. We decided to focus on Newsom’s claim that California has seen a ""56 percent decline in the gun murder rate"" since it began imposing tough gun laws in the 1990s. Whether those gun laws are the driving force behind such a drop is a matter of mixed opinion. Gun rights groups say tougher criminal penalties, not gun laws, have led to the decline. PolitiFact does not fact-check predictions or opinions.  A Glock 30SF .45 Auto semi-automatic pistol with a Glock 13-round extension magazine installed, and 13 rounds of hollow-point ammunition are seen in Alexandria, Va., Wednesday, Feb. 10, 2016. (AP Photo/Cliff Owen) Our research The gun murder rate measures the number of gun-related homicides per 100,000 residents in a geographical area. A separate measurement, the gun death rate, takes a broader look including homicides, suicides and accidental shooting deaths. Based on our research and contact with Newsom’s campaign spokesman, it appears the lieutenant governor mixed up the two rates and ended up understating the drop in California’s gun murder rate by more than 10 percentage points. The state’s gun death rate -- not the gun murder rate -- dropped 56 percent from 1993 to 2013, according to figures provided by Ari Freilich, an attorney at the San Francisco-based Law Center for Gun Violence Prevention. The attorney cited age-adjusted data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The nonprofit law center advocates for gun control laws and is considered an authority on gun crime statistics. The law center’s figures do not include data from 2014, a year in which gun deaths and gun homicides continued to fall in California. Nor do they include statistics from 2015 and 2016, which are not yet available. Still, the 20-year span is the approximate period during which California imposed strict new gun laws, spurred by mass shootings years earlier on a Stockton schoolyard and inside a San Francisco law office. This meant the rate of deaths by any kind of shooting declined from 17.48 per 100,000 residents in 1993 to 7.68 per 100,000 residents. Larger drop in gun murder rate During this same period, California’s gun murder rate declined even faster: By 65 percent, according to a review of the CDC’s fatal injury reports by PolitiFact California. If 2014 is included, the rate dropped by 67 percent. Data from these reports have been cited by both gun control and gun rights groups to describe California’s decline in gun violence. They show gun murders fell from 9.60 per 100,000 residents in 1993 to 3.14 per 100,000 in 2014. In raw numbers, this means nearly 2,000 fewer people in California died in gun homicides in 2014 (when 1,233 were killed) compared with 1993 (when 3,183 were killed). Nationwide, the gun murder rate fell 45 percent during much of the same period. Between 1993 and 2000, it dropped from 7.0 homicides to 3.8 homicides per 100,000 people, according to a Pew Research analysis in 2015 of available federal data. Since then, Pew reported, the rate has remained relatively flat. Our ruling California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom said California has seen a ""56 percent decline in the gun murder rate"" since it enacted strong gun control laws in the 1990s. Newsom appears to have mixed up the gun murder rate with the gun death rate. California’s gun murder rate dropped 67 percent between 1993 and 2014, according to a review of fatal injury report data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A similar, though somewhat smaller, drop in the gun murder rate took place nationwide during this period. Newsom’s overall point is correct: Gun deaths, including gun homicides, have dropped significantly in California since the state imposed the new laws.   We are not fact-checking the cause of this drop. Gun rights and gun control groups have different opinions on this. What is clear is that gun homicides have declined significantly, and even faster than what Newsom stated. His claim needs this key clarification",Mostly True,"November 16, 2016"
"In Chicago, which has the toughest gun laws in the United States, probably you could say by far, they have more gun violence than any other city.","When professing his belief in protecting the Second Amendment, Donald Trump often has invoked Chicago as a place that proves gun regulation does not equate with reduced gun crime. He’s been making this claim longer than he’s been a candidate for president: The most stringent gun laws in the U.S. happen to be in Chicago - and look what is happening there! In his final debate with Hillary Clinton on Oct. 19, Trump repeated this statement: ""In Chicago, which has the toughest gun laws in the United States, probably you could say by far, they have more gun violence than any other city."" For Chicago, 2016 has been a year of record gun violence. The pre-Halloween weekend was the deadliest of the year, with 17 people killed. ""There have been at least 638 homicides so far this year, 217 more than this time last year, the data show. At least 3,662 people have been shot in the city, 1,106 more than during the same period last year,"" the Chicago Tribune reported on Oct. 31. As of Aug. 30, Chicago had more homicides and shootings than New York and Los Angeles combined. But does Chicago really have what Trump calls ""the toughest gun laws in the United States?"" The Trump campaign didn’t respond to requests for documentation. So to find out, we’ll look at ""gun laws"" from two angles, possession and sentencing of gun offenders. Possession For two years, Chicago did have the toughest gun possession law in the country. In 1982, the city banned possession of handguns by civilians, joining Washington, D.C., in prohibiting handgun possession. But the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2008 District of Columbia vs. Heller decision ruled the D.C. law unconstitutional, making Chicago the lone holdout among major cities for handgun prohibition. (A handful of Chicago suburbs had enacted bans along with Chicago’s.) But the Heller decision paved the way for the 2010 McDonald vs. City of Chicago decision that extended the Heller decision -- which had overturned a law specific to the District of Columbia -- to states. That meant Chicago no longer could ban handgun possession. Chicagoans, however, still faced stricter gun laws than residents of other major cities because Illinois was alone among states in not allowing concealed carry of firearms. Illinois became the last state in the nation to adopt concealed carry in July 2013, eight months after the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the state’s ban on concealed carry was unconstitutional. With that, Chicago lost its status -- or its stigma, depending on your perspective -- of having the strictest gun possession laws in the United States. In comparably sized big cities like New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco, the city administers the concealed-carry permitting process. In Illinois, the Illinois State Police processes applications, so it can be argued that Chicago has less autonomy in restricting concealed carry within its borders than do other cities. Illinois’ gun laws still are considered among the most restrictive when compared with other states. The Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, which advocates for gun control, gives Illinois a B+ and ranks it No. 8 in the nation on its ""Smart Gun Laws"" report card. The group lauds Illinois for, among several rules, requiring firearm owners to obtain a Firearm Owners’ ID card that includes a background check and imposes a waiting period on firearm purchases. But it also knocks Illinois for not requiring registration of firearms, for its lack of restriction on the purchase of multiple firearms and for not allowing local jurisdictions to regulate firearms. In other words, Illinois could make its gun laws much more strict than they are. Violations Another way to interpret Trump’s statement is that Chicago’s gun laws are strict because they impose strict penalties on those who violate them. But here, too, Illinois falls short -- much to the chagrin of Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel. Emanuel has argued for years that sentencing guidelines for gun offenders in Illinois are too lenient. The Chicago street gang members who have propelled the city to the top of the gun violence list, Emanuel has said, face harsher punishment from their gang leaders for losing a gun than for getting arrested with one. ""Let me remind you what one admitted gangbanger said in 2012 to a reporter. This is what the gangbanger said: that his gun possession arrest was a joke. Gangbangers know how to manipulate the criminal justice system, and they know its weaknesses first-hand,"" Emanuel said in a major speech Sept. 22 to address public safety in the city amid public furor over the Laquan McDonald shooting. ""Our criminal justice system is fractured, and it is undermining Chicago’s neighborhoods."" A Chicago Sun-Times analysis a year earlier had found that gun sentences for Chicago offenders were more lenient than elsewhere: In Chicago, felons illegally possessing a gun typically get four years, the Sun-Times found — toward the low end of the state sentencing guidelines. And those are the sentences judges hand out, not the actual prison time. Most people convicted of these gun crimes serve less than half of their prison terms because of ""good time"" that inmates can get credit for under state law, in addition to credit for time held in the Cook County Jail while awaiting trial. New York, by comparison, has a mandatory minimum prison sentence of 3 1/2 years for simple gun possession. In 2013, Emanuel pushed unsuccessfully for the Illinois General Assembly to impose mandatory minimum sentences for gun crimes. The effort was blocked by lawmakers concerned that it would lead to increased incarceration of young blacks and Latinos. Our ruling Donald Trump said, ""In Chicago, which has the toughest gun laws in the United States, probably you could say by far, they have more gun violence than any other city."" Chicago once had very tough regulations against guns, but they’ve been considerably watered down after the Supreme Court ruled that cities can’t ban handguns. Additionally, the state at one time didn’t allow concealed carry, and now it does. Its rules for allowing concealed carry are more relaxed than in California or New York -- states that allow local jurisdictions to regulate concealed carry within their boundaries. Nor are penalties for violating gun laws in Illinois the toughest in the United States. Mandatory minimum sentences make New York state’s laws tougher than those in Illinois. Trump’s statement contains an element of truth -- Chicago leads the nation for number of gun-related crimes this year -- but it ignores the fact that a U.S. Supreme Court decision and a change in state law brought Chicago in line with other cities on handgun rules",Mostly False,"November 3, 2016"
"Says of Donald Trump, ""He even said, on his very first day in office, he would require every school in America to let people carry guns into our classrooms.""","Hillary Clinton says that as president, she would ""tackle the epidemic of gun violence in America,"" while her opponent Donald Trump would ""do nothing."" At a rally in Cincinnati eight days before Election Day, Clinton explained how she and Trump differ on the issue of guns. The National Rifle Association endorsed Trump, and ""in return"" Trump has adopted various anti-gun control positions, she said. ""He’s even said, on his very first day in office, he would require every school in America to let people carry guns into our classrooms,"" Clinton said. ""How can anyone think our schools would be safer with more guns?"" We wondered if Trump really has said he’d put allowing guns in classrooms at the top of his priorities list. Throughout the election, he has advocated for getting rid of gun-free zones at schools and military bases, arguing that this could prevent mass shootings in these types of locations. And he did say once during the primary that he would get rid of these zones on his first day in office. ""I will get rid of gun-free zones in schools, and — you have to — and on military bases, he said at a Jan. 7 rally in Vermont. ""On my first day, it gets signed, okay, my first day. There’s no more gun-free zones."" The Outdoor Channel asked Trump about this plan in an interview two weeks later. ""I’m going to get rid of gun-free zones on military bases and I’m also going to do it in schools,"" he said, adding that he would try to ""work with the states"" or ""perhaps override the states if I have to."" The topic came up again in May, when Trump accepted the NRA’s endorsement. In the days that followed, he waffled on whether he wants schools to allow guns on campus. In his May 20 speech accepting the endorsement, he said, ""We're getting rid of gun-free zones, okay. I can tell you that. We're getting rid of them."" On May 21, Trump tweeted: ""Crooked Hillary said that I want guns brought into the school classroom. Wrong!"" He then made a seemingly contradictory claim on Fox News the next day, May 22: He doesn’t advocate for guns in the classroom, but sometimes teachers should have guns in the classroom. ""I don’t want to have guns in classrooms,"" he said. ""Although, in some cases, teachers should have guns in classrooms, frankly. Because teachers are, you know. Things that are going on in our schools are unbelievable. You look at some of our schools, unbelievable what’s going on. But I’m not advocating guns in classrooms. But remember, in some cases, and a lot of people have made this case, teachers should be able to have guns. Trained teachers should be able to have guns in classrooms."" We looked through other transcripts and interviews Trump has given since May, but we were unable to find further clarification about his position. His campaign did not respond to our request for comment. One final note: It’s highly unlikely Trump could let people carry guns onto school property on his first day in office. Regulations against possessing or firing a gun in a school zone is written into federal law and would take congressional approval to overturn. Meanwhile, states have their own laws prohibiting guns in schools that would need to be repealed, as well. Our ruling Clinton said of Trump, ""He even said, on his very first day in office, he would require every school in America to let people carry guns into our classrooms."" Trump did say once during the primary that he would eliminate gun-free zones at schools on his first day in office. He later said he thought that trained teachers specifically should be able to have guns in the classroom",True,"November 1, 2016"
"""With her solution, terrorists can still today — and by the way ISIS knows it, they have been advertising it — buy guns online and at gun shows in the United States of America.""","As gun policy takes a central role in New Hampshire’s U.S. Senate race, Democrat Maggie Hassan is warning that terrorists are trying to exploit federal laws to obtain firearms. Hassan brought up the point in the first televised debate against Republican incumbent Kelly Ayotte. ""With her solution, terrorists can still today — and by the way ISIS knows it, they have been advertising it — buy guns online and at gun shows in the United States of America,"" Hassan said on the debate stage at New England College. Is it really a point terrorists are spreading? Let’s look. PolitiFact has already looked into Hassan’s claim that Ayotte voted against a proposal to expand background checks and found it Mostly True.  Here we are going to look at what ISIS says about buying guns in America. Hassan’s camp pointed us to a series of news articles in which members of various terrorist groups talk about the ease of getting guns in the U.S. A former Islamic State recruit told the New York Times in August that the terrorist group tries to draw its recruits from within the U.S. because they can buy guns without a middleman. ""For America and Canada, it’s much easier for them to get them over the social network, because they say the Americans are dumb — they have open gun policies,"" Harry Sarfo told the Times from a German prison, when explaining attitudes within the terror group. ""They say we can radicalize them easily, and if they have no prior record, they can buy guns, so we don’t need to have a contact man who has to provide guns for them."" Hassan’s camp also directed us to a 2011 video featuring American-born al Qaeda spokesman Adam Gadahn in which he talked about lax gun laws in the U.S. and urged followers to take advantage of them. ""America is absolutely awash with easily obtainable firearms,"" Gadahn said, according to CNN. ""You can go down to a gun show at the local convention center and come away with a fully automatic assault rifle, without a background check, and most likely without having to show an identification card. So what are you waiting for?"" Gadahn was with al-Qaeda, not ISIS. Still, he urged terrorists to buy guns in the United States and use them against Western governments. Those two examples are enough to show that terrorists have advertised the U.S. gun laws, and ""it is something they think about internally,"" said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a terrorism specialist at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. Still, it’s difficult to determine if these are part of a widespread advertising campaign, or just isolated examples. A lof of ISIS communication is never circulated on the internet, Gartenstein-Ross cautioned. On other occasions, PolitiFact has examined whether people can buy guns without background checks. Currently federal law requires prospective gun buyers undergo background checks when they buy guns from federally licensed dealers -- but there are notable exceptions.  Anyone who repeatedly buys and sells firearms ""with the principal motive of making a profit"" has to get a dealer’s license, whether they deal out of a brick-and-mortar store, at a flea market, or online, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Licensed firearm dealers must run background checks on non-licensed buyers before selling them a gun. But the law does not require a dealer’s license for private hobbyists and others who occasionally buy and sell guns for the purpose of enhancing or liquidating a collection. So if an individual buys a gun from a hobbyist over the Internet, or at a gun show, he or she would not be subject to a background check. It’s worth noting that private sales, online or otherwise, cannot take place across state lines, so the buyer and seller must be in the same state. And there are many restrictions on shipping guns, so the actual transfer of the gun is likely to take place in person. Second, it is illegal for private sellers to transfer a gun to someone they either know or reasonably believe is prohibited from owning a gun, for example, if the seller knows the buyer is a felon. But online sellers ""can give themselves plausible deniability by not asking the necessary questions,"" Garen Wintemute, a professor of emergency medicine at the University of California Davis, has previously told PolitiFact. Additionally, several states — California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington — and the District of Columbia require background checks for all private gun sales. There is a sizeable online market for private, background check-free gun sales, according to a 2013 study by Third Way, a center-left think tank. Focusing on the website Armslist.com, a sort of Craigslist for firearms and accessories, in 10 states, Third Way found 2,000 ads from individuals looking to purchase guns from private sellers specifically. Congressional efforts to expand background checks for purchases made at gun shows or online have failed. A recent review by the New York Times found the majority of guns used in 16 recent mass shootings were obtained legally, including the attack in Orlando that left nearly 50 people dead. The shooter in that incident, Omar Mateen, pledged allegiance to the Islamic State before he gunned down patrons at the Pulse nightclub. Our ruling  Hassan said the Islamic State knows its followers can buy firearms ""online and at gun shows"" and is ""advertising it."" An interview in the New York Times with a former Islamic State recruit shows group members acknowledge American recruits can buy guns, so long as they don’t have a record. And a 2011 video from an al Qaeda spokesman urges terrorists to buy guns in the United States and use them against Western governments. There is little evidence to suggest a widespread advertising campaign, but it’s hard to tell, because not all ISIS communication is on the Internet, either",Mostly True,"October 24, 2016"
"Says Ted Strickland ""in this campaign bragged about his A-plus rating with the NRA. ... He has said he has a mixed and spotty record on this issue and that he can be criticized for it. Those are his words, not mine. So I don’t know where he is on this issue.""","Republican Sen. Rob Portman fired back at former Gov. Ted Strickland’s own words about gun rights during the final debate in Cleveland for U.S. Senate. The phrase he used -- ""mixed and spotty"" -- was featured earlier in the campaign season in an attack ad by Fighting for Ohio PAC, a political action committee that supports Portman. ""Gov. Strickland in this campaign bragged about his A-plus rating with the NRA,"" Portman said, when a question was posed to him about the candidates’ records on gun issues. ""I’m not talking about years ago, I’m talking about this campaign. He has said he has a ‘mixed and spotty’ record on this issue and that he can be criticized for it. Those are his words, not mine. So I don’t know where he is on this issue."" Here, we wanted to know if Strickland bragged about a sterling NRA rating in the same campaign in which he acknowledged a spotty record. When Fighting for Ohio PAC used the ""mixed and spotty"" line, we rated its ad False, because Strickland’s quote was misleadingly juxtaposed with figures about Ohio’s lost jobs and tax hikes under Strickland’s governorship. Portman is on firmer ground, because Strickland’s ""mixed and spotty"" remark did emerge in the context of guns. Strickland confirmed that he was running for Portman’s Senate seat on Feb. 25, 2015. In his 12 years as a U.S. Congressman, Strickland opposed measures to restrict gun ownership. So it was surprising to Ohio political observers when Strickland appeared at forums in Cincinnati and Columbus and talked up measures for more rigorous background checks and prohibiting gun sales to suspected terrorists. ""Ted’s views about gun violence and gun safety have been deeply influenced as a result of the multiple horrific incidents of gun violence that our country has suffered, and particularly after the Sandy Hook tragedy,"" Strickland’s spokesman David Bergstein told reporters Democratic primary opponent P.G. Sittenfeld questioned whether Strickland’s change of heart on guns was motivated by the tragedy or by political timing. A recording more than two years after the attack surfaced that Sittenfeld used to his advantage. On March 10, 2015, Strickland was a guest on WOSU’s ""All Sides with Ann Fisher,"" and took a call from a listener named Jeffrey. Caller: ""Hey there. Gov. Strickland, I know you are a big supporter of the president and when you campaigned for him in 2012 you wrote an article about his support for the Second Amendment. I was just wondering how you continue to say you support the Second Amendment when you have been lobbying for additional gun laws when you were working in D.C."" Strickland: ""Well, I have not lobbied for additional gun laws and, my brother, let me put my record in front of you. As a congressman, I had an A and most of the time an A+ rating with the National Rifle Association. That has been my position, and it is my position."" Strickland had to clarify his stance on guns in a Cleveland Plain Dealer editorial board interview of Democratic primary candidates for Senate in February 2016. It was taped, and is the source of the ""mixed and spotty"" line. ""Has my position changed over time? It has,"" Strickland said. ""My record is mixed and spotty and I can be criticized for that."" Our ruling Portman said Strickland ""in this campaign bragged about his A-plus rating with the NRA. ... He has (also) said he has a mixed and spotty record on this issue and that he can be criticized for it.""

"""What the District of Columbia was trying to do (with its handgun ban) was to protect toddlers from guns.""","Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton claimed that her opposition to the 2008 Supreme Court case of District of Columbia vs. Heller was due to a desire to protect toddlers from firearms. Clinton said in the third presidential debate that she supported an individual’s right to bear arms but disagreed with how the court interpreted the Second Amendment because it didn’t accept ""reasonable regulations"" on gun ownership. ""What the District of Columbia was trying to do was to protect toddlers from guns,"" Clinton said. There’s been a lot of discussion over how Clinton views the Second Amendment, but we were curious if she was accurately describing the rationale behind the case. The Heller case itself was a challenge to the Firearms Control Regulations Act of 1975, a broad ordinance passed by the Washington, D.C., city council that largely banned residents from owning handguns, automatic weapons and the possession of unregistered firearms, as well as requiring firearms kept in a home to be ""unloaded, disassembled, or bound by a trigger lock or similar device."" The handgun ban and subsequent gun control measures were widely considered to be one of the stricter rules on firearm ownership throughout the United States, though members of the D.C. council at the time said it seemed like the right thing to do. ""Handgun crimes were just getting out of sight,"" said Sterling Tucker, a D.C. Council chairman when the ban was enacted. ""We had to isolate and contain the problem. We thought a handgun law would do that."" Passed in the mid 1970s, the ordinance continued with several legal challenges until 2007, when a federal court invalidated the law. That decision was upheld in a 5-4 Supreme Court ruling that the handgun ban and ""trigger lock"" provisions of the ordinance violated the Second Amendment. Before the Supreme Court ruling, city leaders fought hard to keep the ban, saying that its continued implementation reduced the number of stolen firearms and guns used in other crimes. In their appeal to the Supreme Court, the city government filed a petition with the court specifically citing the dangers posed to children if the gun ban was lifted. ""The smaller the weapon, the more likely a child can use it, and children as young as three years old are strong enough to fire today’s handguns,"" the petition stated (page 25). The same petition also addressed the history of the ban, saying that in 1976 that the Council determined existing law didn’t sufficiently address gun violence and specifically cited the ""chilling regularity with which handguns were taking the lives of children."" But protecting children isn’t the only reason cited by the 30-page petition filed by the city’s government — the city also addressed general violent crime trends and other legal arguments in asking the Supreme Court to hear the case. And the court’s decision in Heller went far beyond just overturning the city’s gun ban, as it broadly affirmed for the first time an individual right to private gun ownership. Clinton’s campaign referred us to a gun control group claiming that gun locks and child access prevention laws help prevent unintentional firearm deaths for young children. PolitiFact has previously looked into whether the city’s gun ban had any effect on violent crime, finding that violent crime levels varied year-to-year and that other social and demographic factors played a larger role than gun laws. Our ruling Clinton said her opposition to the 2008 Heller case was because ""what the District of Columbia was trying to do was to protect toddlers from guns."" City leaders did specifically cite the danger posed to children in trying to keep in place gun regulations, but the regulations were also a widespread ban on unregistered weapons, not just gun safety measures. Child safety wasn’t the sole topic cited by defenders of the city’s gun control ordinance, and the Heller decision dealt with a much broader issue than protecting toddlers from firearm deaths or injuries",Half True,"October 19, 2016"
"""We have 33,000 people a year who die from guns.""","Early in the third presidential debate in Las Vegas, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton got into a back and forth over guns. At one point, Clinton said, ""We have 33,000 people a year who die from guns."" Is she correct? According to data from the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention, there were 33,599 people who died due to guns in 2014, the most recent year available. And the number has topped 33,000 for three years running. So Clinton has a strong point. That said, it’s important to note that she is bundling together homicides, suicides and other types of gunfire, including accidental discharges and legally permissible killings such as those by law enforcement. As the following chart shows, suicides account for the largest share of gun-related deaths -- about two-thirds in recent years. And while gun-related suicides have risen by 10 percent since 2010, the number of non-suicide gun deaths has remained roughly the same. Year Deaths by guns (including suicides) Suicides alone Deaths by guns excluding suicides 2014 33,599 21,334 12,265 2013 33,636 21,175 12,461 2012 33,563 20,666 12,897 2011 32,351 19,990 12,361 2010 31,672 19,392 12,280 Average per year, 1999-2014 31,102 18,223 12,879 Clinton phrased her statement carefully -- she referred to people who ""die from guns"" without specifying the circumstances of how they were shot. Still, the fact that suicides represent such a large share of gun deaths is a detail worth noting. Our ruling Clinton said, ""We have 33,000 people a year who die from guns."" She’s correct that all deaths from guns have exceeded 33,000 during the most recent three years for which we have data. That said, it’s worth noting that roughly two-thirds of these were suicides",Mostly True,"October 19, 2016"
"""During his 18-year Senate career, (Russ Feingold) supported judges who voted to deny your individual Second Amendment right. … (He) promises to protect those rights, but that's not what his record shows.""","U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson took aim at challenger Russ Feingold in a campaign ad on the Second Amendment. In it, Johnson claimed he will protect the rights of gun owners, but Feingold won’t. ""Your right to keep and bear arms, your ability to protect your family is at risk,"" Johnson said in the ad, which was posted online in August 2016. ""Sen. Feingold promises to protect those rights, but that's not what his record shows."" Johnson, a first-term Republican from Oshkosh, is mired in a tight re-election race with Feingold, a Democrat whom Johnson ousted in 2010. While carrying a shotgun in one hand and ammo in the other, Johnson in the ad references the vacant U.S. Supreme Court seat (""One more liberal justice will flip the court"") and says he has ""held firm defending the Second Amendment and will continue to do so."" Not so with Feingold, Johnson claims: ""During his 18-year Senate career, (Feingold) supported judges who voted to deny your individual Second Amendment right, and he’d do it again if elected to a fourth term."" That last sentence is key because it contains a specific factual assertion that Johnson uses to conclude Feingold would not protect the rights of gun owners — namely that Feingold ""supported judges who voted to deny your individual Second Amendment right."" Johnson also says that while Feingold ""promises to protect those rights,"" his voting record shows the opposite. But do the facts really support Johnson’s conclusion? Let’s take a look. Confirmation votes and court rulings When asked for backup, a Johnson campaign spokesman cited Feingold’s votes in the Senate to confirm the appointment of three U.S. Supreme Court justices — Stephen Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor — who dissented in major gun rights cases. In the 2008 case District of Columbia v. Heller, the Supreme Court held that the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution gives people an individual right to carry a gun for protection and is not merely a collective right tied to participation in a militia. Breyer and Ginsburg dissented, with Breyer writing he did not think the Second Amendment protects an absolute right to own a gun, but instead ""protects militia-related, not self-defense-related, interests."" (Sotomayor was not yet on the court.) Two years later in McDonald v. City of Chicago, the Supreme Court effectively extended Heller. The court ruled that the Second Amendment, through the 14th Amendment, applies to states just as it does to the federal government. Breyer and Ginsburg dissented here too, as did Sotomayor. (Feingold opposed the appointment of Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito, who cast a majority vote in support of both Heller and McDonald. The remaining Supreme Court justices who participated in those cases were appointed before Feingold became a senator in 1993, except for John Roberts, who is discussed below.) Thus, there is some truth to Johnson’s claim insofar as Feingold voted to appoint three justices who, after being confirmed, disagreed that the Second Amendment gives people an individual right to possess a gun. But here’s what Johnson left out of the ad: Feingold also voted to confirm judges whose decisions have strengthened gun rights. For example: • Feingold voted to confirm Chief Justice Roberts, who voted in the majority of both Heller and McDonald. • Feingold voted to confirm Wisconsin native Diane Sykes as a judge to the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. In the 2011 case Ezell v. Chicago, Sykes authored a court decision that invalidated a city of Chicago ban on gun ranges within city limits. • Feingold voted to confirm 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Thomas Hardiman, who in 2013 said the Second Amendment should protect an individual’s right to possess a handgun outside the home. • Feingold voted in 2003 to confirm 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Carlos Bea, who earlier this year joined a ruling that found a California county’s ordinance prohibiting gun stores from within 500 feet of residential areas violated the Second Amendment. And while Feingold has said he favors mandating background checks on people buying firearms at gun shows, he also has said he was pleased with the outcome in Heller and he has explicitly expressed support for an individual’s right to own a gun. ""I’ve long believed that the Second Amendment grants citizens a right to own firearms,"" Feingold said in 2010. Our rating In a campaign ad, Johnson said Feingold ""supported judges who voted to deny your individual Second Amendment right."" Feingold did vote to appoint judges who, after being confirmed, disagreed that the Second Amendment provides for an individual right to possess a gun. But Johnson failed to mention in the ad that Feingold also voted to appoint judges who have issued rulings strengthening gun rights. And Feingold has stated clearly he supports an individual’s right to own a gun",Mostly False,"October 19, 2016"
"Says Republican U.S. Rep. Bob Dold ""continues to side with his Republican leadership and the NRA in blocking consideration of a bill that would keep firearms out of the hands of people on the terrorist watch list.""","As the race for Illinois’ 10th District seat enters its home stretch, the debate over gun control remains one of the central issues between Republican U.S. Rep. Bob Dold and Democratic challenger Brad Schneider. On Sept. 16, Schneider tweeted a request for supporters to sign a petition asking Dold to stop blocking a vote on gun safety legislation. On Sept. 27, Schneider's campaign announced that the petition had gained more than 600 signatures. In the text of the petition, Schneider's campaign wrote: ""Republican Bob Dold refuses to sign a Congressional petition that would force Speaker Ryan to allow a vote on commonsense gun safety legislation. Instead, Dold continues to side with his Republican leadership and the NRA in blocking consideration of a bill that would keep firearms out of the hands of people on the terrorist watch list."" Let’s unpack that a little bit. ‘No fly, no buy’ At the heart of this claim is the debate surrounding the so-called ""No Fly, No Buy"" bill, officially known as H.R. 1076. As its title suggests, the bill aims to ban the sale of firearms to people who are on the FBI terrorist watchlist. First introduced in February 2015, the bill has been stalled in Congress since December 2015. Democrats have been using various procedural methods to try to move the bill forward. Schneider said Dold has refused to sign a congressional petition that would force a vote on H.R. 1076 and ""continues to side with… the NRA"" in obstructing the bill. We found that claim curious because Dold is one of the co-sponsors of H.R. 1076 and he has received an ""F"" rating from the National Rifle Association for his voting record on gun rights. The petition to force a vote on it currently has 181 signatures, which is 37 short of the required 218. It is true that Dold did not sign the petition. Democrats also have used ""orders for the previous question"" and motions to recommit to try and bring the bill to the floor. Put simply, an ""order for the previous question"" is a vote on whether or not to change the agenda and consider alternate legislation. A ""motion to recommit with instructions forthwith"" allows a member of the minority to add an amendment to a piece of legislation just before a vote. Schneider’s campaign offers a list of 25 instances when the Democrats presented either an order for a previous question or a motion to recommit to bring H.R. 1076 to the floor. (Since they first sent us the list, there have been an additional three orders for a previous question). The campaign points out that in each of these instances, Dold sided with the ""Republican leadership and the NRA"" in order to block consideration of H.R. 1076. We looked at each of the 25 instances cited by Schneider’s campaign, and indeed Dold’s voting record was not in favor of bringing H.R. 1076 to the floor for consideration. However, that is not the full story. Dold’s gun control record Dold, who is facing Schneider for the third consecutive time, said Schneider was distorting his record. ""While we have all grown accustomed to the shameless lies from Brad Schneider and his campaign, Brad's incredibly dishonest attacks against my record of championing common-sense gun legislation are sadly another example of the worst kind of politics that the 10th District and the American people are completely tired of."" Dold is referring to his record in co-sponsoring the Zero Tolerance for Domestic Abusers Act, as well as his co-sponsorship of the aforementioned H.R. 1076. He has also spoken on the House floor in favor of reducing gun violence following the Orlando shooting this past summer. Since part of the claim said Dold was siding with the National Rifle Association, we also looked at the gun lobby’s report card and found Dold received an ""F,"" a grade the NRA uses to label those they consider a ""true enemy of gun owner’s rights."" Schneider also has got an ""F"" rating. However, Schneider spokesman Steven Kirsch, while acknowledging Dold’s co-sponsorship of H.R. 1076, said, ""Democrats are using every tool available to try to force a vote on gun safety legislation. But instead of taking action in favor of the legislation he claims to support, Congressman Bob Dold sides time and time again with his Republican Party to prevent even having a vote. … Until Dold shows he is willing to take action alongside those fighting to a get a vote on this critical legislation instead of continuing to side with his party, his words of support remain just that – words."" Some additional caveats Neither orders for previous questions nor motions to recommit are as clear cut as they first seem. Both Republicans and Democrats, when they are in the minority, claim that previous questions have ""substantive policy implications."" At the same time, both call out the opposing majority party for claiming that previous questions are purely procedural votes. So which is it? We asked Josh Chafetz, a professor of law at Cornell Law School. He confirmed that this can be tricky: ""You can't separate procedure and substance, so the votes usually are good proxies for someone's substantive stance, BUT it can be very, very difficult to untangle exactly what the substantive consequences of a particular vote are. ... Basically, without getting deep into the weeds of a particular series of votes, you can't really say definitively what the substantive implications of a vote were."" Similar statements have been made about motions to recommit. In a 2012 interview with PolitiFact Wisconsin, Donald Wolfensberger, who currently is a fellow at the Bipartisan Policy Center and served as a key Republican staffer in the 1990s, said ""both parties, when in the minority, have used (motions to recommit) to make political statements and embarrass the majority for partisan advantage. It is well understood in modern times that these are designed for partisan campaign purposes and usually have little to do with better policy."" Our ruling Dold has not signed the discharge petition for the ""No Fly, No Buy"" bill, and his voting record (as demonstrated through previous questions and motions to recommit) has not helped to progress a vote on the bill. However, there are additional details worth considering that the claim does not mention. Dold is a co-sponsor of the ""No Fly, No Buy"" bill itself, and his past record has caused the NRA to label him a ""true enemy of gun owner’s rights."" There also is some ambiguity on the intention behind procedural maneuvers. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important information",Half True,"October 18, 2016"
"Hillary Clinton said gun confiscation ""would be worth considering.""","A National Rifle Association flier shows the jaws of a crane dumping hundreds of rifles into a landfill. ""What did Hillary Clinton say when she was asked about gun confiscation in America?"" it asks in capital letters. The flier answers the question with this Clinton quote: ""I think it would be worth considering doing it on a national level, if that can be arranged."" Next to the quote is a photo of a strident-looking Clinton speaking into a microphone. We examined whether Clinton really did say that U.S. gun confiscation is ""worth considering."" The flier was issued by the NRA’s lobbying arm, the Institute for Legislative Action. It says Clinton made the statement during a town hall campaign event in Keene, N.H., on Oct 16, 2015. She was asked whether she’d support a national gun buyback program similar to one Australia instituted in 1996 after a mass shooting in Tasmania left 35 dead. A month later, Australia banned semi-automatic and self-loading rifles as well as shotguns. The government offered a one-year grace period during which it would buy back the firearms at fair-market prices. After that, people possessing the weapons would subject to strict penalties. The buyback program resulted in more than 640,000 prohibited weapons being turned in - roughly one-fifth of all the guns then estimated to be in Australia. Now, let’s go back to the New Hampshire town hall meeting. A tape shows a man asked Clinton this question: ""Australia managed to take away tens of thousands - millions - of handguns and in one year they were all gone. Can we do that and why? If we can’t, why not? (The questioner was wrong in saying the buyback pertained to handguns; it didn’t.) Clinton replied that several nations have tightened their gun laws after experiencing mass shootings. ""In the Australian example, as I recall, that was a buyback program,"" she said. ""The Australian government, as part of trying to clamp down on the availability of automatic weapons, offered a good price for buying hundreds of thousands of guns and then they basically clamped down going forward in terms of, you know, more of a background check, more of a permitting approach. ""But they believed, and I think the evidence supports them, that by offering to buy back those guns they were able to, you know, curtail the supply and set a different standard for gun purchases in the future."" ""Now (U.S.) communities have done that; communities have done gun buyback programs. But I think it would be worth considering doing that on the national level if that could be arranged."" Clinton mentioned ""cash for clunkers,"" the nickname of a 2009 voluntary program in which the U.S. government briefly offered payments to people wishing to trade in old, gas-guzzling vehicles. ""So I think that’s worth considering,"" Clinton said. ""I don’t know enough details to tell you how we would do it or how it would work. But certainly, the Australian example is worth considering."" The NRA and other pro-gun groups instantly seized on Clinton’s comment, saying the buyback program Clinton lauded is tantamount to a confiscation program, because it backed many gun owners into a corner: They either could sell their firearms to the government or risk prosecution for keeping them. It was, the NRA says, ""an offer gun owners could not refuse."" Three days after the New Hampshire event, the Clinton campaign said the candidate opposes gun confiscation and accused the NRA of distorting her comments. ""Of course Hillary does not support national mandatory gun buyback programs, including those modeled after Australia's program,"" spokesman Josh Schwerin wrote to us in an email. ""She was discussing voluntary buyback programs, which are drastically different than what occurred in Australia and are regularly run by cities across the America."" We asked the NRA if it had any other evidence that it believes shows Clinton is open to gun confiscation. A spokeswoman for the gun group’s lobbying arm questioned whether that was ""relevant"" to our fact-check and didn’t provide an answer. Our ruling The NRA says that when Clinton was asked about gun confiscation, she said ""I think it would be worth doing it on a national level, if that can be arranged."" Clinton made that statement last year at a New Hampshire campaign stop, when she was asked a vague question about an Australian program that gave gun owners one year to sell certain firearms to the government before those weapons became illegal. She left the NRA some room. But the NRA stretches her words to an almost unrecognizable form. Clinton focused her comments on voluntary buyback programs similar to those some U.S. communities have instituted for guns and the federal ""cash-for-clunkers"" program. She was ambiguous about how a U.S. guns buyback program might be structured, saying ""I don’t know enough details to tell you how we would do it or how it would work."" And her campaign since has said she opposes gun confiscation. So there’s an element of truth to the NRA’s statement, but it ignores critical facts that would give a different impression",Mostly False,"October 17, 2016"
"Says Patrick Murphy ""supports a gun ban on commonly owned semi-automatic firearms used for hunting, recreational shooting and self defense.""","The National Rifle Association is firing allegations at U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy, saying the Democratic Senate hopeful wants to take away voters’ guns. The gun rights group’s lobbying arm, the Institute for Legislative Action, attacked Murphy in a mailer we received on Oct. 4, 2016. The flier listed several reasons why Murphy is against guns. ""Murphy supports a gun ban on commonly owned semi-automatic firearms used for hunting, recreational shooting and self defense,"" one of the items read. That sounds like Murphy, now running against incumbent Marco Rubio for U.S. Senate, wants to make it illegal to own a wide range of weapons, so we zeroed in on that statement. ‘Military-style weapons of war’ Murphy has been an advocate of stricter gun control, especially in the wake of the June 12, 2016, mass shooting at Pulse nightclub in Orlando. Omar Mateen killed 49 people and wounded 53 others using a semi-automatic rifle and handgun. Murphy called for keeping ""assault weapons out of the hands of dangerous people."" In an August 2016 candidate survey, Murphy told the Tampa Bay Times he does not believe ""that civilians need access to military-style assault weapons."" In September, he told the Orlando Sentinel he agreed with the families of the Pulse victims who wanted Congress to ban weapons like the rifle Mateen used. Murphy said the government should ""keep military-style weapons of war out of our communities and out of the hands of criminals and terrorists."" Murphy’s campaign did not provide any specifics about what types of guns, other than to call them ""military-style assault rifles"" and ""dangerous weapons of war."" Technically there’s no true definition of what makes a particular rifle an ""assault weapon."" There’s no clear, legal interpretation of any of the descriptions Murphy and other gun control advocates are using, giving the NRA wide berth in its attack. Put simply, the term ""semi-automatic"" refers to any firearm designed to fire one bullet with one trigger squeeze, then automatically reload the chamber and be ready to fire again. This is different from an automatic weapon, in which squeezing the trigger once fires multiple times until the shooter lets go. Automatic weapons sales have been restricted in the United States since 1934. Regulations put in place in 1986 made it much more difficult for civilian buyers to get an automatic weapon. Experts told us that while legislators have struggled for decades to find a universal term that fits the mold, in general that means so-called black rifles that look like a soldier’s weapon. These include rifles that have pistol grips, high-capacity magazines, bayonet lugs to fix edged weapons, flash suppressors at the end of the barrel and so forth. The NRA-ILA told us Murphy and others usually are referring to rifles similar to the AR-15, which is a derivative of a rifle first developed by gunmaker ArmaLite in the 1950s. (The AR refers to ArmaLite rifle, and does not stand for ""assault rifle."") There are somewhere between 6 million and 10 million of these semi-automatic rifles in circulation in the United States. The NRA routinely refers to this style of semi-automatic weapon — used in shootings in Aurora, Colo.; Roseburg, Ore.; San Bernadino, Calif.; and Newtown, Conn. — as a ""modern sporting rifle."" One of Mateen’s weapons in the Pulse shooting, a Sig Sauer MCX, is similar in style to an AR-15 but not the same design. Internally, however, the consumer versions of these rifles basically work the same as any other semi-automatic rifle. Cartridges are fed from magazines and are fired one at a time with each trigger pull. They are used for self-defense and recreational shooting, just as the NRA said. About half of all guns are semi-automatic. Handguns are far more prevalent in crimes. The 2007 Virginia Tech shootings, for example, were committed with two semi-automatic handguns, a Glock 19 and Walther P22, she said. Mateen also used a Glock 17 pistol. Tomislav Kovandzic, a University of Texas at Dallas professor who teaches classes on research methods and gun control, said many lawmakers resort to focusing on specific makes and models that usually are both semi-automatic and considered military in appearance. That’s what the 1994-2004 federal assault weapons ban did. Kovandzic said in the research he’s seen, these types of ""assault weapons"" are used in less than 2 percent of gun crimes. Of course, the NRA words the claim in such a way that there could be some confusion about Murphy’s wishes. While Murphy is focusing on rifles that are arguably only cosmetically different, his intention is a bit obscured by the mailer. ""He may want to ban some semi-automatic weapons,"" UCLA constitutional law professor Adam Winkler said, ""but he doesn’t want to ban all semi-automatic weapons."" Our ruling The NRA-ILA said, ""Murphy supports a gun ban on commonly owned semi-automatic firearms used for hunting, recreational shooting and self defense."" Murphy has called for a ban on ill-defined ""military-style weapons of war"" and ""assault weapons."" His campaign didn’t specify further which guns, but these political terms usually refer to rifles used in some mass shootings with mostly cosmetic differences from other semi-automatic rifles. These rifles, often based on the AR-15, are used by owners in the way the NRA describes. But the mailer could be construed as saying Murphy wants to take away most, if not all, semi-automatic firearms, which Murphy denies",Mostly True,"October 11, 2016"
"""You would receive a citation for taking a dildo to class"" at the University of Texas.","A student group at the University of Texas at Austin warned of legal repercussions for taking sex toys to class. The group, Cocks Not Glocks, was founded to highlight what protesters depicted as the absurdity of Texas’ campus carry law, Senate Bill 11, which as of Aug. 1, 2016 newly allowed students at public colleges and universities to bring concealed firearms into classrooms and campus buildings, except in areas excluded by school rules. Since 1995, licensed individuals had been allowed to carry concealed handguns onto public college and university grounds.   On Aug. 24, 2016, UT’s first day of fall-semester classes, Cocks Not Glocks drew wide attention when it distributed about 4,000 dildos on campus in a show of opposition to campus carry. The group wrote on its Facebook event page, which showed almost 10,000 people pledging to attend the dildo distribution on the university’s Main Mall: ""The State of Texas has decided that it is not at all obnoxious to allow deadly concealed weapons in classrooms, however it DOES have strict rules about free sexual expression, to protect your innocence. ""You would receive a citation for taking a DILDO to class before you would get in trouble for taking a gun to class,"" the entry said. We’ve looked into the campus carry debate before, finding True a professor’s claim that prospective job applicants, students and guest speakers had decided to steer clear of the university out of concern concealed weapons might be present. But could one really get a citation for taking a dildo to class? A reader exhorted us to check. Group points to state obscenity law We messaged the Cocks Not Glocks Facebook page to ask for the basis of the citation claim and got a response from group founder and former student Jessica Jin, who wrote: ""UT school rules cite Texas state law when it comes to obscenities and state law says that openly brandishing/distributing/promoting a phallic object in public is an offense."" So a student who carried a concealed dildo to class, she acknowledged, ""of course wouldn't be in any sort of trouble."" Jin continued: ""Our demonstration, which could be seen as an act of performance art also, if it weren't covered by free speech and demonstration protections that superseded state obscenity clauses, would have qualified as an obscenity in Texas."" Specifically, she pointed us to the Texas Penal Code chapter 43, titled ""public indecency,"" sections 21 and 22. So we pulled up the Texas Penal Code, noting section 43.21, which states that material qualifies as ""obscene"" if: —""The average person, applying contemporary community standards, would find that taken as a whole appeals to the prurient interest in sex."" --It ""depicts or describes… the male or female genitals in a state of sexual stimulation or arousal… or a device designed and marketed as useful primarily for stimulation of the human genital organs…"" --""Taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, and scientific value."" Next, section 43.22 of the code states that ""a person commits an offense if he intentionally or knowingly displays or distributes an obscene photograph, drawing, or similar visual representation or other obscene material and is reckless about whether a person is present who will be offended or alarmed by the display or distribution."" ""An offense under this section is a Class C misdemeanor,"" it states. We looked up penal code chapter 12, ""punishments,"" and found that a Class C misdemeanor is punishable by a fine of up to $500. Jin also told us that UT school rules cite state law as the basis for outlawing dildos. In the 207-page ""general information"" catalog, we flipped to subchapter 13-200, ""prohibited expression,"" then to section 13-201, ""obscenity,"" which states: ""No person or organization will distribute or display on the campus any writing or visual image, or engage in any public performance, that is obscene. A writing image or performance is ‘obscene’ if it is obscene as defined in Texas Penal Code, Section 43.21 or successor provisions…"" No evidence of citations So it looked like there’s a risk of getting into trouble for brandishing a dildo in class. So, can and would such tickets be issued? Our search of the Lexis Nexis news database didn’t turn up instances of Texans getting prosecuted for brandishing dildos. Across the board, the only apparent prosecutions for sex toy crimes were made under a state law, overturned in 2008, which banned the sales of ""obscene"" items. We emailed the University of Texas and asked if students would indeed receive a citation for taking a dildo to class, as school rules seemed to indicate. A top  spokesman, J.B. Bird, responded by email that the university couldn’t speculate about a ""hypothetical situation."" Bird wrote: ""The university works carefully to enforce its policies based on facts. In First Amendment situations, context also matters tremendously."" So, maybe no citations. Then again, Bird wrote: ""I can tell you that the university does enforce its rules."" Speaking to the distribution of dildos by Cocks Not Glocks at the start of the fall 2016 semester, Bird said no tickets were issued because ""the protests around campus carry earlier this year appeared to be examples of protected political speech."" Reminder: The Texas penal code (based on the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court Ruling Miller v. California) exempted material from obscenity restrictions unless it lacks ""serious"" political value. From outside UT, we heard back from the  University of Houston Law Center, which referred our questions about whether citations would be issued for classroom dildos to Peter Linzer, a professor of constitutional law, who wrote back that there is no ""definitive answer"" on the legality of toting dildos into classrooms because two portions of relevant state law make the offense situational: ""lacks serious, literary, artistic, political and scientific value"" and ""is reckless about whether a person is present who will be offended."" ""Tell the students to ask if anyone is offended,"" Linzer wrote. ""A cop would make a fool of himself (by issuing a citation) and I doubt that the Travis County DA would prosecute."" Our attempt to elicit comment from Rosemary Lehmberg, the Travis County district attorney, ran aground. By email, she said her office only prosecutes felony charges. To get a fix on misdemeanor prosecutions such as citations for dildo possession, Lehmberg suggested we reach out to the city’s municipal courts. There, we were unable to identify anyone who could speak to charges leveled for wielding dildos on campus. Our ruling Cocks Not Glocks said students would get citations for taking dildos to class. Texas obscenity law allows citations to be issued to dildo toters provided the dildo is displayed and the person doing so is reckless about who could be offended and the display lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value. That said, we failed to identify any instance of such a ticket being issued nor did UT officials say it was likely to happen--which leaves such a citation hypothetical and situational, it seems to us",Half True,"October 7, 2016"
"""In the state legislature, I supported Second Amendment rights.""","In a September campaign TV spot that has gained national attention, Jason Kander assembles a military assault rifle while blindfolded. Kander, who is Missouri’s secretary of state and a Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate, puts together an AR-15 in 30 seconds. As he assembles the gun, he talks about how his opponent, Republican Roy Blunt, has attacked his record on guns Kander, a former Army captain, says ""In the Army, I learned how to use and respect my rifle."" He continues to say, ""In the state legislature, I supported Second Amendment rights,"" while supporting background checks to keep guns like the AR-15 ""out of the hands of terrorists."" Kander was a Missouri state representative for four years, from 2009 to 2012, before he was elected secretary of state. We wanted to know more about how Kander handled Second Amendment issues as a representative, so we decided to investigate his claim. Voting record We asked Kander’s campaign about his statement, and his staff sent us part of his voting record. In 2011, Kander voted in favor of a bill that would lower the age — from 23 to 21— at which a person could get a permit to conceal and carry a gun. Kander voted against the bill when the House first debated it, but switched for the final vote. The bill became law. In 2012, he voted to lower the conceal-and-carry age from 21 to 18 for military members. That bill also became law. That same year, Kander voted for a resolution that would amend the Missouri Constitution to protect ""the right of every citizen to possess, purchase, reload, or manufacture ammunition and any other parts or articles essential to the proper functioning of arms."" The resolution died in a Senate committee. But that’s only part of the story when it comes to Kander and gun legislation. The National Rifle Association Political Victory Fund gave Kander an ‘F’ rating on his advocacy for the Second Amendment for 2016. It provided us with more information about Kander’s voting record. In 2009, Kander voted against a bill that would extend the Castle Doctrine to renters. The doctrine allows a homeowner to use deadly force against a perceived intruder. The bill also would have lowered the age to get a concealed carry permit and would remove a ban on carrying a gun on a college campus. Kander voted against the ""Business Premises Safety Act"" four times – once during each of his terms as a state representative. That bill would have prevented business owners from restricting people from lawfully possessing a firearm in a car on business property. Both the NRA and incumbent Sen. Roy Blunt, Kander’s opponent, have released ads in response to Kander’s ad, denouncing his claim that he supports the Second Amendment. What the Supreme Court says about the Second Amendment So Kander did not support every effort to expand access to guns while serving in the state legislature. That doesn’t mean he is against Second Amendment rights. In a 2010 landmark decision, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in McDonald v. City of Chicago that the Second Amendment prohibition against infringement on the right to ""keep and bear arms"" extends to state and local governments. But the court has also ruled in the 2008 case of District of Columbia v. Heller that some restrictions on guns are acceptable. In the Heller decision, Justice Scalia, writing for the majority of the Supreme Court, made clear that while D.C. could not ban handguns, the Second Amendment is ""not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose."" He went on to say that some restrictions, like the prohibition of guns in churches and government buildings, were not affected by the court’s decision. Carrying a concealed weapon is also subject to regulation. Kander’s votes against expanding access to guns fall within the Supreme Court’s definition of allowable regulation of the Second Amendment. He has never proposed, or voted for, a bill that would repeal the Second Amendment or flout the Supreme Court’s interpretation of the amendment, our review found. Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the University of California, Irvine School of Law and well-known constitutional law expert, said in an email that analysis of Kander’s stance on the Second Amendment depends on two questions: ""Does one believe that the Second Amendment protects a right to have guns?"" and ""Are particular regulations of guns desirable?"" ""Even if one believes in the Second Amendment right to have guns, that does not mean that every law to allow more access to guns should be regarded as a good thing,"" he said. ""Someone could believe in the Second Amendment, but still support some restrictions on guns."" Adam Winkler, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles who specializes in constitutional law, agreed. ""The Supreme Court has only said that the right protects the right to have a handgun in the home,"" he said in an email. ""So long as he did not vote to deny law-abiding people that right, then he can reasonably claim to be a supporter of the right to bear arms."" Our ruling In a TV ad, Kander said, ""In the state legislature, I supported Second Amendment rights."" As a state representative, Kander voted in favor of two bills, which are now law, that would lower the age for someone to conceal and carry a weapon. On the other hand, he also voted against several bills that would reduce regulations on guns. In short, his gun record is nuanced. Further, experts cautioned us not to draw a straight line between votes and gun legislation and support for the Second Amendment. It is possible to support the Second Amendment and favor some regulation on guns. Even though he sometimes voted against bills to expand access to guns, it is fair for Kander to say he supported the Second Amendment as a legislator. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information",Mostly True,"October 6, 2016"
"Says Rob Portman ""even voted to allow people on the terrorism watch list to buy guns.""","CORRECTION, 5:48p.m., September 29, 2016: Editor's note: A previous version of this story incorrectly described an amendment by Sen. Susan Collins. The story has been updated to reflect her as the author of that measure. Our rating on the claim did not change. A new TV ad from Democratic Senate candidate Ted Strickland features a veteran of combat in Iraq and Afghanistan who says he carried a gun ""so we wouldn’t have to worry about terrorists using them here."" But Sen. Rob Portman, Strickland’s Republican opponent, ""is blocking commonsense laws to stop terrorists and criminals from getting guns. Sen. Portman said no to background checks on all purchases,"" the ad’s soldier continues. ""He even voted to allow people on the terrorism watch list to buy guns."" That last statement caught our attention.  No, Portman did not vote to allow suspected terrorists to purchase guns. The attack obscures what really happened. The ad cites Senate voting records from June 20 and 23. First, we’ll consult the record. Votes 106 and 109 were two of four votes on gun control measures considered by the Senate after the worst terrorist attack on U.S. soil since 9/11. On June 12, Omar Mateen, a man who had twice been investigated by the FBI for suspected terrorist ties, killed 49 people and wounded 53 at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Fla.. Vote 106 asked senators to vote to end the debate, or to keep debating, an amendment by Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein which would authorize the U.S. attorney general to deny requests to sell firearms to ""known or suspected terrorists."" Portman voted ""nay,"" a vote against bringing the issue up for passage or failure. The week ahead of that vote, Portman told reporters in his weekly media conference call, ""I do believe that you should not be able to buy a weapon when you’re on the (terrorist) watch list."" Strickland’s ad doesn’t mention the other three votes taken that day, June 20, 2016, on the issue of suspected terrorists and gun sales. All four measures failed, largely along party lines. Portman voted in favor of Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley’s amendment to ""address gun violence and improve the availability of records to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System."" He also voted in favor of Republican Sen. John Cornyn’s proposal, an alternative to Feinstein’s measure to prevent watchlisted terrorists from buying guns. The main difference between the Feinstein amendment and the one proposed by Cornyn had to do with due process -- granting an avenue for an individual to appeal if they are wrongfully listed as a terror suspect and denied a gun purchase. The Republican amendment allowed authorities to detain a terrorism suspect who tries to obtain a firearm, and gave a judge 72 hours to determine whether there was enough proof to bar the gun sale. Feinstein’s amendment provided for an individual to appeal to the Justice Department if they felt they were wrongfully listed and barred from buying a gun. It did not have a three-day limit for the government to make its case. Republicans argued that Cornyn’s amendment, with a stronger check-and-balance requiring a court order, was necessary in light of well-known errors on federal no-fly and terrorist watch lists. Former Sen. Ted Kennedy is often cited as an example after he was erroneously stopped for extra airport security checks because ""T. Kennedy"" was an alias used by a terror suspect. A motion to table a tweaked version of Feinstein’s amendment, proposed by Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine -- the ""Vote 109"" referenced by Strickland’s ad -- failed on June 23 with a 46-52 vote, short of the 60 votes required to advance. Portman voted ""yea,"" or against the amendment, in line with all but eight Republicans. Our ruling Strickland’s campaign ad said of Portman, ""He even voted to allow people on the terrorism watch list to buy guns."" The ad distorts facts on many levels. People on the terrorism watch list could already buy guns before the votes in question. Portman voted along party lines on the gun control measures that came up for Senate vote on June 20 and 23. He voted against Feinstein’s amendment to enact a blanket ban on firearm purchases by terrorists or suspected terrorists. But he voted for the Republican version of the legislation, sponsored by Cornyn, that would ban a gun sale after a three-day period of judicial review to determine whether an individual was on a watch list for legitimate reasons. The vote for Cornyn’s legislation was literally a vote to stop terrorists from buying weapons — but the extra hurdles for the government were not supported by Democrats",False,"September 29, 2016"
"""In Chicago, they've had thousands of shootings, thousands since Jan. 1. Thousands of shootings.""","Lester Holt asked the major presidential candidates in their first debate how they would heal the nation’s racial divide, exacerbated by police shootings of unarmed African-Americans. Democrat Hillary Clinton called for a top-to-bottom re-examination of the criminal justice system to prevent uneven treatment of minorities under the law. Republican Donald Trump, stuck to his ""law and order"" approach, painting a bleak portrait of life for African-Americans and Hispanics ""living in hell because it’s so dangerous."" He zeroed in on Chicago, President Barack Obama’s hometown. ""In Chicago, they've had thousands of shootings, thousands since Jan. 1. Thousands of shootings,"" Trump said. Has Chicago had thousands of shootings so far this year? Trump’s campaign showed us an article published on Forbes Sept. 8 that says of Chicago, ""In 2015, 2,988 people were shot and 2016′s figure already stands at 2,949."" The Chicago Tribune, which tracks neighborhood crimes through its Crime in Chicagoland project, has data supporting that shooting count for 2015. And as far as this year goes? From Jan. 1 to Sept. 26, there have been 3,210 shooting victims, according to the Chicago Tribune. The publication says the data it compiles is not the same as what the city offers, so numbers will not match those tracked by the city. ""One shooting incident may have multiple victims, but it still counts officially as only one shooting,"" the Chicago Tribune site says. Even then, data released by the Chicago Police Department also shows there have been 2,521 shooting incidents in the city up to Sept. 18. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel delivered a speech Sept. 22 addressing high levels of crime in his city and ways to combat it, outlining a need for more policing, more jobs and crime prevention. ""Gun violence in Chicago is unacceptable. ... It is pulling us apart at the very moment that our city needs us to come together,"" Emanuel said, according to the Tribune. ""For all the things that make Chicago great, for all the things that make us proud to call ourselves Chicagoans, the violence that is happening corrodes our core. It is not the Chicago we know, and it is not the Chicago we love."" While the number of shooting victims so far this year have surpassed 2015, it’s important to note that they do not represent homicides, experts told us. (However, the Tribune’s count of 550 homicides so far in 2016 also outnumbers the 2015 tally of 492 homicides.) ""The word ‘shooting’ does not distinguish based on severity of the wound or the type of crime,"" said Adam Lankford, a criminology professor at the University of Alabama. Shooting statistics also include people who shot themselves by mistake. A shooting is simply a gun being fired, not someone being shot or killed, said Dewey Cornell, director of the Virginia Youth Violence Project at the University of Virginia. The city’s numbers are striking, but Cornell said violent crime in Chicago is much lower than it was 20 years ago, mirroring the national trend. When you have a flare-up in gang warfare in any community, there will be large increases in gun homicides, and Chicago has for more than a century had a gang problem that is much greater than other cities like New York, Cornell said. ""There has been an increase in gun violence in Chicago in recent years, but Chicago does not represent the U.S. and is atypical of other large cities, so it does not make sense to use Chicago as an example to understand crime in the U.S.,"" Cornell added. A plausible explanation for the rise in shootings in Chicago is that gangs have been displaced from their former turf by the demolition of some housing projects, said George A. Mocsary, an assistant professor at Southern Illinois University School of Law. ""Violence has ensued as the displaced gang members try to move into new territory claimed by other gangs,"" Mocsary said. Our ruling Trump said, ""In Chicago, they've had thousands of shootings, thousands since January 1st. Thousands of shootings."" There have been more than 3,000 shooting victims in Chicago so far this year, according to media reports and gun violence experts. The count of shootings includes all types of shootings, including shootings of more than one person and on accident, and it should not be taken as a substitute for ""homicides",True,"September 27, 2016"
"""The gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young African-American men, more than the next nine causes put together.""","During the first presidential debate at Hofstra University, Hillary Clinton decried gun violence, especially as it impacts young African-Americans. ""The gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young African-American men, more than the next nine causes put together,"" she said. This is a claim Clinton has made before, and it’s accurate. We found the relevant data on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website. Using this search form, we collected data on the 10 most common causes of death for African-American men and boys between the ages of 15 and 24, for 2014:  There were 2,256 gun-related homicides in 2014, compared to 2,119 deaths in the next nine categories combined. This makes Clinton’s statement correct. If you add in the accidents and suicides related to guns, the gap between gun-related deaths and other types of deaths expands even further. There were 2,533 gun-related deaths in all 10 categories combined, compared to 2,002 deaths in the top 10 categories that had nothing to do with guns. We should note that this statement is dependent on the age range chosen. For instance, the statement is not correct for African-American boys between age 10 and 14. There were 38 gun-related homicides in that age and racial group in 2014, plus 10 gun suicides and three unintentional injuries caused by guns, for a total of 51. By contrast, the top 10 causes of death for that age and racial group included 271 deaths that had nothing to do with guns, such as diseases. That said, we think using the definition of ""young"" as 15-24 is a reasonable one. Our ruling Clinton said, ""The gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young African-American men, more than the next nine causes put together."" As long as you define ""young"" as being between the ages of 15 and 24, Clinton’s statement is accurate, according to CDC data",True,"September 26, 2016"
"Says Marco Rubio voted ""against every bill that would have helped keep our families safe. He even voted against a bipartisan measure, introduced by a Republican, to prevent people on the no-fly list from purchasing guns.""","When U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio unveiled a gun safety bill Sept. 15, his Democratic rival for re-election attacked him for failing to support important gun safety legislation months earlier. ""After the tragedy in Orlando, Rubio used the deaths of 49 innocent Floridians to run for re-election while voting against every bill that would have helped keep our families safe,"" U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy said in a campaign statement. ""He even voted against a bipartisan measure, introduced by a Republican, to prevent people on the no-fly list from purchasing guns."" Rubio, a Republican, has been endorsed by the National Rifle Association. Murphy has been endorsed by the Pride Fund to end Gun Violence, an LGBT group formed after the June 12 Orlando mass shooting at Pulse, a gay nightclub. Rubio voted for and against gun bills following the shooting, including those related to the no-fly list, a subset of the terrorist watch list. One vote was a procedural move against a Republican-sponsored compromise effort that failed. Gun safety bills in the Senate On June 20, the Senate voted on four amendments aimed to strengthen background checks and make it harder for terrorists or suspected terrorists to buy guns. All four were rejected largely on party lines. Rubio voted against the legislation written by Democrats — a background check amendment by Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy and an amendment by California Sen. Dianne Feinstein to ban known or suspected terrorists from buying a gun. He voted in favor of the Republican versions: a background check amendment by Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley and an amendment about the terrorism watch list by Texas Sen. John Cornyn. Unlike Feinstein’s bill, which would have placed a blanket ban on gun purchases by people who are terrorists or suspected terrorists, Cornyn’s measure would have placed a three-day hold on such sales, allowing the government to make a case in court against the sale showing the person is involved in terrorism or will commit terrorism. Rubio said he supported Cornyn’s legislation because it would ensure ""Second Amendment rights are not denied unless terrorism suspicions are adjudicated by a court, following actual notice and a hearing."" Murphy's campaign  argues that Cornyn's bill requiring the federal government to show probable cause in court sets an unworkable standard of proof for law enforcement in court.  (Under current law, being on a government terrorist watch list is not an automatic reason to be denied the right to buy a gun; however, the FBI is notified. There have to be other disqualifying factors, such as a felony conviction or being an undocumented immigrant.) These were not the bills Murphy was talking about. Murphy was referring to a compromise crafted by Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine. Collins’ amendment proposed to ban people from buying guns if they were on the no-fly list or the ""selectee list,"" which means they undergo additional screening before boarding a plane. Those who were banned from buying guns could appeal in court. The amendment had 12 cosponsors: seven Democrats, four Republicans and one independent. On June 23, a motion to table the legislation failed with a 46-52 vote. That left the amendment still pending, but it showed that her legislation was short of the 60 votes required to advance — and it never did. The question was a motion to table, so when Rubio voted ""yea"" he was voting against the amendment. Eight Republicans voted against tabling the legislation. Rubio cosponsored another Republican alternative from Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin. That proposal would have also blocked those on a terrorist list from buying guns but delayed the sale for three days with the possibility of an extension to allow for an investigation. Then it required a hearing before a judge to block the person from buying a gun. It failed 67-31. A day before the vote on the Collins amendment, Rubio told reporters that it was a ""difficult balancing act"" to bar terrorists from getting guns while protecting constitutional rights. ""They’re trying to do it all in a hurry here, and I think we need to get it right,"" he said. After the vote, Rubio told CNN that he was concerned about how much money a gun buyer would have to spend on an appeal. ""If you erroneously end up on a no-fly list, or a selectee list, unless you can come up with $10,000 or $15,000 to hire a lawyer, even if you get your fees back upfront, it’s going to be hard and intimidating to go to a federal court,"" he said. On Sept. 15, Rubio unveiled his own bill that would allow the U.S. attorney general to delay a firearms' purchase for up to three days and file an emergency court petition if someone previously investigated for terrorism tried to buy a gun. The Orlando shooter, Omar Mateen, had previously been placed on a terrorist watch list in 2013 and was investigated by the FBI but he was never charged and later removed from the list. After the gun legislation in the Senate died in June, the House didn’t take the bills up for a vote. Murphy cosponsored a bill requiring the FBI be notified when individuals under a terrorism investigation and those formerly under investigation purchase firearms or explosives. U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., introduced a similar version in the Senate, but neither bill has reached a vote. Was Collins’ amendment bipartisan? Murphy called Collins’ amendment bipartisan, and in many ways it seems as though it was: It was written by a Republican, drew four Republican cosponsors along with seven Democrats, and attracted eight GOP members’ support in the procedural vote against tabling it. The U.S. Senate has 54 Republicans and 45 Democrats (including one independent, Bernie Sanders, who pursued the Democratic presidential nomination). There is no pure definition of what can be called a ""bipartisan"" piece of legislation but you know it when you see it, said David Hawkings, senior editor of CQ Roll Call, a publication that tracks votes and legislation. ""It’s an evolving definition -- as Congress gets more and more polarized on party lines even a handful crossing going against the grain makes it bipartisan,"" he said. ""It’s situational."" Hawkings said he would consider Collins’ amendment bipartisan. ""In that case it was an effort by Collins, obviously a Republican, who was trying to put together enough Republicans to go against the wishes of their own leadership and go with Democrats to advance this,"" he said. Laurel Harbridge, a political scientist at Northwestern University who recently wrote a book about bipartisanship, says that a bill is ""bipartisan"" if at least 20 percent of a bill's cosponsors hail from the opposite party as the sponsor. So Collins’ amendment would meet that definition. ""In today's polarized Congress any measure that picks up any support from the other side of the aisle might be deemed bipartisan -- especially on a particularly salient and charged issue like gun control,"" George Washington University political scientist Sarah Binder said. Our ruling Murphy said Rubio voted ""against every bill that would have helped keep our families safe. He even voted against a bipartisan measure, introduced by a Republican, to prevent people on the no-fly list from purchasing guns."" Murphy overstates the situation when he says Rubio voted against ""every"" bill that came up after the Orlando massacre. Rubio voted for Republican-sponsored legislation about background checks and adding restrictions to individuals on the terrorist list.  Murphy has a point that Rubio voted against a Republican-sponsored, bipartisan measure to ban people on the no-fly list from buying weapons. However, this ad omits that Rubio supported a separate Republican measure that also banned people on the no-fly list from buying guns but required a court hearing before the person was banned from buying a gun.

Says eight Americans died in a knife attack at a Minnesota mall.,"In a fundraising email for a ""Secure Our Borders Gun Giveaway,"" former Colorado Rep. Tom Tancredo's PAC incorrectly said eight people died in a knife attack at a Minnesota. Tancredo, a Republican who represented the 6th Congressional District from 1999 to 2009, is known for his hard-line crusade against illegal immigration and provocative comments. Fortunately, none of the 10 people who were injured died in the Sept. 17 attack at the Crossroads Center mall in St. Cloud. All the victims -- including seven men, one woman and a 15-year-old girl -- have been released from the hospital, the Associated Press reported.     The only person who was killed was the suspected attacker, a young Somali man dressed as a private security guard, who was shot by an off-duty police officer. A Sept. 19 fundraising email promoting Team America PAC's gun giveaway quoted Tancredo, the group's founder and president, saying: ""I mentioned that we live in dangerous times -- and the events of this week only remind us of that fact once more."" ""The threat of radical Islam is higher than ever as the nation mourns the death of eight Americans at the hands of a Somalian refugee in Minnesota,"" the email inaccurately stated.   ""With these continued threats it's important that we do everything in our power to defend ourselves and our families,"" Tancredo said. ""….I can think of no better way to defend yourself and your family than with an H&K P2000, the same gun used by Border Patrol agents."" The email linked to a Team America PAC website where people could enter the ""Gun Giveaway"" sweepstakes for the .40-caliber Heckler & Koch handgun. A Tancredo statement on the contest page said it's being held to ""To encourage Americans to elect candidates for office who will work to secure our border."" ""After you sign up for the giveaway, please consider making a donation of $100, $50, $25 or even $10,"" Tacredo said. ""We can only continue the fight to secure our borders with your help!"" When PolitiFact partner Denver7 notified Tancredo of the factual error in its fundraising email, he said he was aware of the error and issued this correction to PolitiFact and Denver7: ""My email earlier this morning inaccurately portrayed that the attacks in Minnesota led to innocent deaths and not simply the death of the perpetrator. ""Despite that error, the email was correct in stating that these truly are troubling times, a fact furthered by the shootout and arrest of the Afghani bombing suspect in New Jersey just moments ago. ""Please read the email below for more information regarding how you can protect yourself and your family in the face of these attacks by entering Team America PAC's gun giveaway. I apologize for any confusion with the last email."" In an interview, Tancredo told PolitiFact the PAC's two-man staff had made ""apologies all the way around"" for the error.

"Under the current procedure, if someone ""on a terror watch list"" tries to buy a gun, authorities are notified.","A week after Omar Mateen gunned down 49 people and injured more than 50 others at a gay nightclub in Orlando in June, U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, appeared on NBC’s ""Meet the Press."" Days earlier, the FBI disclosed that Mateen had previously been under investigation and was, for a time, on a terrorist watch list. Ryan was asked about legislation intended to delay or prevent people on those lists from obtaining guns. ""The question right now,"" Ryan said, ""is if someone is on a terror watch list, are the authorities notified as to whether a person on that list is trying to purchase a gun or not? That is the procedure right now."" Is Ryan right that under the current procedure, if someone ""on a terror watch list"" tries to buy a gun, authorities are notified? How gun screening works When we asked Ryan’s office to provide backup for his claim, a spokesman pointed to a 2010 U.S. Government Accountability Office report. That report states the FBI is alerted when a federal background check for a gun transfer is performed on someone whose name is on a terrorist watch list. We confirmed the same with Dave Joly, a spokesman for the FBI’s Terrorist Screening Center, and Second Amendment expert Adam Winkler, a law professor at the UCLA School of Law. Such background checks are mandated under a federal law called the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act — commonly known as the ""Brady Bill."" States can choose to conduct the background checks themselves, or have the FBI perform them. Either way, a background check involves verifying the buyer’s identity and searching for information in databases that would determine if the gun purchase is illegal. For instance, someone who is under indictment, has a felony conviction, uses illicit drugs or is an illegal immigrant is not permitted to buy a gun. Background checks typically result in approving the gun purchase, denying it or imposing a three-day delay to allow for further investigation. While conducting such checks, the federal government can screen for people whose names appear on terrorist watch lists — though the fact someone is on such a list does not alone disqualify that person from buying a gun under the Brady Bill. Indeed, the vast majority of people on terror watch lists have been allowed to purchase guns. The federal government began cross-referencing gun background checks with terrorist watch lists in 2004, and through 2015, there were 2,477 instances when someone on a terrorist watch list was involved in a gun background check. About 91 percent of those transactions were permitted, according to the Government Accountability Office. If federal authorities are notified someone on a terrorist watch list is trying to buy a gun, they can take steps to thwart the purchase. For instance, investigators can review paperwork the prospective gun buyer completed to check for other new, potentially disqualifying information. Private sales excluded Importantly, the Brady Bill does not require background checks for all gun transfers: It applies only to gun sales by federally licensed firearm dealers. Unlicensed sellers are not required to document or report sales under the law. At least 18 states and the District of Columbia have enacted laws that go beyond the Brady Bill and require background checks in some private gun sales, according to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, a nonprofit organization that tracks firearm laws and litigation in the United States and seeks to reduce gun violence. But the other states — including Wisconsin — have no such requirement. There is no definitive figure of how many private gun sales occur, although experts have made some informed estimates. A National Institute of Justice study estimated there were 13.7 million gun transfers between 1993 and 1994 in the United States; roughly 60 percent involved licensed dealers, while about 40 percent were ""off-the-books transfers"" through unlicensed sellers. Preliminary data from a more recent, yet-to-be-published survey suggests the proportion of unlicensed gun sales has decreased, but such sales still involve millions of guns each year, according to Northeastern University Professor Matthew Miller, who co-directs the Harvard Injury Control Research Center. Our rating Ryan said that under the current procedure, if someone ""on a terror watch list"" tries to buy a gun, authorities are notified. That is accurate as it applies to gun sales in which a federal background check occurs. But a significant amount of gun sales or other transfers lack background checks, so there would be no red flag when someone on the list tries to buy a gun",Half True,"September 2, 2016"
"Says Alex Jones ""said that the victims of the Sandy Hook massacre were child actors and no one was actually killed there.""","Suggesting connections between right-wing hate groups and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton brought up talk-show host Alex Jones, a Texas-based pro-Trump conspiracy theorist who runs InfoWars.com. Jones, Clinton declared Aug. 25, 2016, ""even said, and this really just is so disgusting, he even said the victims of the Sandy Hook massacre were child actors and no one was actually killed there. I don’t know what happens in somebody’s mind or how dark their heart must be to say things like that."" The same day, Jones disputed Clinton’s statement, telling viewers of his Austin-based program that Clinton ""lied, not only to the U.S. but the world... that I say that no children died at Sandy Hook and they were all actors. I’ve never said any of those things."" A moment later, Jones went on: ""They can’t find anywhere where I have said that I know the kids killed at Sandy Hook were actors or that it didn’t happen"" and furthermore, he said, he’s been criticized by conspiracy theorists who maintain the Sandy Hook events were fake--""because I don’t buy into that."" We were curious who was right, so we put Clinton’s statement to the Texas Truth-O-Meter. First, this background: 20 children and six adults died at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, Dec. 14, 2012, at the hands of gun-carrying Adam Lanza, 20. Lanza had killed his mother at home before the school shooting, and then killed himself at the school as officers closed in. After her speech, Clinton’s campaign offered as backup to its claim about Jones and Sandy Hook part of its background paper quoting a June 23, 2016, story in the New Yorker magazine. The story said Jones incidentally had Trump on his program hours before the San Bernardino, Calif., shootings and Jones then ""praised Trump, claiming that ninety per cent of his listeners were Trump supporters, and Trump had returned the favor, saying, ‘Your reputation is amazing. I will not let you down,’"" the story said, going on to say Jones had historically insisted various national tragedies were inside jobs and, reporter William Finnegan wrote, ""Jones believes that no one was actually hurt at Sandy Hook — those were actors."" An embedded link in the story points to a video snippet likely excerpted, we determined, from the second hour of Jones’ Jan. 13, 2015 show in which Jones was asked by a caller if he thinks that after Sandy Hook, there’s a ""new level of sophistication"" to authorities planting ""flimsy evidence"" on sites that ""get everybody talking, going in the wrong direction"" after incidents. Jones replied: ""Yeah, when you’re trying to decipher cloak and dagger dirty tricks, it’s pretty hard to do. It’s just that then you learn that they were funded by western funding. Then you learn that it was the same (inaudible) connection, underwear bomber. Then those are big red flags that they were patsy provocateurs. The classic MO has been followed. ""And then yeah, it kind of becomes a red herring to say the whole thing was staged--because they have staged events before. But then you learn the school had been closed and reopened, and you’ve got video of the kids going in circles in and out of the building, and they don’t call the rescue choppers for two hours, then they tear the building down and seal it, and they get caught using blue screens and a email by Bloomberg comes out in a lawsuit where he’s telling his people to get ready in the next 24 hours to capitalize on a shooting. ""Yeah, so, Sandy Hook is a synthetic completely fake with actors, in my view, manufactured. I couldn’t believe it at first. I knew they had actors there, clearly, but I thought they killed some real kids. And it just shows how bold they are, that they clearly used actors. I mean they even ended up using photos of kids killed in mass shootings here in a fake mass shooting in Turkey -- so yeah, or Pakistan. The sky is now the limit. I appreciate your call."" Also, a web link below the video excerpt led us to check on Jones’ Dec. 28, 2014, episode in which the host, responding to a caller, called the Sandy Hook incident ""a giant hoax."" Jones elaborated: ""The general public doesn’t know the school was actually closed the year before."" Also: ""They don’t know they had kids going in and out of the building as a photo opp."" And, Jones said on that show: ""But it took me about a year with Sandy Hook to come to grips with the fact that the whole thing was fake. I mean, I couldn’t  believe it. I knew they jumped on it, used the crisis, hyped it up. But then I did deep research--and my gosh, it just pretty much didn’t happen."" We found a little more Jones’ commentary. In a Sept. 24, 2014, episode of the show, Jones cited a story on the InfoWars webpage that day headlined, ""FBI says no one killed at Sandy Hook."" Jones then said, ""According to FBI crime statistics at FBI.gov, no one died in 2012 in Sandy Hook. It shows no homicides in that town."" By email, we tried to ask InfoWars staff about Jones’ comments and didn’t hear back. Our ruling Clinton said Jones ""said that the victims of the Sandy Hook massacre were child actors and no one was actually killed there."" Clinton didn’t nail Jones’ wording. But the Austin broadcaster said quite clearly long before Clinton spoke that the day’s tragic events featured actors and also ""pretty much didn’t happen",True,"September 1, 2016"
"Says there are ""concrete examples"" of University of Texas job applicants or prospective applicants and students as well as invited speakers changing their minds because of handguns being allowed in campus buildings and classrooms.","A University of Texas English professor says a law enabling Texans with state permits to carry concealed guns into classrooms has already caused prospective faculty, students and even speakers not to come to the Austin campus. Lisa Moore said in an NPR interview aired Aug. 7, 2016, six days after the campus-carry mandate took effect: ""We already have concrete examples of faculty who have declined to apply for jobs here at the university or who, once offered jobs, have turned them down when they realized that this policy would go into effect, students changing their minds about coming to our graduate and undergraduate programs, and invited speakers declining to come when they realized that we couldn't guarantee that they would give their talk in a gun-free space."" ""Concrete examples"" is definitive. So, how about details? First it’s worth noting that since 1995, Texas law has allowed any individual with a concealed handgun permit to carry a gun on public college and university sidewalks, streets, parking areas and other grounds. In 2015, state lawmakers widened the law by voting to let permit holders also carry guns in campus buildings, except in areas excluded under rules adopted by each school’s president. UT-Austin President Gregory L. Fenves has written that he doesn’t believe handguns belong in campus buildings; still, he agreed to allow them in classrooms because, he said, barring them would have the effect of generally excluding guns from campus, which the law prohibits. In February 2016, Fenves also wrote Bill McRaven, the UT System chancellor: ""Since this is a new law with an unknown effect on UT Austin, we will monitor implementation and its impact on students, faculty members, and staffers. I have significant concerns about how the law will affect our ability to recruit and retain faculty members and students. Fenves is among state defendants, too, in a lawsuit filed by Moore and two fellow professors seeking to bar civilian handguns from campus. On Aug. 22, 2016, a federal judge denied their request for a preliminary injunction that would have allowed them to ban concealed handguns from their classrooms. U.S. District Judge Lee Yeakel said he found no precedent for the argument that professors have a right of academic freedom under the First Amendment so broad that it overrides decisions of the Legislature and the university that employs them. Moore, Jennifer Lynn Glass and Mia Carter were still free to pursue the merits of their case. But Yeakel’s ruling was a considerable setback for them, as they wanted to ban guns in time for the start of fall classes. Virginia professor declined UT visit Moore, asked for concrete examples, initially responded with an email reminding that an out-of-state candidate for a UT deanship said he bowed out of consideration in 2015 due to the gun law. A February 2016 Austin American-Statesman news blog post quoted Siva Vaidhyanathan, a University of Virginia professor of media studies who’d previously earned UT bachelor’s and doctoral degrees, saying he’d been contacted by a search firm helping the university find a dean for the Moody College of Communication--and, the story said, was later told he was a finalist. But the gun law weighed on him; the story said that if chosen, Vaidhyanathan said, he’d have felt compelled to side with faculty members seeking to bar guns from classrooms. ""I would probably be fired immediately,"" he said. ""I told the search firm I was no longer interested in the position."" To our inquiry, Vaidhyanathan provided a December 2015 email he sent to search firm officials declining their invitation to return to the Texas campus for ""an extended visit and a dinner"" about the deanship that would have included meetings with Fenves and others. Vaidhyanathan’s email said the prospect of guns being allowed in classrooms meant he couldn’t ""pursue this position with enthusiasm."" Vaidhyanathan wrote: ""I could not, in good conscience, ask faculty and students to put themselves into an environment in which students, visitors, or even faculty could be armed. My wife is a scientist. I could not ask her to take a job at a university that was forbidden by law to restrict guns from classrooms. The very consideration of that possibility puts a chilling effect on open and relaxed discourse in the classroom. And the fact that the university cannot restrict guns on campus in general means that university police officers are forbidden to do their jobs effectively. They can’t diffuse a threatening situation until it becomes a dangerous one. ""Universities are tense enough already. And we all count on our university police forces to confront and (defuse) threatening situations as early as possible. The State of Texas has put every student and professor in Texas in danger. I applaud the chancellor, the president, the faculty, and the students for their strong opposition to campus carry."" So, that’s a candidate for dean confirmed. Next, we followed up with Moore about particular students, other prospective faculty and speakers deciding not to come to UT due to the gun law. A mother’s email Moore forwarded a November 2015 email sent by a parent, Rachel Zucker, to a UT mailbox. The message says: ""Dear UT, I want you to know that my son, Moses Goren, is a straight A student at Hunter College High School (in NYC) who has expressed interest in applying to your Plan II program at UT (Austin). He and I have decided, however, that he will not apply to any schools that have campus carry laws. We believe that guns should not be allowed on college campuses and that guns present a serious physical danger for faculty and students. If you were to make UT Austin a safer place by making it illegal to bring a gun on campus, I would eagerly and proudly have Moses apply to your esteemed school. Thank you, Rachel Zucker"" To our inquiry, Zucker confirmed her son’s decision. ""Both of us feel even clearer about this than we did when wrote that email. The rampant gun violence and lack of commonsense gun control in this country should be a source of unmitigated shame for our leaders and legislators,"" Zucker said by email, adding that she hopes UT bans guns on campus. Moore also noted the departures of two UT faculty members by 2016. In each instance -- Architecture Dean Frederick Steiner’s move to the University of Pennsylvania and economist Daniel Hamermesh’s shift to opportunities abroad -- news stories and emails we fielded from the men describe the gun law as a factor, though not the only factor, in the departures. Hamermesh urged us to consult Joan Neuberger, a UT history professor, who responded by emailing a prospective graduate student’s February 2016 email saying she would decline UT’s offer of admission ""due to my misgivings with the campus carry guidelines President Fenves released today."" Nora Dolliver went on: ""Although I think that UT would be a wonderful place to complete my graduate training, I am unwilling to study or work in an environment where my classmates, professors, students, or patrons are permitted to carry handguns."" Harvard professor’s decision A March 2016 news story in UT’s student newspaper, The Daily Texan, quoted Moore saying a Harvard University professor had withdrawn from a search for a faculty position in the UT Women and Gender Studies department because of the measure letting guns into classrooms. By phone, Moore told us the professor, Robin Bernstein, had been urged by Moore and others to apply in 2015, but Bernstein, citing the gun law, declared she wouldn’t. ""She definitely would have been a finalist,"" Moore said, adding that faculty were ultimately unable to fill the position. By email, Bernstein told us she was invited to apply for a professorship in women’s and gender studies but declined to do so ""in large part because of the changes in Texas law to allow guns in class."" Bernstein shared a portion of her November 2015 email to Moore about deciding not to apply. The email says Bernstein had been ""watching the madness with the Texas legislature"" and wasn’t more than 50 percent sure she’d accept the UT job if it were offered. Concerned outside speaker Moore, asked about speakers deciding not coming to campus, pointed us to Paloma Diaz, an administrator in UT’s Teresa Lozano Long Institute for Latin American Studies. Diaz said by phone that a speaker who teaches at the University of Washington cited the gun law in initially resisting the institute’s invitation to give a talk in fall 2016, though she said the speaker subsequently relented. Diaz said she didn’t have permission to identify the speaker. Otherwise, a web search showed the institute has posted a notice that Angelina Snodgrass Godoy, a UW professor, is expected to visit and give talks Sept. 26, 2016. Godoy didn't respond to our query. We couldn’t fairly consider a couple of late-breaking instances of invited speakers deciding not to come to UT because their decisions became public after Moore spoke to NPR. Still: --A Duke University professor, Karla Holloway, wrote Phillip Barrish, a UT English professor, that she was rescinding her acceptance of Barrish’s invitation to speak on the campus in fall 2016. Holloway wrote Aug. 26, 2016: ""I believe guns, and especially the vulnerabilities exposed in conceal carry cultures, contribute mightily to our nation’s public health crisis. And with the conceal carry now in full effect there, and after discussion with my family, I just cannot come."" To our inquiry, Holloway forwarded a copy of the emailed March 2016 invitation from Barrish that she and Barrish told us she’d previously accepted. --Neuberger separately alerted us to a Texas Christian University historian, Hanan Hammad, reversing course about speaking at UT, also while citing the gun law (which allows private universities like TCU to opt out of the mandate). To our inquiry, Hammad forwarded her Aug. 26, 2016, email rescinding her agreement to speak in October 2016. Hammad wrote that ""with campus carry now in full effect at UT, I just cannot come. I'm always proud to be a UT alumnus and I owe my mentors and teachers great deal, but I'm in full solidarity with all UT faculty, staff, and students whose health and lives are in danger due to campus carry. I believe open or conceal carry on campus is wrong and dangerous."" UT administration suggests claim solid We also asked a university spokesman, Gary Susswein, about the accuracy of Moore’s claim. Susswein responded by emailing a web link to an August 2016 statement by sociologist Harry Edwards, a professor emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley, in which Edwards said that due to implementation of the gun law, he was rescinding his permission to present UT lectures on sport and society, launched in 2014, in his name. ""My decision was an exceedingly difficult one,"" Edwards wrote, ""but silence is evil's greatest and most consistently dependable ally."" Another campus spokesman, J.B. Bird, said by email the administration could confirm Moore’s claim. Bird didn’t identify resistant individuals by name though he wrote that the university provost’s office ""confirmed hearing of a few people who decided not to interview and who stated that it was because of campus carry. Similarly, Bird said, provost officials say ""they have heard of a few cases of faculty speakers who have decided not to come to campus to give talks because of the law."" Bird said too that ""we know of students changing their minds about coming based on campus carry. Our admissions office said when the law was announced they received about 10 calls and 10-15 emails with applicants saying that they were not coming or would not apply. We assume that we don’t hear from 100 percent of the people who make this decision. ""That said,"" Bird wrote, ""we did just admit the largest incoming freshmen class in UT’s history, with about 8,500 freshman. From what we have seen, though, the assertion is true that some individuals have chosen not to come because of the new state law."" Our ruling Moore told NPR there are ""concrete examples"" of UT job applicants, prospective students and invited speakers deciding not to come to the university because of conceal-carry permit holders newly being allowed to bring handguns into campus buildings including classrooms. Not naming names, UT’s administration says this is so. We separately identified two out-of-state professors, a prospective graduate student and the mother of a high school student who cited the change in gun law and policy for not continuing to seek a UT position or not applying to come there--plus an outside speaker who reportedly resisted an invitation to speak on campus before relenting",True,"August 26, 2016"
"Milwaukee police use deadly force at a rate that is ""among the lowest"" in the country.","The day after a sniper killed five Dallas police officers, Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn held a news conference to share his reaction and to comment on policing in his city. He made an important claim that would become even more significant in the weeks to come. The chief stated: ""We stand ready to be judged by the standards of our own training, our own selection criteria, our own highly limited use of deadly force -- among the lowest rates in the country -- as well as the remarkable examples, time after time, when police officers in this city are justified in the use of deadly force, but do not use it."" Flynn made the statement on July 8, 2016. Five weeks later, on Aug. 13, one of his officers fatally shot an armed man during a foot chase in an incident that touched off two days of violence that made national news. (It was the third such fatality in Milwaukee in 2016.) So, do Milwaukee police use deadly force at a rate that is among the lowest in the country? It’s a broad statement that is supported by national data for 2015. But there simply isn’t national data to compare cities for prior years. Data is limited To back the chief’s statement, a Milwaukee police spokesman directed us to a fatal police shootings database for 2015 created by the Washington Post. Criminologists regard it as the best current source of information on fatal shootings committed by police. But since 2015 is the only full year of data available, it is a ""snapshot of one year,"" University of Missouri-St. Louis criminologist David Klinger told us. Nationwide, according to the Post, there were 990 people shot and killed by police around the country in 2015 (as well as nearly 600 so far in 2016). A quick breakdown of the 2015 figures: Eleven of the 2015 fatal shootings occurred in Wisconsin, but just one in Milwaukee. Tyrone Ryerson Lawrence, a 45-year-old black man, was shot inside a home. He refused to drop a knife and an officer shot him, fearing that Lawrence would stab his wife, according to police. There’s no question that one is a low number -- particularly for a city with a population of 600,000. The bigger picture But Flynn made a general claim about Milwaukee having a low rate in the use of deadly force, not a claim about a single year. And numbers can vary relatively significantly in a given year. In 2013, for example, Milwaukee police fatally shot four people. We found that based on population, some cities had a much lower rate than Milwaukee that year: San Francisco police killed one person, while the number was three in Austin, Texas (which serves 842,000 people), San Jose, Calif. (982,000), and Las Vegas (nearly 1.5 million). To be sure, the raw numbers haven’t ranged widely in Milwaukee -- 2012 -- 1; 2013 -- 4; 2014 -- 2; 2015 -- 1. But without national figures for anything but 2015, we don’t know how Milwaukee’s rate compares. Our rating Flynn said Milwaukee police use deadly force at a rate that is ""among the lowest"" in the country. Flynn bases his claim on the best data currently available, which show Milwaukee police killed one person in 2015. But 2015 is the only full year for which data are available on a national level; we simply don’t know how Milwaukee’s rate would compare in prior years",Half True,"August 19, 2016"
"""Toomey crossed party lines… to stop gun sales to suspects on the terror watch list.""","As Pennsylvania Republican Sen. Pat Toomey battles for re-election in one of the most important senate races in the nation, it’s been his record on guns that’s drawn some of the most attention. It’s apparently part of why former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg endorsed Toomey, and Bloomberg’s political action committee is now running ads in support of Toomey that tout his efforts to ""put our safety ahead of partisan politics."" The Independence USA PAC bankrolled an ad running in Pennsylvania that claims ""Toomey crossed party lines twice: first to support background checks, and now to stop gun sales to suspects on the terror watch list."" We’ve written before about Toomey signing on in 2013 and putting his name on a bill that would have expanded background checks. But what about his efforts to stop gun sales to suspects on the terror watch list? Toomey’s record there is a bit murkier. To be clear: A bill that would stop gun sales to suspects on any sort of terror watch list has not passed. Efforts were made after the June shooting in Orlando at Pulse Nightclub, the deadliest mass shooting in American history, which left 49 people and the shooter dead. But those efforts were fruitless. There were several major bills drafted in the wake of Orlando that would have closed what’s been called ""the terror loophole,"" or would make it harder for suspected terrorists on the federal government’s radar to buy guns. Two such bills -- both with largely partisan backing -- were brought up for a vote on June 20 and both were defeated. Proponents of a ban on gun sales to those on a terror watch list say individuals who are suspected terrorists appear on a no-fly list, but are still allowed to purchase guns. Opponents worry individuals who accidentally end up on the no-fly list would be stripped of their second amendment rights. The Democrats’ bill was a plan by Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, and her bill would have placed a blanket ban on the purchase of guns by those on the no-fly list, as it was dubbed ""no-fly, no buy."" Some Republicans argued her bill didn’t give an out to people who may have ended up on the watch list mistakenly. Two Republicans voted in favor of Feinstein’s bill. Toomey wasn’t one of them, saying the bill didn’t include enough due process for potential gun owners. The majority of Republicans supported a bill from Sen. John Cornyn, of Texas. His measure, which was backed by the National Rifle Association, would have placed a three-day hold when anyone on the terror watch list attempted to purchase a gun. Within those three days, the government would have to present a case before a court in order to stop the person from buying the firearm. Though Toomey said in June that it would be hard for law enforcement to make Cornyn’s measure ""workable,"" he voted in favor of it in the end. Toomey also drafted his own bill to close the terror loophole, which he touted as a measure that would bridge the gap between the Feinstein and the Cornyn amendments. Under Toomey’s plan, the U.S. attorney general would generate a list of ""likely terrorists"" separate from the existing no-fly list. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court would review the list, and the attorney general would have the power to block the purchase of a gun by an individual on that list. But Toomey’s bill largely flopped. Though he was reportedly in talks with gun control group Everytown for Gun Safety, the group ultimately didn’t endorse his proposal. Republican leaders didn’t put it up for a vote, and Democrats largely opposed it. When PolitiFact reached out to Toomey’s campaign to inquire about his record when it comes to closing the terror loophole, his campaign pointed out that Toomey was one of eight Republicans to support an amendment from Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, that would have given the Justice Department the ability to deny gun sales to individuals on two terror-related lists -- and it had an appeal process. That bill, which Toomey spoke on the Senate floor in favor of, had bipartisan support and survived a ""test vote"" several days after the Feinstein and Cornyn amendments failed. That showed that the bill had significant support, but not the 60 votes it would need to advance -- meaning GOP leaders probably won’t bring it up for a full vote any time soon. Independence USA, which is running the ads in Pennsylvania, didn’t respond to a request for comment. Our Ruling In an ad running in Pennsylvania, the Independence USA PAC backed by Mayor Michael Bloomberg claimed ""Toomey crossed party lines… to stop gun sales to suspects on the terror watch list."" This ad is misleading at its core, largely because a measure to stop gun sales to suspects on the terror watch list never passed. Toomey’s own bill failed to garner significant support from either side of the aisle. Though he voted for the Collins amendment which had bipartisan support, that amendment was drafted by a Republican. In the end, Toomey voted with his party when he voted against Feinstein’s bill and in favor of Cornyn’s",Mostly False,"August 15, 2016"
"Hillary Clinton ""has already said she's going to wipe out the Second Amendment. She doesn't believe in the First Amendment. And, she also believes in big government, which flies in the face of the 10th Amendment""","Khizr Khan, the father of a Muslim-American soldier who was killed in the Iraq War, accused Donald Trump of not reading the Constitution. Rep. Chris Collins, a Trump supporter, turned the claim around on Hillary Clinton. During an interview on MSNBC, Collins made assertions about Clinton’s views on the Constitution in the context of the Gold Star father’s Democratic National Convention speech. ""He stood next to Hillary Clinton, who has already said she's going to wipe out the Second Amendment. She doesn't believe in the First Amendment. And, she also believes in big government, which flies in the face of the 10th Amendment."" Collins said during the interview. ""That was absolutely hypocritical."" Collins based his claims on a few of Clinton’s positions. She has criticized the U.S. Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision that deemed spending money to influence elections ""free speech"" that may not be limited. She supports gun control. Collins said he also believes Clinton will continue to issue executive orders similar to those by President Obama. His office says that practice violates the 10th Amendment. Is Collins right about Clinton’s positions on the First, Second, and 10th Amendments? The First Amendment Hillary Clinton does not agree with the Supreme Court’s 2010 decision in Citizens United v. Federal Elections Commission. The Supreme Court held in the case that restrictions could not be placed on how corporations spend money to influence an election. In the opinion of the court, since corporations have the same rights as individuals, they are also guaranteed free speech under the First Amendment. That does not mean Clinton does not believe in the First Amendment. It means she, like many others, does not agree with the court’s interpretation of the First Amendment in this case. The Second Amendment The Supreme Court has ruled the Second Amendment guarantees the right of citizens to bear arms. Clinton supports gun control policies that gun-rights advocates call contrary to its interpretation. Clinton said in her speech to the Democratic National Convention that she was ""not here to repeal the Second Amendment."" In an interview on ABC's 'This Week,' Clinton said, ""I believe we can have common-sense gun safety measures consistent with the Second Amendment."" PolitiFact earlier this year rated as False Trump’s claim that Clinton ""wants to abolish the 2nd Amendment. The 10th Amendment Republicans have criticized President Barack Obama’s use of executive orders to address issues Congress has not acted on. Clinton’s campaign has said in the past she would consider using that power, too,  if she cannot reach agreements with Congress. Collins calls that a slippery slope to violating the Constitution. The 10th Amendment reinforces the idea of federalism. Some laws are decided at the state level while others are under federal control. We spoke to constitutional law experts Laurence Tribe from Harvard Law School and Matthew Steilen from the University at Buffalo about Collins' claim. In this case, they said executive actions and orders typically do not directly contradict the 10th Amendment. The argument stems partly from Obama’s actions on gun control earlier this year and immigration in 2014.  Executive actions are not new. George Washington even issued them. Obama has issued more than many presidents, but fewer than others. Ronald Reagan issued 381, while Obama issued 244 through July. Our ruling In an interview on MSNBC, Collins said Clinton is ""going to wipe out the Second Amendment. She doesn't believe in the First Amendment. And, she also believes in big government, which flies in the face of the 10th Amendment.""

"Says Hillary Clinton ""doesn’t believe in your right to keep a gun at home for self-defense.""","In a new multi-million-dollar ad buy, the NRA attacks Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s stance on guns. Clinton, the ad says, doesn’t want gun owners to be able to protect themselves. The National Rifle Association said it’s spending $3 million on the ad in North Carolina plus other ""key battleground states"" of Pennsylvania, Ohio and Nevada. ""She’s one of the wealthiest women in politics,"" the ad begins. ""Combined income: $30 million. Tours the world on private jets. Protected by armed guards for 30 years. But she doesn’t believe in your right to keep a gun at home for self-defense."" Not even counting its TV exposure, the ad had been watched more than 100,000 times online within a day of being uploaded. We’re interested in the crux of the ad, which claims Clinton ""doesn’t believe in your right to keep a gun at home for self-defense."" Her Republican rival, Donald Trump, has made similar claims before. He got a False for saying Clinton wants to abolish the Second Amendment in May and again in July. PolitiFact has also given a Pants on Fire ruling to a viral image that spread online during the primary, saying Clinton said she wants to shut down the NRA and ban handguns. Now the NRA has also entered the fray, launching its ad campaign the day after Trump said that ""Second Amendment people"" might be able to somehow stop Clinton. Clinton’s communications manager for North Carolina, Andrew Bates, said the ad contains ""lies"" about Clinton because she supports gun control measures the NRA doesn’t like. Clinton’s past statements Clinton has had a fairly consistent view on gun rights: She says she respects the Second Amendment but thinks more regulations are OK to try to curb gun violence. Her website has details of her specific proposals, and she has also made a number of public statements. In August 2015, after a news crew in Virginia was murdered on-camera, Clinton said, ""We've got to do something. It's a very difficult political issue. But we are smart enough, compassionate enough to balance legitimate Second Amendment rights concerns with preventive measures and control measures."" When Clinton was running for president in 2008, she said virtually the same thing in a debate and argued for reinstating a ban on assault weapons that expired under George W. Bush. Her husband, Bill Clinton, signed the ban into law with support from former presidents Ronald Reagan, Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford. ""You know, I believe in the Second Amendment,"" Clinton said in the debate. ""People have a right to bear arms. But I also believe that we can common-sensically approach this."" Clinton has also made gun rights supporters nervous at times. She once suggested a voluntary gun buyback program, although she compared it to one in Australia – not realizing the Australian program was a mandatory confiscation, not a buyback. And in an interview with ABC News anchor (and former Bill Clinton advisor) George Stephanopoulos, she declined to say for certain that she agrees the right to bear arms applies to individuals, which the Supreme Court decided in the landmark 2008 Supreme Court case District of Columbia v. Heller. ""If it is a constitutional right, then it, like every other constitutional right, is subject to reasonable regulation,"" she said. Criticisms Jennifer Baker, the public affairs director for the NRA’s lobbying arm, said the ad is accurate because of Clinton’s stance on the Heller case. If Clinton becomes president, Baker said, she will be tasked with picking a judge to replace the late Antonin Scalia, who sided with the 5-4 majority on Heller. Baker said the NRA doesn't want the court to take another shot at the Second Amendment and reverse its decision on gun rights. ""If she were elected one of the first things she would be able to do is appoint a Scalia replacement who could overturn Heller,"" Baker said. That’s possible. Of course, there’s no guarantee the currently Republican-led Senate would agree to nominate someone with real or perceived anti-gun views. Nor is there a guarantee another similar case will come up anytime soon. Heller was the first time the Supreme Court had interpreted the Second Amendment since 1939, according to the Library of Congress. So what other proof does the NRA have? The backbone of its argument is a secretly taken audio recording from a private meeting last year in which Clinton criticized the Heller decision. The court ruled that the Second Amendment gives individuals the right to own weapons for self-defense, even though no such language appears in the Second Amendment. However, the case was not only about that single issue — more on that in a second — and in the audio Clinton never mentions anything about self-defense or individual rights. Instead, she is criticizing another aspect of the ruling, regarding the government’s ability to regulate guns. ""The idea that you could have an open carry permit with an AK-47 over your shoulder walking up and down the aisles of a supermarket is just despicable,"" Clinton is heard saying. ""So I’m going to speak out. … The Supreme Court is wrong on the Second Amendment, and I am going to make my case on that every chance I get."" Similarities to George W. Bush Clinton’s invocation of a machine gun and public carry might have sounded oddly familiar to George W. Bush. Those were two issues his administration was also concerned about during the Heller case. Conservatives and liberals alike might not like to hear this, but it’s true: Clinton’s stance is similar to Bush’s. They would likely disagree on specifics. Yet both have argued that the right to bear arms needs to be upheld, but that it’s not an absolute right and can be regulated, just like the right to free speech. Bush’s solicitor general, Paul Clement, wrote a brief on behalf of the government. He said the decision by the appeals court was too broad and asked the Supreme Court not to uphold it (the court ultimately did, leading to Clinton’s criticisms years later). The Bush administration wasn’t arguing that people have no individual right to own guns for self-defense. Instead, it was worried a favorable ruling could weaken the government’s ability in to restrict public access to machine guns or the carrying of weapons in public. Clement argued the decision ""could cast doubt on the constitutionality of existing federal legislation prohibiting the possession of certain firearms, including machineguns,"" and that the Second Amendment ""is not infringed by laws prohibiting the carrying of concealed weapons."" We doubt many people will accuse Clement — who represented the NRA at the Supreme Court a couple years after leaving the White House — or Bush of being anti-gun. And their concerns over machine guns and unrestricted carry were the same that Clinton was recorded talking about, which the NRA cited for its ad. Our ruling The NRA said Clinton ""doesn’t believe in your right to keep a gun at home for self-defense."" Clinton has never said that, nor could she do anything about it on her own even if she wanted to. She would need to rely on a new Supreme Court justice, who would first have to be approved by the currently Republican-led Senate. Clinton did say she disagreed with the Heller ruling, as the NRA points out. But she was talking about specifics and cited the same worries raised by the Bush administration, about looser restrictions on automatic weapons or carrying in public",False,"August 11, 2016"
"Says Barack Obama ""said black males are two times more likely to be shot by a law enforcement officer than white males"" and ""that is a lie"" because ""there is no data.""","On July 17, 2016, the day six officers were shot in Baton Rouge, La., Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. engaged in a testy interview about police shootings and race relations. About 2 minutes in, as the Fox News insider sat side-by-side with CNN anchor Don Lemon at the site of the Republican National Convention, Lemon abruptly went to a commercial as he and Clarke talked over each other. Clarke, a conservative who runs as a Democrat, was in Cleveland as a prime-time speaker at the GOP’s convention the following day. In the interview, Clarke made a claim about President Barack Obama and the police shooting of civilians during this exchange: Clarke: There is no data -- and you know this -- there is no data, there is no research that proves any of that nonsense. None. Even -- Lemon: You’d have to be more specific about what data and what nonsense you’re talking about. Clarke: That law enforcement officers treat black males different than white males in policing in these urban areas. Lemon: There is data that supports that. Clarke: There is not data. Lemon: The president spoke about it. Cedric Alexander, who’s a law enforcement officer -- Clarke: The president has been lying about it. He said it again the other day, when he said black males are two times more likely to be shot by a law enforcement officer than white males. Don, that is a lie. Lemon: That is not a lie. So, Clarke makes a two-part claim: 1. That Obama said black males are two times more likely to be shot by a law enforcement officer than white males. Is that what Obama said? 2. That the figure Obama cited is ""a lie"" because ""there is no data"" to back it up. In other words, are black males twice as likely as white males to be shot by police? In paraphrasing the president and calling a statistic a lie, even while saying there is no relevant data, Clarke makes a claim that’s on an important topic but in a somewhat muddled way. Let’s try to sort it out. What Obama said Clarke didn’t provide us any evidence that Obama said what he said he did. But the White House provided us, and PolitiFact National has annotated, what the president said July 7, 2016 in Warsaw, Poland. Obama spoke days after the fatal police shootings of two African-American men -- Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge and Philando Castile, in Falcon Heights, Minn. One statistic the president recited was: ""Last year, African-Americans were shot by police at more than twice the rate of whites."" So, Clarke was slightly off in his paraphrasing. Obama’s reference was to all African-Americans, not just African-American males. The statistic Now to the second part of Clarke’s claim -- whether it’s ""a lie"" because ""there is no data"" that black males are two times more likely than white males to be shot by a law enforcement officer. This is where Clarke goes more astray. The sheriff told us through a spokeswoman to ""read Heather Mac Donald's book, War on Cops. It's chock full of data that supports my position."" Mac Donald, a fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute for Policy Research in New York, told us she didn’t have any statistics on whether black males are more likely to be shot by police. Mac Donald did emphasize that how often black males are shot by police should be considered not in terms of what percentage black males are of the total population, but their rates of violent crime, since being involved in violent crime increases the likelihood of being shot by police. That view has been advanced by some criminologists. And the Washington Post, in its reporting on fatal shootings by police, has noted that a disproportionate number of murders and other violent crimes are committed by black Americans. The Post, which won a 2016 Pulitzer Prize for its work on fatal shootings by police, reported in July 2016 that, taking into account population, black Americans are 2.5 times as likely as white Americans to be shot and killed by police officers. (And The Guardian, which tracks people killed by police by shootings or any means, reported that in 2015, black people were killed by police at twice the rate of white, Hispanic and native Americans. ) But, again, those figures are for fatal police shootings. When it comes to the likelihood, by race and gender, of being shot by police, University Louisville criminology and criminal justice professor Justin Nix told us: ""We just don’t have the data to make a statement like that."" Nix and four other criminology and criminal justice professors told us there simply are no national figures on all police shootings. Said Samuel Walker at the University of Nebraska at Omaha: ""I’m cautiously optimistic,"" given the attention being paid to police shootings, ""that the FBI will begin collecting the data."" Our rating Clarke made essentially a two-part claim. He said that Obama ""said black males are two times more likely to be shot by a law enforcement officer than white males,"" but he was slightly off, in that the president spoke about all African-Americans and whites, not just males. Clarke also said the two times more likely statistic is ""a lie"" because ""there is no data."" He is correct that there is no national data on all police shootings -- fatal and non-fatal -- to back that statistic. But he goes too far in saying it is a lie, given that we don’t know if the statistic is accurate",Mostly False,"August 3, 2016"
"""We fixed a loophole in the (gun) background record check system so that we could make our commonwealth safer.""","Tim Kaine says he steered Virginia through some dark days as governor, but none was worse than April 16, 2007. That was the day a gunman murdered 32 students and faculty members at Virginia Tech before he took his own life. In the aftermath, Kaine says he turned his attention to Virginia’s gun laws. ""We fixed a loophole in the background record-check system so that we could make our commonwealth safer,"" Kaine told the Democratic National Convention on Wednesday while accepting his party’s nomination for vice president. Josh Schwerin, a Clinton campaign spokesman, backed Kaine’s statement by pointing to several articles about an executive order Kaine issued shortly  after the shootings. The order expanded the court records that are shared with law enforcement officials to ensure that mentally ill people who are deemed dangerous can’t buy firearms from licensed gun dealers. Federal law bars people who have been adjudicated ""mentally defective"" from purchasing firearms. But the Virginia Tech gunman, Seung-Hui Cho, cleared background checks in early 2007 to buy the two semiautomatic pistols he used in the massacre despite having been found by a judge to be a danger to himself in December 2005.   Cho was ordered to undergo outpatient care, but that record wasn’t shared with Virginia law enforcement officials, according to a state report on the shootings that was issued in 2009. As a result, Cho’s history wasn’t entered in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, and he was cleared to buy the firearms. Virginia’s laws were unclear about whether Cho’s mental health records were required to be sent to the state police so that they could be entered into national background check files. The issue centered around the fact that Cho had been ordered to undergo outpatient mental health treatment instead of being sent to an inpatient facility. While state law was clear that anyone admitted to an inpatient care facility couldn’t buy a gun, the law was ambiguous on whether someone ordered to undergo outpatient care was barred from buying a weapon, according to the 2009 state report examining the shootings. Kaine issued his executive order on April 30, 2007, two weeks after the Tech shootings. He mandated that state agencies collect information about people who are required to undergo mental health treatment ""whether on an inpatient or outpatient basis"" and send those records to state and federal databases to ensure they can’t buy a gun. Even with Kaine’s order, gaps remained. The Washington Post noted in an article that Kaine’s executive order wasn’t retroactive, meaning it only covered court orders made after its April 2007 enactment. Also, it didn’t address a loophole in state law that allows people to buy guns from unlicensed sellers without undergoing a background check. An unlicensed seller is someone who is not in the business of dealing firearms, such as a citizen seeking to sell a gun he keeps in his house. In 2008, the General Assembly passed a bill that enshrined Kaine’s executive order on mental health records into law. But Kaine failed in an effort to go one step further and close the loophole that allows private sales of guns without a background check. Our ruling Kaine said that while governor, ""We fixed a loophole in the background record check system so that we could make our commonwealth safer."" Kaine can legitimately take credit for plugging a gap in state law that allowed some mentally ill people to buy guns even after having been ordered by courts to get outpatient treatment",True,"July 29, 2016"
"""Ninety percent of Americans want our background check system strengthened and expanded to cover more gun sales.""","Democrats made a forceful argument for stricter gun control on the third night of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. One speaker, Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, called for expanded background checks in particular. ""Listen, 90 percent of Americans want our background check system strengthened and expanded to cover more gun sales so that dangerous weapons don't fall into the wrong hands,"" Murphy said. Under current law, background checks are required in sales by federally licensed gun dealers, but the checks are not required for gun sales by private sellers. National polls conducted over the past year consistently show that around 90 percent of Americans support some sort of expanded background checks for gun purchases. Here are a few examples of recent polls about background checks: Quinnipiac University poll, conducted June 21-27, 2016: ""Do you support or oppose requiring background checks for all gun buyers?"" Support: 93 percent. Oppose: 6 percent. Not sure: 1 percent. CNN/ORC poll, conducted June 16-19, 2016: Would you favor or oppose ""a background check on anyone attempting to purchase a gun in order to determine whether the prospective buyer has been convicted of a felony""? Favor: 92 percent. Oppose: 8 percent. CBS News poll, conducted June 13-14, 2016: ""Do you favor or oppose a federal law requiring background checks on all potential gun buyers?"" Favor: 89 percent. Oppose: 8 percent. Unsure/no answer: 2 percent. Public Policy Polling survey, conducted March 24-26, 2016: ""Do you support or oppose requiring a criminal background check of every person who wants to buy a firearm?"" Support: 84 percent. Oppose: 10 percent. Not sure: 6 percent. Quinnipiac University poll, conducted Dec. 16-20, 2015: ""Would you support or oppose a law requiring background checks on people buying guns at gun shows or online?"" Support: 89 percent. Oppose: 9 percent. Unsure/no answer: 1 percent. CBS/New York Times poll, conducted Oct. 21-25, 2015: ""Do you favor or oppose a federal law requiring background checks on all potential gun buyers?"" Favor: 92 percent. Oppose: 7 percent. Unsure/no answer: 1 percent. Gallup poll, conducted Oct. 7-11, 2015: ""Would you favor or oppose a law which would require universal background checks for all gun purchases in the U.S. using a centralized database across all 50 states?"" Favor: 86 percent. Oppose: 12 percent. Unsure: 2 percent. Quinnipiac University poll, conducted Sept. 17-21, 2015: ""Do you support or oppose requiring background checks for all gun buyers?"" Support: 93 percent. Oppose: 6 percent. Unsure/no answer: 1 percent. Pew Research Center poll, conducted July 14-20, 2015: Do you favor or oppose ""making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks?"" Favor: 85 percent. Oppose: 13 percent. Unsure/refused: 2 percent. Pew found that support for background checks spans all partisan and demographic groups, and it is also favored by a majority of households that own guns and those that do not. ""At the collective level, we know that Americans are in favor of the government instituting new checks on the ability to buy guns, which theoretically would prevent those who have some type of official negative record on file from buying them,"" wrote Gallup editor-in-chief Frank Newport in June. ""Americans have mixed feelings as to how effective they think these background check laws would be but overwhelmingly are willing to go along with them."" Some gun rights advocates have taken issue with this statistic for reasons such as the survey questions referring to the general idea of background checks rather than specific legislation. For example, in 2013, polls found that 90 percent of Americans supported expanded background checks. However, when Congress failed to pass a popular bill that would have increased background checks, 47 percent were disappointed or angry that it failed, while some 39 percent were relieved or very happy, according to a Washington Post/Pew Research Center poll. This highlights an odd discrepancy: While people overwhelmingly support specific gun policy ideas, like universal background checks and banning suspected terrorists from buying guns, the support is not as robust when it comes to actually expanding gun control. The October CBS/New York Times poll that found 92 percent support for expanded background checks also shows 46 percent of Americans think laws covering gun sales should be either made less strict or stay the same. Just 51 percent said the laws should be made more strict. ""People don't seem to like the idea of ‘gun control,’ but they still want the government to do more to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill,"" said Adam Winkler, a law professor at the University of California Los Angeles and author of Gunfight: The Battle over the Right to Bear Arms in America, in a prior interview with PolitiFact. Our ruling Murphy said, ""90 percent of Americans want our background check system strengthened and expanded to cover more gun sales.""

"Says Hillary Clinton ""wants to essentially abolish the Second Amendment.""","In officially accepting the GOP presidential nomination, Donald Trump tried to finesse one of his favorite but false attacks on the campaign trail: ""My opponent wants to essentially abolish the Second Amendment,""  Trump said July 21 in Cleveland. It’s nice that Trump added the word ""essentially,"" but the charge is still not without faults. When we last looked at the claim, we found no evidence that Clinton has ever said she wants to repeal or abolish the Second Amendment. She has called for stronger regulations, but continuously affirms her support for the right to bear arms. However, gun rights advocates argue that it’s reasonable to infer from a few comments that she wants to roll back the Second Amendment as it’s currently interpreted. Straight shooting on the campaign trail In both her 2008 and 2016 White House bids, Clinton has called for more gun control all the while saying she ""believes in the Second Amendment."" Here are a few examples of comments she’s made: • January 2008, Democratic presidential debate: ""I believe in the Second Amendment. People have a right to bear arms. But I also believe that we can common-sensically approach this."" • August 2015, in response to the on-air murders of a news crew in Virginia: ""We are smart enough, compassionate enough to balance legitimate Second Amendment rights concerns with preventive measures and control measures, so whatever motivated this murderer ... we will not see more needless, senseless deaths."" • January 2016, on Twitter: ""Nobody's attacking the Second Amendment. We can protect Americans' rights — and also protect families from gun violence. #GOPdebate"" • June 2016, on ABC’s This Week: ""I believe we can have common-sense gun-safety measures consistent with the Second Amendment."" (More on this later.) Setting aside the bulk of Clinton’s comments on protecting the Second Amendment (examples here, here, here, here, here and here), we’ll now go over three points that some gun rights advocates and experts say gives Trump’s charge some credence. Smoking guns? Clinton riled the gun lobby with two eyebrow-raising comments last fall and one from this spring. Clinton said in October 2015 a national gun buyback program like Australia’s compulsory program was ""worth looking into."" After a gunman killed 35 people in Port Arthur, Tasmania, in 1996, Australia banned semiautomatic and automatic weapons and enacted a mandatory buyback of the newly prohibited guns. That program is ""incompatible with private ownership of guns,"" Eugene Volokh, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, told us in May. (The National Rifle Association shares this view.) The full context of Clinton’s response, however, suggests she may have misspoken or not fully understood Australia’s program, as she also evoked voluntary buybacks as potential models for a U.S. program. Second, Clinton said in a leaked recording of a private fundraiser that she thinks the Supreme Court ""is wrong on the Second Amendment,"" referring to its landmark ruling in District of Columbia vs. Heller. In a 5-4 decision, the Court struck down Washington’s handgun ban and recognized that the Second Amendment applies to the individual’s right to bear arms. Experts who support gun rights told us undoing Heller basically ends the Second Amendment as currently interpreted. They pointed out that former Justice Department officials under President Bill Clinton and his appointees Stephen Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg argued in Heller that gun regulations do not violate the Second Amendment because it primarily pertains to a well-regulated militia, not the individual right to bear arms. Clinton, in her June interview on This Week, added fuel to the fire when she appeared to talk about the individual right as a hypothetical. ""Do you believe that their conclusion that an individual's right to bear arms is a constitutional right?"" host George Stephanopoulos asked. ""If it is a constitutional right, then it, like every other constitutional right, is subject to reasonable regulation,"" she responded. ""And what people have done with (the Heller) decision is to take it as far as they possibly can and reject what has been our history from the very beginning of the republic, where some of the earliest laws that were passed were about firearms."" The NRA and voices on the right seized upon these comments as proof that Clinton doesn’t really believe in the individual right to bear arms. But that ignores what she said immediately after: ""So I think it's important to recognize that reasonable people can say, as I do, responsible gun owners have a right — I have no objection to that. But the rest of the American public has a right to require certain kinds of regularity, responsible actions to protect everyone else."" UCLA Second Amendment expert Adam Winkler, meanwhile, said that the accuracy of Trump’s charge depends on Clinton’s grounds for rejecting Heller. (According to news reports from the 2008 election, she supported Washington’s handgun ban.) ""If she thought the reasoning was wrong, but the result right, then she would fit in with a number of strong pro-gun advocates,"" he said. ""If, however, she thought there should be no protection for gun rights, then Trump's claim comes closer to the truth."" The Clinton campaign previously told us Clinton ""believes Heller was wrongly decided in that cities and states should have the power to craft common sense laws to keep their residents safe."" This suggests Clinton disagrees with the court declaring the district’s ban on handguns unconstitutional, not necessarily the individual right itself — a position that’s more or less in line with the George W. Bush administration’s position on Heller of recognizing the right but allowing reasonable curtailment. Our ruling Trump said, ""My opponent wants to essentially abolish the Second Amendment."" The addition of the word essentially doesn’t change the accuracy of this claim. We found no evidence of Clinton ever saying verbatim or suggesting explicitly she wants to abolish the Second Amendment. The bulk of her comments suggest the opposite: She wants to enact stricter gun control, but has no objection to responsible gun ownership. Gun advocates say Trump’s claim is backed up by Clinton’s openness to a gun buyback program and her disagreement with a Supreme Court decision on the Second Amendment. But whether or not these cherry-picked comments actually reveal Clinton’s intentions is a matter of interpretation",False,"July 21, 2016"
"""There are at least twice as many licensed firearm dealers in California as there are McDonald’s.""","Gun control advocates make a lot of claims about how easy it is to get a firearm in America. ""We flood communities with so many guns that it is easier for a teenager to buy a Glock than get his hands on a computer or even a book,"" President Barack Obama said last week at a memorial service for five officers slain by a sniper in Dallas, Texas. PolitiFact rated the president’s claim Mostly False, noting it was a flawed comparison that relied on anecdotal rather than hard evidence. In California, Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom is among the state’s biggest gun control backers. He led the campaign to place Proposition 63, known as the Safety For All Initiative, on the state’s November ballot. It would require instant background checks for ammunition purchases; strengthen checks for gun purchases and ban the possession of large, detachable military-style magazines; and require the immediate surrender of firearms for people convicted of serious and violent crimes. The Safety For All campaign made a recent statement about the prevalence of gun dealers in California. It’s a colorful claim like Obama’s, but has a bit more hard data to back it up. ""There are at least twice as many licensed firearm dealers in California as there are McDonald’s,"" the campaign’s spokesman said in recent email. PolitiFact Georgia rated a similar claim in 2013 as Mostly True. A civil rights activist said: ""There are twice as many gun shops as McDonald’s in the United States."" Our California claim deals with licenses in this state only, and not necessarily brick-and-mortar gun shops. With our appetite piqued, we decided to dig into this fast-food-meets-firearms platter. Golden Arches Not surprisingly, there are many places in California to get a Big Mac -- more than a thousand, according to several sources. The American Enterprise Institute and the Foundation for Economic Education reported in April that, at that time, there were 1,165 McDonald’s in California. A Cal State Northridge study cited the same figure. A McDonald’s spokeswoman could not immediately confirm that figure. The company’s website, however, puts its nationwide restaurant total at more than 14,000. Assuming 1,165 is correct for California, there would need to be at least 2,330 licensed gun dealers in the state to make the campaign’s statement correct.  Photo by Mike Mozart / Flickr Gun dealers To be licensed in California, gun dealers must obtain both state and federal permits; be 21 or older; pay a $200 application fee; have a valid address; and undergo criminal and credit background checks. They don’t necessarily need a commercial storefront. Pinpointing the number of licensed gun dealers in the state is not simple. The Safety For All campaign referred us to data collected by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The ATF keeps a monthly log on its website of how many dealers and pawnbrokers are licensed to sell guns in each state. This month’s tally shows 2,315 dealers and pawnbrokers licensed to sell guns in California. That’s a shade less, 15 in fact, than twice as many McDonald’s. But the Safety For All campaign spokesman asserted there are hundreds more people authorized to sell guns in California, under different federal license categories.  Other categories Those extra federal categories include 521 licensed firearms manufacturers and 74 licensed firearms importers in California. Roger Root, who oversees firearm license investigations for the ATF in Northern California, said those nearly 600 licensed manufacturers and importers are, in fact, federally authorized to deal guns, even if they’re not technically called ‘dealers.’ ""We don’t require that they get an additional (federal) license,"" Root said. ""You are also allowed, in essence, to deal firearms."" That would bump the number of people licensed to sell guns in California closer to 2,900, more than twice as many McDonald’s. There's one wrinkle. About 5 percent or less of federal license holders, in all firearms categories, never go on to obtain an equivalent state firearms license required by the California Department of Justice, Root said. But taking 5 percent away from the 2,900, would still leave far more than twice as many McDonald’s. Our rating Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom’s Safety For All Initiative campaign recently claimed: ""There are at least twice as many licensed firearm dealers in California as there are McDonald’s."" Firearms license data tracked by the ATF show there are currently 2,315 authorized firearms dealers and pawnbrokers in the state. Two other categories authorized to deal firearms bring the total closer to 2,900, which is far more than double the 1,165 Golden Arches in California. A small fraction of the federal licensees never obtain their equivalent California permit. So, the total could be somewhat less than 2,900, but still enough to validate the statement",True,"July 19, 2016"
"Says Gary Farmer’s claim that he ""received an 'A' from the NRA"" is ""an absolute lie.""","In a duel for state Senate, two Democrats are battling over bad grades. Jim Waldman, a former four-term House member from Lauderdale-by-the-Sea, sees a bad grade from the National Rifle Association as a selling point. But Parkland lawyer Gary Farmer, his well-funded primary challenger for the newly redrawn District 34 seat, calls it a false advertisement. (Rep. Gwyndolen Clarke-Reed is also in the race.) Farmer’s campaign sent out emails and fliers claiming Waldman received an A grade from the NRA. You can see how this might be a problem for a Democrat in a heavily Democratic district like Fort Lauderdale. Waldman says it's not just a problem — it's wrong. He accused Farmer of being the liar, holding up his D from the NRA in 2010 and his voting record on gun legislation in the Florida House. ""Unfortunately, a political committee led by Gary Farmer is spreading lies about my record on guns,"" Waldman wrote in an email to his campaign subscribers. ""They’re spending tens of thousands of dollars mailing a FALSE claim to voters that I received an ‘A’ from the NRA."" He continued: ""Check the report card. Their claim is an absolute lie."" With both camps taking aim, PolitiFact Florida stepped into the ring. Throwing punches This fight started in early July, when Farmer’s campaign sent a mailer to residents of District 34 that said Waldman received an A from the NRA in 2010. In addition to fliers, Farmer also sent an email that claimed Waldman received an A rating for six years. This email included a screenshot from the NRA’s Political Victory Fund, which gives grades to politicians based on their support for Second Amendment rights. It also cited Project Vote Smart, a website that aggregates candidate information.  Farmer spokesman Jay Shannon said the NRA screenshot was captured July 1. Farmer’s camp also showed us another screenshot from Project Vote Smart showing Waldman with an A in 2010 (and an F in 2008). 
 PolitiFact was able to confirm the Vote Smart screenshot through the Wayback Machine, which archives web pages from the Internet. Shortly after the Farmer campaign took these screenshots, the campaign claims the grade changed from an A to a D on the NRA’s subscriber-only website. After the NRA changed its grade, Waldman spokeswoman Ashley Walker called Project Vote Smart to report an error on their site, and it also changed the grade from an A to a D on July 11. Project Vote Smart aggregates information from other organizations, so it makes sense it would change the grade if the NRA’s website reflected something different. But why did the NRA’s grade change in the first place? Farmer’s email suggests it was an inside job, claiming friends of Waldman in the NRA changed it on his behalf. But he has no proof to back this up, and the NRA tells a different story. Marion Hammer, the former president of the NRA and the executive director of the Unified Sportsmen of Florida, said Waldman never received an A from the NRA. Hammer said the NRA noticed the 2010 grade was listed as an A sometime this year, and changed it back to a D. ""Anyone who knows anything about Jim Waldman should know he would never get an A from (the) NRA and should be suspicious enough to check it out before using it,"" she said. Waldman has typically voted not to expand gun rights during his tenure in the House, with a few exceptions. In 2014, Waldman voted yes on two bills supported by the NRA. One bill, dubbed the ""Pop-Tart"" bill, relaxed Florida’s zero-tolerance policy in schools by prohibiting administrators from disciplining children for playing with simulated weapons. The bill passed 97-17, with 25 Democrats crossing party lines to vote for it. The other bill Waldman supported was the 2014 ""warning shot"" bill, partly inspired by Marissa Alexander, who was convicted in 2012 of three counts of deadly assault after firing a shot in the direction of her estranged husband and two of his children. She was sentenced to 20 years. Farmer described this bill as expanding Florida’s ""stand your ground"" law, but some law enforcement agencies said it actually made the law more difficult to enforce. This bill passed in the House 92-24, with 18 Democrats in favor. Hammer emphasized that the NRA changed the grade to correct the record, adding the NRA would never change grades as favors to candidates, no matter if they are aligned with the organization’s views or not. The real proof, she said, is in the magazines that the NRA Political Victory Fund sends out during election time (which can’t be hacked).

"Says Mark Kirk ""called for the mass arrest of 18,000 African Americans"" and ""was apparently fine with Trump’s #StillTooRacist call for mass deportation.""","In the hotly contested Illinois U.S. Senate race, Democratic challenger Tammy Duckworth is doing everything she can to link Republican incumbent Mark Kirk to Donald Trump. Even after Kirk said he would not support Trump on June 7, the Duckworth camp kept at it in this tweet:  That's a packed tweet. Is it true that Kirk called for the mass arrest of 18,000 African-Americans and, second, that Kirk had no objection to Trump’s call for mass deportation of undocumented immigrants? We checked the record. What Kirk said Duckworth's deputy campaign manager Matt McGrath said in an email she was referencing a statement Kirk made in May 2013 during an interview with Fox 32 Chicago political editor Mike Flannery. Kirk told Flannery: ""My top priority is to arrest the Gangster Disciple gang, which is 18,000 people. I would like to do a mass pickup of them and put them all in the Thomson Correctional Facility. I will be proposing this to the assembled federal law enforcement: ATF, DEA and FBI.""  Kirk made that statement in response to the January 2013 shooting death of 15-year-old Hadiya Pendleton, who was struck in the back by a stray bullet during a gang-related shooting on Chicago’s south side. The Gangster Disciples is an African-American gang from the city's south side and has an estimated 18,000 members, though its membership could be as high as 30,000, according to the Chicago Crime Commission’s press officer John Pastuovic. The statement drew criticism from the media as well as from Kirk’s colleagues in Congress, including U.S. Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Ill, who called the proposal an ""upper middle class elitist white boy solution to a problem he knows nothing about."" But Kirk acknowledged in July 2013 that his plan to arrest every member of the Gangster Disciples was ""not actually that practical."" Still, not only does Duckworth's tweet take what Kirk said out of context, it also implies he supported the general mass arrest of 18,000 African-Americans, even though Kirk never mentioned race or used the term ""African-Americans"" during his interview with Fox 32 Chicago. What about Kirk on deportation? And as for Duckworth’s claim that Kirk ""was apparently fine with Trump’s call for mass deportation?"" On May 4, Trump appeared on NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt, where he reiterated his plan to deport all 11 million undocumented immigrants if he were to become president. In a May 6 interview with CNN before Trump’s primary-clinching win in Indiana, Kirk said he would support Trump as the Republican nominee, calling Trump’s candidacy a ""net benefit"" for his own campaign in Illinois. Kirk withdrew his support for the presumptive GOP presidential nominee on June 7 after Trump said an American-born federal judge of Mexican ancestry couldn’t preside fairly over civil fraud lawsuits against the defunct Trump University because he has called for a wall to be built along the U.S.-Mexico border. While Kirk did back Trump knowing his position on illegal immigration, Kirk has made clear in the past he does not support Trump’s controversial immigration policies. In July 2015, Kirk told reporters at news conference he had a message for Trump: ""In a typical Chicago way, to my Mexican-American friends, I would say, 'Donald Trump callate' shut up."" And Kirk’s congressional voting record suggests he would not be ""fine"" with deporting 11 million immigrants living here illegally. Eleni Demertzis, the Kirk campaign’s communications director, noted in an email the senator supported and voted for the high-profile comprehensive immigration reform package in June 2013, which first would have secured the border and then created a tough but fair pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, among other things. But that measure never made it to a vote in the House. In addition to his pro-immigration reform stance, Kirk in October 2015 broke ranks with his party and was the only GOP Senator who voted to preserve federal funding for ""sanctuary cities."" However, Kirk did vote in favor of increasing penalties from two years to five years for illegal immigrants who re-enter the country illegally after being deported, denied entry or removed for other reasons, voting largely along party lines. Our ruling Duckworth tweeted: ""Kirk, who called for the mass arrest of 18,000 African Americans, was apparently fine with Trump’s #StillTooRacist call for mass deportation."" While Kirk did call for the mass arrest of the Gangster Disciples, an African-American gang estimated to have 18,000 members, Duckworth’s tweet takes Kirk’s statement out of context and gives the impression he had called for the general mass incarceration of 18,000 African-Americans. Duckworth also fails to acknowledge Kirk walked back his statement shortly after he made it. More importantly, Kirk did not mention race when he originally called for a ""mass pickup"" of the Gangster Disciples gang. As for Kirk being ""apparently fine"" with mass deportation, his congressional voting record on immigration shows he supports comprehensive reform that would both improve border security and implement a tough, but fair pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants -- not to mention he was the lone Republican senator to vote against legislation that would have withheld federal funds from sanctuary cities",False,"July 15, 2016"
"""We flood communities with so many guns that it is easier for a teenager to buy a Glock than get his hands on a computer or even a book.""","President Barack Obama attracted attention for a bold assertion about how easy it is to obtain a gun during his speech at an interfaith memorial service for five officers slain by a sniper in Dallas, Texas. ""As a society, we choose to underinvest in decent schools,"" he said. ""We allow poverty to fester so that entire neighborhoods offer no prospect for gainful employment. We refuse to fund drug treatment and mental health programs. We flood communities with so many guns that it is easier for a teenager to buy a Glock than get his hands on a computer or even a book, and then we tell the police, ‘You’re a social worker, you’re the parent, you’re the teacher, you’re the drug counselor.’"" Critics pounced on the Glock remark, saying Obama was making a misleading — or even outright false — comparison. But the White House said it had evidence to back up Obama’s line. So we decided to take our own look. What the White House says The White House offered PolitiFact several news reports to back up Obama’s case. The gist of these reports was that there are lots of guns to be found in low-income urban areas, but comparatively few books and relatively little access to the Internet. However, much of the evidence these articles provided was anecdotal, and none of the articles directly compared guns to computers or books --- not to mention Glocks, the specific make of handgun Obama cited. And none of the articles offered a rigorous academic comparison of the specific claim Obama made. For example: • One study by New York University researchers found a scarcity of children’s books in low-income areas of Detroit, Los Angeles and Washington. But the study looked at stores that sold books without taking into account public libraries or school libraries, which make obtaining books easier. More importantly, the study didn’t compare the availability of guns. • Several articles offered quotes by people familiar with low-income communities that included observations similar to what Obama said in Dallas. For instance, one Chicago resident told Al Jazeera America that getting a gun in her neighborhood is as easy as buying a pack of gum. ""If you want a gun, you can just go get a gun,"" she said. ""You got the money? You can get a gun."" And D. Watkins, a young, African-American writer from Baltimore who wrote The Beast Side: Living and Dying While Black in America, told public radio host Terry Gross that he bought his first gun ""from some dudes in the neighborhood that sold guns. It was simple. ... (It was) Business as usual. And it's still like that."" None of these accounts offered a direct comparison of guns’ availability compared with books or Internet access. • One link referenced an academic study about a lack of access to food in low-income areas, but it did not address either guns or books. • A news report cited research about the relative lack of Internet access in low-income households. But another article the White House provided said that while teens in families making less than $50,000 a year are less likely to have access to a desktop or a laptop computer than teens in higher income groups, the rate even for the lower-income group is still pretty high: All told, eight of every 10 of these lower-income teens had access to a computer. In all, we find the White House’s evidence unpersuasive on Obama’s specific claim. There’s no hard data making his comparison. And on the question of access to computers, we found data showing a relatively high rate of Internet access even among lower-income teens. Problems with the comparisons We considered the meaning of Obama’s remark a few different ways — but none provide a slam dunk for his argument. He said it was easier for a teen to obtain a Glock over a book or a computer. It might be easier for some people in some places, but it’s still against the law. ""It is already against federal law for someone under the age of 21 to buy a handgun, such as a Glock, from a licensed firearms dealer,"" said John R. Lott, Jr., president of the generally pro-gun Crime Prevention Research Center. And federal law on handguns also makes it unlawful for anyone ""to sell, deliver, or otherwise transfer (a handgun) to a person who the transferor knows or has reasonable cause to believe is a juvenile"" — that is, under 18. That means that any teen would have to break the law to make such a purchase. Alternately, they could barter for a handgun or steal one, which might be practical but would also be against the law. So let’s now consider the case of teens who are willing to break the law. One interpretation is whether a gun is cheaper to get than a book. Experts said the price of a ""street"" handgun can range between $50 and $500, depending on the local vagaries of supply and demand. Glocks in particular ""are very expensive,"" said Alan Lizotte, a criminal justice professor at the University at Albany. Street Glocks without a criminal history would be especially tough, he said. That would make them easily more expensive than books purchased at a store, and certainly more expensive than books borrowed for free from a library. ""There are 80 public libraries in Chicago and 95 public high schools and 92 private high schools in the city,"" Lott said. The second interpretation of Obama’s remark is the ease, or accessibility, of locating a gun. This is perhaps the most favorable interpretation for Obama, since credible research shows that there’s both a relative shortage of books and a relative surplus of guns in low-income neighborhoods. But it’s worth remembering that there don’t appear to be any studies that compare books and guns directly. In addition, there’s a lot of variation, neighborhood by neighborhood, across the country. ""If there’s lots of street-gang activity where you live, you may know someone who can get you a gun,"" said James Alan Fox, interim director of the School of Criminology and Criminal Justice at Northeastern University. ""If you live in a middle- or upper-middle class suburb, a gun may not be as accessible for a teenager. I wouldn’t know who to ask to buy a street gun."" Some points for Obama Experts acknowledged, though, that Obama had a point with his remark, even if he made an imperfect comparison. ""It is pretty easy for a teen to get a handgun at little cost and very quickly, at least in some places, including urban places,"" Lizotte said. That said, Jay Corzine, a sociologist and gun-policy expert at the University of Central Florida, called Obama’s framing ""weird."" ""The most credit I can give the president is that the statement may be true in a very small number of cases that are dependent on the context -- location, day of the week, time of the day, cash in hand,"" Corzine said. Our ruling Obama said, ""We flood communities with so many guns that it is easier for a teenager to buy a Glock than get his hands on a computer or even a book."" There’s little doubt that in some lower-income and high-crime neighborhoods, it is strikingly easy for even teens to acquire a handgun. On this, there is ample anecdotal evidence. But buying a gun is not likely to be cheaper than buying -- or borrowing -- a book or securing access to a computer, even for teens in poor neighborhoods. On multiple levels, Obama’s comparison is flawed",Mostly False,"July 14, 2016"
"In 2016, Dallas, Texas, has fewer ""police officer-related shootings than any large city in America.""","The morning after the ambush killing of five Dallas police officers, Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings said the police department has cultivated positive relationships with the Dallas community. The agency, he said, has trained in de-escalating encounters and community policing. ""I want to brag just for a second if anybody hasn't heard us say this,"" he said at a news conference July 8. ""This year, we have the fewest police officer-related shootings than any large city in America."" Rawlings made a similar claim on MSNBC’s Morning Joe that same day. Even though his statement is unclear, a spokesperson confirmed the mayor was referring to shootings by, not directed at, officers. We wanted to know if there was support for his statement. The best data we have suggests the mayor might be right, but we can’t know for sure. No nationwide data There is a major stumbling block with claims like these: There is no national database of police shootings. The FBI does collect some data on justifiable homicides by law enforcement, but it’s not broken down to the city level. The agency also issues a Law Enforcement Officers Killed and Assaulted report, but it only goes up to 2014 (and it doesn’t cover people killed or wounded by officers). To make matters more complicated, the FBI’s numbers are provided voluntarily by law enforcement agencies. (Only a small fraction of the 18,000 agencies who voluntarily participate in the program provide deadly force data.) ""Some cities would only report certain types of shootings,"" said Jonathan Maskaly, a criminology professor at the University of Texas at Dallas. ""Others would report everything. Cities with problems would tend to obfuscate."" Maskaly said verifying Rawlings’ claim — especially the ""all large cities"" component — is difficult without a comprehensive database. That said, we were able to find officer-related shooting data for specific police departments, as well as documentation of lethal force from media sources. These accounts, while limited, do show Dallas has a low number of shootings by police compared to other cities. Dallas vs. the rest of Texas The Washington Post tracks fatal police shootings nationwide, as does The Guardian. Both recorded the same incidents — five lethal shootings in Dallas in 2015, and one in 2016. A Dallas Police Department spokesperson pointed us to online officer-involved shooting data. The department’s ""officer-involved shooting"" data included lethal shots, shots that injured, and shots that missed. As a result of the broader parameters, the police department’s data shows 11 shootings in 2015, but still just one for 2016. There’s just one problem — the one shooting the newspapers found in 2016 is different from the one in Dallas’ data. The Guardian and Post included a shooting by a Mesquite Police Department officer in Dallas, whereas the police department data only counts its own officers. We did our own count using these three sources plus a Google News search. The result revealed one additional shooting by a Dallas officer. The numbers vary depending on if the data includes shootings by non-Dallas police officers that happened in Dallas (such as by the Mesquite Police Department) or just those by Dallas officers. Including non-DPD officers, there were 12 officer-involved shootings in Dallas in 2015 and three in 2016. Counting only the Dallas Police Department, however, there were 11 in 2015 and two in 2016. This is what Rawlings was referring to. What about other major Texas cities? We defined ""large city"" using the Census Bureau, looking at cities comparable to Dallas’ estimated 1.28 million people. Houston had 16 officer-involved shootings this year and 32 in 2015. San Antonio police reported five such incidents in 2016. Austin didn’t have available data, but an April news report counted five officer-involved 2016 shootings by the Austin Police Department as of that time. In total, there were two police-related shootings by Dallas police in 2016 — less than Houston, San Antonio and Austin. A broader look Rawlings said Dallas had fewer officer-related shootings than ""any large city"" in 2016, not just any large Texas city. So we looked around the country to see if any large departments reported fewer than the two police-related shootings we found by Dallas police. Data for the San Diego Police Department, captured by the county district attorney, show eight officer-involved shootings in 2015. We spoke to a county spokesperson, who told us there were three officer-involved shootings by the San Diego police in 2016. Officers of the Los Angeles Police Department shot 38 people in 2015. Data for 2016 wasn’t available, but scrolling through the LAPD’s press releases, we counted 11 officer-involved shootings. We also counted six officer-involved shootings in Las Vegas in 2016, at least 24 in 2015 for Chicago, and 21 in Phoenix for 2014.   The list of ""large cities"" could go on indefinitely, and there is no guarantee we wouldn’t eventually find one with less than the two officer-involved shootings from Dallas police. To keep it simple, we checked eight cities in addition to Dallas — including San Antonio, Houston, Austin, San Diego, Los Angeles, Chicago, Las Vegas and Phoenix. From what we could find, Dallas police had the lowest number (two) of officer-involved shootings in 2016. Other measures Experts agreed that Dallas had a low number of officer-involved shootings compared to other cities. ""If the data is correct — I would agree that Dallas has a low number of police shootings especially when compared with similar size cities,"" said David Hurley, assistant professor of criminal justice at Texas A&M University. However, counting the number of police shootings is the wrong metric to consider, said John Worrall, professor of criminology at the University of Texas at Dallas. He and Maskaly both pointed to shootings-per-officer or shootings-per-capita as more informative measure. However, there is no available data for strictly 2016 on that point. The Better Government Association published  a July 2015 study of fatal police shootings in major cities between 2010-2014. Looking at that data, which is compiled via public records requests from police departments, Dallas had 34, more than San Antonio (28), San Diego (17) and San Jose (11). Dallas also had higher fatal shootings-per-capita than several cities during that period, including those with more fatal shootings overall such as Chicago and New York City. Our ruling Mayor Rawlings said Dallas had fewer officer-related shootings in 2016 than any other large city. There is no national database to compare Dallas with every single other large metropolitan area, so it is nearly impossible to verify that side of the claim. However, numerous sources suggest Dallas does, in fact, have a low number of officer-involved shootings compared to cities of similar sizes with available data",Half True,"July 12, 2016"
"California’s Proposition 63 would ""CRIMINALIZE the sharing of ammunition between friends who may be hunting or shooting together."""," Proposition 63, a gun and ammunition control initiative on California’s November ballot, would require instant background checks for the sale of ammunition statewide. Known as the Safety For All Initiative and proposed by Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, the measure is considered a significant addition to California’s already strict gun regulations. The initiative is in some cases more stringent than gun control bills introduced by state Senate leader Kevin De León and recently signed into law by Gov. Jerry Brown. Recently, a gun rights group, the Firearms Policy Coalition, in a June 16 email blast claimed Proposition 63 would restrict not only ammo sales, but ""criminalize the sharing of bullets between hunting and shooting partners."" The Sacramento-based coalition describes itself as a grassroots nonprofit dedicated to defending Second Amendment rights. We decided to examine the claim: Would Proposition 63 really criminalizes the sharing of bullets between friends? Our research We started by checking the text of the Proposition. It broadly restricts ammunition sales by requiring instant background checks and requiring, by January 2018, all sales ""be conducted or processed through a licensed ammunition vendor,"" according to Section 8 of the text. Law enforcement would be exempted. Currently, the state does not require a license or record keeping for ammunition sales, according to the San Francisco-based Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. By contrast, the restrictions Proposition 63 places on sharing or ""transferring"" ammunition are not as strict. Still, they would change some aspects of the largely unregulated practice. The measure would: -- Make it illegal for an individual to share bullets with ""any person who he or she knows or using reasonable care should know"" is banned from owning or possessing ammunition; -- Make it illegal for someone to share bullets if they know they will be subsequently sold or transferred to a person banned from owning them; -- Require individuals meet face-to-face to transfer ammunition; The new crimes would be classified as a misdemeanors, punishable by up to one year in jail and a $1,000 fine, according to the measure. They are listed under proposed changes to Sections 30306 and 30312 of the California Penal Code. ""They could still freely transfer and share that ammunition with their hunting and shooting partners provided that they do so in person and do not have knowledge that the ammunition would subsequently be provided to a felon or other prohibited person,"" Dan Newman, spokesman for the Safety For All Initiative, wrote in an email. Representatives from the Firearms Policy Coalition did not respond to our requests for comment. An AK-47 rifle 30-round magazine is seen with 30 rounds of 7.62x39mm ammunition, in Alexandria, Va., Wednesday, Feb. 10, 2016. (AP Photo/Cliff Owen) Our ruling The Firearms Policy Coalition recently claimed California’s Proposition 63 would ""Criminalize the sharing of ammunition between friends who may be hunting or shooting together."" The initiative would create some new restrictions on bullet sharing. It would be it illegal to knowingly share bullets with a felon; to share with any other person banned from owning them; or with anyone who would subsequently share them with a banned person. It would also require people meet face-to-face to transfer ammunition. Breaking the new rules would be considered a misdemeanor. The coalition’s statement, however, gives the wrong and overly broad impression that friends on a hunting trip or at a shooting range could never legally share a bullet -- that somehow the measure would ""criminalize"" all aspects of sharing a box of bullets with your shooting partner. Instead, the vast majority of people could keep sharing, as long as they know or within reason should know they’re not sharing with a felon or another person prohibited from owning a gun and ammunition",Mostly False,"July 12, 2016"
"""40% of Americans know someone who has been killed by a gun.""","In the wake of the Orlando shootings and lacking congressional action regarding gun reform legislation, many are calling attention to the the devastating truths about gun violence in the United States. One of the vocal supporters advocating for tighter gun restrictions is Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla. Wasserman Schultz took to her Medium page to lament the occurrence at Pulse Night Club and to express the need for stricter gun legislation that she believes can prevent future gun violence fatalities, especially by suspected terrorists. In her June 18, 2016, post, Wasserman Schultz wrote that ""40% of Americans know someone who has been killed by a gun — gun violence has touched someone you know."" Many other politicians have made many claims regarding gun violence, but this assertion seemed particularly far-reaching. Do two out of every five Americans know someone whose death can be attributed to a gun? We took a closer look. The evidence We reached out to one of Wasserman Schultz’s campaign representatives, and they told us that the 40 percent figure came from an October 2015 Huffington Post article that cited a YouGov poll from the same month. YouGov is an online market research organization that utilizes a network of over 4 million users who offer their personal views and experiences by participating in surveys. The poll that Wasserman Schultz refers to surveyed 1,000 U.S. adults selected by a random sample stratified by age, gender, race, education and region. One of the questions asked in the survey was, ""Do you personally know anyone who has been killed by another person with a gun?"" The poll found that 22 percent said yes, with 6 percent saying the person was in their family and the other 16 percent saying it was someone else they knew. Another question asked, ""Do you personally know anyone who has committed suicide using a gun?"" On that question, 28 percent of participants answered yes, with 7 percent knowing a family member who used a gun to commit suicide and 21 percent saying they knew someone else who committed suicide with a gun. The 40 percent figure asserted by the Huffington Post article as well as in Wasserman Schultz’s Medium post come from the total percentage of participants who had professed to knowing someone who had died because of a gun. The 40 percent figure is reached once you take into account the overlap between the respondents who knew both a homicide and a suicide victim. We reached out to to Peter Moore of YouGov, who published the poll online, to ask if Wasserman Schultz’s claim accurately encapsulated the results. ""I’ve had a look at the full dataset, and I can confirm that the 40 percent figure is accurate,"" Moore said. ""Her statement does properly capture the poll’s findings. It is also consistent with other similar survey data."" We asked Moore about possible sources of error in the survey, and he responded, ""There are none in particular beyond the general margins of error associated with surveys,"" which was determined to be 4.1 percent by YouGov. To contextualize the YouGov poll, we reached out to James Alan Fox, a professor of criminology, law and public policy at Northeastern University. While not debating the results or methodology of the poll, he did offer some caveats. He noted that suicides account for a large share of the deaths -- a fact that may not be obvious from Wasserman Schultz’s statements. He also said that the poll’s wording leaves a fair amount of interpretation to the respondent. Respondents ""have to decide how well they know someone,"" he said. ""There are better ways to write questions like this so it’s not so vague."" In all, the way the questions were worded may make the percentage sound ""a lot worse than it is,"" Fox said. Past data While there have been many surveys conducted regarding guns and gun violence, the most similar polls to the YouGov poll were surveys conducted in 1993 and 1999 by Gallup. The question in both years was, ""Not including military combat, has anyone close to you--such as a friend or relative--ever been shot by a gun?"" In 1993, 64 percent responded no and 36 percent responded yes. In 1999, the percentage of people answering yes dropped to 31 percent, compared to 69 percent responding no. It’s important to note that the Gallup questions refer to people getting shot -- a larger universe than those getting shot and killed. So, it’s not a direct comparison. Though the Gallup results can by no means confirm or refute YouGov and Wasserman Schultz’s claim, the numbers do not appear drastically different. With limited inquiry into the number of people who are close to victims of gun violence, it is difficult to ascertain a clear estimate. Our ruling Wasserman Schultz said, ""40 percent of Americans know someone who has been killed by a gun ."" Wasserman Schultz is right about the 40 percent figure if you consider the YouGov poll findings. It’s important to note that a majority of the 40 percent figure comes from suicide deaths, not homicides. And there is limited research on this topic generally",Mostly True,"July 7, 2016"
"""If you're a terrorist you can't fly,"" but ""an assault weapon you can buy.""","On Facebook and Twitter, U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore describes herself as a mother and grandmother who ""loves poetry, reading, knitting and crocheting."" With poetry, she not only reads, she writes. The Milwaukee Democrat has penned odes that tweak job creators and Republican Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. (There are videos of her reciting both.) Most recently, Moore turned her rhyming to guns. On June 23, 2016, about a week after the Orlando mass shooting, she tweeted out her poem, ""No More Moments of Silence."" One line reads: How ironic that if you're a terrorist you can't fly / But quite moronic that an assault weapon you can buy. Leaving aside the adjectives, let’s check the veracity of the verse. Two lists Moore’s claim alludes to two U.S. government lists whose origins stem from 9/11. 1. Terrorist watchlist: The Terrorist Screening Database, commonly called the ""terrorist watchlist,"" contains people ""known or reasonably suspected to be or have been engaged in terrorism or terrorist activities."" It helps agencies ""identify known or suspected terrorists trying to obtain visas, enter the country, board aircraft, or engage in other activity."" As of mid-June 2016, there were about 1 million people on the terrorist watchlist, though fewer than 5,000 were Americans, according to a federal agencies memo to Congress. 2. No Fly List: This is a subset of the terrorist watchlist. People on the no fly list are ""prohibited from boarding a commercial aircraft that will fly into, out of, over, or within United States airspace."" A person can be added to that list if there is ""credible information that demonstrates the individual poses a threat of committing a violent act of terrorism with respect to civil aviation, the homeland, United States interests located abroad, or is operationally capable of doing so.""   There are about 81,000 people on the no fly list, including fewer than 1,000 Americans. A key difference between the two lists, of course, is there is no constitutional right to fly but there is one to own a gun. Moore’s claim The first part of Moore’s claim, that terrorists can’t fly, is pretty straightforward. You don’t have to be a known terrorist to be prohibited from flying. As we noted, people who the government believes pose a threat of committing terrorism in connection with air travel, and are on the no fly list, also are prohibited. The second part of her claim -- that terrorists can buy assault weapons -- goes a bit too far, in that not all of the people on the terrorist watchlist are terrorists. Many are only suspected to be involved in terrorist activities and, like the Orlando shooter was, are removed from the list.  Moreover, terrorists who have been convicted of a felony, or are under indictment, can’t legally buy a gun. But Moore’s point, contrasting the no fly list with the terrorist watchlist, is on target in that people on the watchlist can buy guns. Under federal law, there is no basis to automatically prohibit a person from possessing firearms simply because they appear on the terrorist watchlist. There must be some other disqualifying factor, such as a felony conviction, illegal immigration status, or being under indictment. In fact, from 2004 through 2015, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office, individuals on the terrorist watchlist were involved in firearm or explosives background checks 2,477 times, of which 91 percent were allowed to proceed. Our rating Moore said: ""If you're a terrorist you can't fly,"" but ""an assault weapon you can buy."" Terrorists, as well as people deemed potential terrorists who are on the federal government’s no-fly list are prohibited from flying. Terrorists who have a felony conviction can’t legally buy guns, but people on the government’s terrorist watchlist can, assuming they aren’t disqualified for some other reason",Mostly True,"July 1, 2016"
"The Orlando shooter used ""a weapon of war.""","In the aftermath of the shooting at an Orlando nightclub, Democratic politicians -- including U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin -- reignited the debate on gun control. Just a few days after the shooting at the nightclub that catered to the gay community, Baldwin, the first openly gay member of the Senate, appeared on the Wisconsin Public Television show Here and Now. ""Now several days after this mass shooting in Orlando, as a member of the LGBTQ community, how are you processing what happened?"" host Frederica Freyberg asked. ""Oh it’s just horrific,"" Baldwin said. ""It’s simply horrific. And you know I juxtapose the opportunity to kick off PrideFest in Milwaukee the Friday before the massacre and the celebration of how far we’ve come in the LGBT community to fight bullying, discrimination and violence turned on members of the LGBT community. ""And then to wake up Sunday morning to this devastating, devastating news -- the worst gun violence in modern U.S. history,"" she continued. ""And you know, to take in the fact that this was a U.S. citizen inspired by terrorists who legally purchased a weapon of war and turned it on the LGBT community."" We’ve heard others use the phrase ""weapon of war"" to describe the guns used by mass shooters. So, we thought we’d find out if Baldwin is right. Does the military use the same weaponry the Orlando shooter did? Civilian vs. military guns The Orlando shooter, Omar Mateen, had two firearms the night he killed 49 people and wounded 53 others in a Florida nightclub -- a rifle and a 9mm handgun. Both were purchased legally. The rifle was a Sig Sauer MCX semiautomatic. That is what Baldwin meant when she cited ""a weapon of war"" and what we are looking at in this factcheck. Baldwin’s claim was a very stark one. While guns of many varieties may be used in battle, we view the phrase ""a weapon of war"" in this context to mean a gun used by the military. As backup, Baldwin’s team sent us to a couple news articles and gun reviews. The first news article, dated June 16, 2016, was from the Associated Press and carried the headline, ""Rifle used in Orlando shooting was designed for military use."" Her staff also pointed us to videos from the rifle’s manufacturer and highlighted some portions of the videos, including a point when Kevin Brittingham, president of the company’s silencer division, says ""the Sig MCX was designed to meet the DOD (Department of Defense) requirement for a weapon that would be as compact as possible, that focused on signature reduction. (They) wanted something as quiet as possible and also wanted something that would engage targets out to 300 meters."" But it’s not that simple. The article and the video don’t address the differences between the guns issued to soldiers and those sold to civilians. The Sig Sauer MCX rifle Mateen carried is a civilian version of the MCX-MR, a gun designed for military use. The MCX-MR was designed to comply with a Department of Defense requirement for a weapon to be carried by special operations units with low visibility in terms of size and noise. A backgrounder on the gun from the Violence Prevention Center sent to us by Baldwin’s team said, ""there are no significant differences between them and military assault weapons."" But Leigh Neville, a military researcher and author of the book ""Guns of the Special Forces,"" said the two versions differ ""fundamentally."" The civilian MCX lacks three key design attributes that make the MCX-MR suitable for special operations use. 1.  The civilian version is semiautomatic, rather than fully automatic. A semiautomatic gun fires one round of ammunition for every press of the trigger whereas a fully automatic gun fires a burst of rounds with every trigger press. 2.  The civilian weapon does not feature a silencer, though one can be purchased and attached with separate approval. A special operations soldier would be issued a silencer with the rifle. 3. The civilian version does not have all the options for differing barrel lengths and shoulder stocks as the military version to make the guns lighter and easier to carry. The shorter barrel options, which decrease the speed at which the ammunition is propelled, would be illegal or restricted for civilians under federal laws. Weapons like the M16 and M4, the primary weapons used by United States military, do have these attributes. ""If it was a weapon of war, it would be a machine gun,"" said Steven Howard, a competitive shooter and gun expert. ""If a weapon of war is simply that it resembles a military firearm, then absolutely positively every weapon is a weapon of war."" So, the gun used by Mateen isn’t really a military weapon. But not everyone agrees the differences are significant, arguing the killing power of civilian and military guns is similar and that there are many physical similarities as well. ""Civilian semiautomatic assault weapons incorporate all of the anti-personnel features of design and function that make assault weapons so deadly,"" said Marty Langley, senior policy analyst with Violence Prevention Center. Langley and others note that the weapon Mateen used is also very different from guns typically used for, say, hunting. High-capacity ammunition magazines can be attached to guns like the MCX to hold extra rounds of ammunition. Additional grips like a forward grip or barrel shroud give shooters greater control for spray firing. In the end, guns like the one used by Mateen are more advanced than the typical civilian weapon but not quite military weapons. PolitiFact Florida rated a related claim from U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson, an Orlando-area Democrat, about the power of guns like the one Mateen used. Grayson said the gun Mateen had ""shoots off 700 rounds in a minute."" Grayson was referring to an AR-15, another civilian weapon modeled after military weapons, in this case the M16. The M16 has a cyclic rate of fire, a theoretical measure, of 700 to 900 rounds per minute, according to U.S. Army documents. The ""maximum effective rate of fire,"" the highest rate of fire that can still achieve target hits, is about 150-200 rounds per minute. But that’s much greater than what most mass shooters achieve with semiautomatic rifles. Gary Kleck, a Florida State University criminologist, said that based on his research on mass shootings, most shooters rarely fire more than 50 rounds per minute. Grayson’s claim was rated Mostly False, as the weapon would need to be converted from an semiautomatic into an automatic weapon to even come close to shooting 700 rounds a minute. Our rating Baldwin said the Orlando shooter used ""a weapon of war."" Baldwin backed up her statement by showing that the gun Mateen had was originally designed for military use. But he had a civilian version of that gun that lacks key attributes of a military-style weapon. However, it’s also significantly different from weapons typically used by civilians for hunting. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details",Half True,"July 1, 2016"
"Says Kelly Ayotte ""stands with the Washington gun lobby. They fund her campaigns.""","The ad cuts to a shadowy close-up of a man and woman shaking hands, as if they'd just made a deal, superimposed over a stack of $100 bills.  The narrator explains: ""She stands with the Washington gun lobby. They fund her campaigns.""  The 30-second spot attacks Republican U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte's record on gun control measures as she faces a tough re-election bid against New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan, a Democrat.  Sponsored by the political action committee for Americans for Responsible Solutions, the ad’s ominous tone and imagery leave the viewer with the impression that Ayotte doesn’t care what her constituents want because she’s in the pocket of well-heeled firearms lobbyists. It’s a line of attack used in the wake of the Orlando shootings and the Senate’s votes on gun control legislation. It has also employed by New Hampshire Democrats. ""Ayotte puts her gun lobby backers before the safety and security of New Hampshire,"" Ray Buckley, chairman of the state Democratic Party, said in a June 21 statement. PolitiFact New Hampshire wondered how much the ""gun lobby"" is really spending on Ayotte’s campaign. We’ve recently looked into Ayotte’s voting history on expanded background checks. Now, we’ll focus on the financial supporters of her campaign. Following the money A review of campaign finance records shows that Ayotte has accepted at least $7,450 in donations from the most prominent lobbying group, the National Rifle Association, over her career. Over the course of Ayotte’s career, according to the database, gun rights groups have given her campaign or leadership PAC a total of $68,595. This total includes donations from the NRA as well as other groups such as the National Shooting Sports Foundation. It also includes donations from individuals who have a pattern of making political contributions supporting gun rights, which most people wouldn’t associate with the ""Washington gun lobby."" Americans for Responsible Solutions communications director Mark Prentice said the data in the OpenSecrets database makes it ""absolutely clear"" that gun rights groups fund her campaign. Beyond direct campaign contributions to Ayotte, those groups have spent another $12,500 in independent expenditures to support her, bringing the sum to more than $80,000. But it’s important to keep those numbers in context.  The average U.S. Senate campaign costs more than $10 million, according to a study by MapLight.org, a nonpartisan group that studies money in politics. As she prepared for a contentious reelection battle, Ayotte reported having $6.9 million cash on hand in the last fundraising report March 31. In other words, the money she’s received -- directly or indirectly -- from gun lobbyists during her political career represents about 1 percent of the cash she has on hand right now. When compared against the $12.4 million she’s raised since she first became a candidate in the 2010 cycle, it’s 0.65 percent of her lifetime fundraising. And Ayotte’s $7,450 from the NRA pale in comparison to what the group gave to its top recipient in Congress, Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona. McCain has received $37,150 in direct support and more than $7 million in independent expenditures for him and against his opponents, according to OpenSecrets records dating back to 1989. ""The ad is misleading because the contributions cited equal only about half a percent of the total amount raised by our campaign over her career,"" Ayotte’s campaign spokeswoman Liz Johnson said in an email statement. Meanwhile, the group that’s running the ad, Americans for Responsible Solutions, was founded by former Rep. Gabby Giffords, an Arizona Democrat and mass-shooting survivor. It has spent $834,278 in independent expenditures against Ayotte’s candidacy, according to OpenSecrets. That’s about 10 times the amount of money spent on Ayotte’s campaign by pro-gun groups. Ayotte’s gun-policy views The ad also claims Ayotte ""stands with the Washington gun lobby"" in return for the donations she’s received, but that hasn’t universally been the case. Ayotte received an ""A"" rating from the NRA in 2012, meaning she was viewed as a ""solidly pro-gun"" candidate.  The NRA and associated groups have taken out ads supporting Ayotte in the past. ""Thank you for protecting the rights of gun owners, hunters and all who cherish the freedoms of our Second Amendment,"" one ad from from the National Shooting Sports Foundation said. Another ad came from an organization called the The New Hampshire Men and Women of the National Rifle Association.   However, her voting record has not always adhered to the NRA’s stances. On June 20, for instance, Ayotte backed two bills blocking gun sales to suspected terrorists -- a switch from when she voted to kill a similar Democratic plan in December. A day later, she co-sponsored a bipartisan gun control bill with U.S. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine to strengthen existing background check laws, which the NRA opposed. Collins, one of the Senate’s most moderate Republicans, has a C+ rating from the NRA.   Our ruling The gun control group Americans for Responsible Solutions said Ayotte ""stands with the Washington gun lobby. They fund her campaigns."" Ayotte has indeed benefited from money from gun rights groups – $81,095 over her career, to be exact. But it’s worth adding some context -- that’s about one-half of one percent of the total money she’s raised, and a modest amount compared to other Senate Republicans. Meanwhile, it’s not entirely correct to say that Ayotte always ""stands with the Washington gun lobby."" She has voted for legislation favored by the NRA, but has also bucked the NRA on at least one occasion",Half True,"June 30, 2016"
"Says ""Paul Ryan shut off the C-SPAN cameras when the Democrats started their sit-in.""","It was June 22, 2016. House Democrats had staged a sit-in on the floor of the House to try to force a vote on gun-control legislation. The House, in response, went into recess and the cameras in the House chamber were shut off. It may not sound like the makings of a viral late-night joke, but stay tuned. Undaunted, Democrats started transmitting video and images of the sit-in via social media tools such as Periscope, a live video streaming app. The sit-in, which House Speaker Paul Ryan subsequently blasted as a publicity stunt, lasted 26 hours. The Late Show with Stephen Colbert carried a 25-second comedy bit about the event, which began with a pan up the facade of the Ed Sullivan Theater, where the show is taped, followed by a quick cut to Colbert, holding a dog and sitting on a couch with supervising producer and writer Paul Dinello. Both were watching the feed from the House floor on a wall-mounted TV. ""Why am I watching Congress on Periscope?"" Colbert asks. ""That's because Paul Ryan shut off the C-SPAN cameras when the Democrats started their sit-in,"" Dinello responds. ""Really?"" Colbert responds. ""Wow, what a petty son of a —"" Suddenly the picture cuts to a cartoon of Ryan holding two ends of an unplugged power cord and the sign, ""Sorry! Technical Difficulties.""  The crowd inside the Ed Sullivan Theater cackled. But they didn’t have the full story. Did Ryan really shut off the C-SPAN cameras in the House chamber? Facebook posts said yes. Elizabeth Warren tweeted, ""@SpeakerRyan shut off the camera so you can't watch. Shameful."" The Daily Show said so as well. The real answer is no. Congress' rules for operating the cameras — which Congress controls — call for video transmission to end as soon as the gavel goes down for recess or adjournment. What happened when the protest started Roll Call provided a good timeline of the protest and the reaction of Republicans. The House was in session and cameras were rolling the morning of June 22. Lawmakers were in something called  ""Morning Hour,"" which basically allows members to speak to any issue. At about 11:25 a.m., Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., took to the House floor with a group of Democrats and demanded lawmakers vote on gun legislation. Rep. John Larson, D-Conn., spoke next with a similar message. At that point, Larson yielded the floor to Lewis, who said, ""Now is the time to find a way to dramatize it, to make it real."" Lewis and a number of Democrats then sat down in the House well. At the time, Ryan wasn't at the speaker's rostrum. The presiding officer was Rep. Daniel Webster, R-Fla. Webster, after conferring with House staff, declared a recess. When Webster declared the recess, the cameras in the House went dead. About a half-hour later, around noon, Republicans tried to gavel the House back into session and the cameras came back on. Again, Ryan was not the presiding officer. This time it was Rep. Ted Poe, R-Texas. Democrats remained in the well of the House. Poe declared that the House ""is currently not in a state of order"" and called another recess. The cameras went black again. Fast-forward to shortly after 10 p.m. The House came back into session and the cameras turned on again. This time, Ryan asked Democrats to end the protest. They didn't, and the protest continued as Republicans struggled off and on to conduct some House business into the early morning hours. At 3:13 a.m., they adjourned until Friday, and the cameras were turned off. The key point The main takeaway in all of this is what triggered the camera going on and off. The camera was off because the House was not in session, not because of an order from Ryan. That's been a House standard going back years.  This isn't the first time this has happened. During a sit-in eight years ago, cameras were cut for the Republicans when Democrats controlled the House. Minority Leader John Boehner wanted a vote on offshore oil drilling, a motion to adjourn was passed, and the C-SPAN cameras were turned off. The Republicans kept talking anyway. In that case, the lights and the microphones were turned off for a while as well. Yet the Republicans kept talking. As Politico reported, ""Democratic aides were furious at the GOP stunt."" That protest lasted five hours. But back then, social media and video streaming services weren’t in the palms of every lawmaker’s hand. When the Democrats staged the latest protest, several members were broadcasting on Facebook and Periscope. C-SPAN picked up both feeds and continued to show the events, using the same style and logos they use when they're tapping into the House cameras. We note that, in the sketch, Colbert isn't the person saying, ""Paul Ryan shut off the C-SPAN cameras when the Democrats started their sit-in."" But just as we make candidates responsible for all the statements in their ads, we have no doubt Colbert approved this message. A CBS spokeswoman, who identified Dinello for us, declined comment on the content of the sketch. Our ruling The Late Show with Stephen Colbert asserted that Ryan ""shut off the C-SPAN cameras when the Democrats started their sit-in."" Ryan didn't order the cameras shut off in response to the protest. They were turned off because House Republicans declared the House session in recess. That's a standard policy of Congress, even if it was Republicans making the decision",Mostly False,"June 27, 2016"
"""You can’t get on an airplane, but more than 2,000 people on that list have been able to buy a gun.""","During the chaos of a sit-in protest by Democrats on the House floor this week, California Rep. John Garamendi, D-Fairfield, delivered an impassioned, unscripted plea to tighten America’s gun laws. The rare and sometimes raucous demonstration came in the wake of the deadly Orlando nightclub shooting. Garamendi urged a vote on the proposed ‘No fly, no buy’ legislation to ban individuals on the FBI’s ""no fly"" list from legally purchasing guns. That list is a subset of the FBI’s much larger terrorist watch list. Estimates place about 10,000 Americans on the terrorist watch list and a small fraction on the no fly list. Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of individuals from other countries are estimated to be on the comprehensive list. During his speech, Garamendi made a claim about people tied to terrorism buying guns in the U.S. ""You can’t get on an airplane, but more than 2,000 people on that list have been able to buy a gun. This is not only crazy; it is downright dangerous,"" Garamendi told his colleagues on June 22, 2016. Rep. Garamendi makes the claim we fact-checked at the 4:10 minute mark in this video. With his airplane reference, Garamendi appears to be referring to the no fly list. We decided to check whether 2,000 people on that smaller tally have successfully purchased guns in the U.S. Sorting out the facts A U.S. Government Accountability Office analysis of FBI data shows nearly 2,500 successful applications for firearms by individuals on the terrorist watch list over the past decade. Garamendi’s spokesman pointed us to this GAO analysis. We fact-checked a similar statement in December by California Rep. Mike Thompson, D-St. Helena. After the San Bernardino shooting, he said, ""Since 2004, more than 2,000 suspected terrorists have legally purchased weapons in the United States."" We rated Thompson’s claim Mostly True, relying on a similar GAO analysis. We noted, however, that an audit showed many people still on the list are no longer suspected of having ties to terrorism, bringing into question the term ""suspected terrorists."" The GAO analysis does not say how many people on the smaller no fly list applied for firearms. The office has said in the past it was not able to share that information because the Transportation Security Administration ""considers the no-fly list numbers sensitive information,"" according to a December fact check by the Washington Post. It’s safe to assume, however, that there have been far fewer guns purchased by people on the smaller no fly list than the larger one. We asked Garamendi’s spokesman to further clarify the congressman’s comments, but we have not yet heard back. Our ruling Rep. John Garamendi said this week ""You can’t get on an airplane, but more than 2,000 people on that list have been able to buy a gun."" He appears to be talking about the TSA’s ‘no fly’ list. Garamendi connected the right number with the wrong register. His claim has a wisp of truth in that people on the larger terrorist watch list, including the much smaller no fly list, have made more than 2,000 successful firearm purchases over the past decade. But it strains reason, and seems mathematically impossible, that most of those purchases came from people on the no fly list",Mostly False,"June 24, 2016"
"""People have a constitutional right to have semiautomatic rifles.""","Meet the Press host Chuck Todd did a double-take after House Speaker Paul Ryan made a claim about semiautomatic rifles, which was the type of gun used in the mass shooting in Orlando days earlier. ""I grew up hunting with Remington 7400s, which are semiautomatic rifles. Cosmetically they look different, they function exactly the same,"" the Wisconsin Republican said on the June 19, 2016 edition of the show. ""So, look, we can go into all of these issues other than to say, people have a constitutional right to bear arms. People have a constitutional right to have semiautomatic rifles."" Todd then interrupted Ryan, saying: ""There’s nothing in the Second Amendment that says you have a right for a semiautomatic. You can regulate."" Ryan agreed that the government can put restrictions on guns. But what about his statement? Do Americans have a constitutional right to have semiautomatic rifles? Five experts we consulted agreed that Ryan was generally on target -- though, as University of Texas law professor Stephen Vladeck put it, ""there’s a ton of nuance behind"" his statement. 2008 case key Automatic rifles, which fire continuously when the trigger is pressed, are essentially banned by federal law. Semiautomatics -- which reload automatically but fire only once each time the trigger is depressed -- are not banned, though some states do impose restrictions on them. To check Ryan’s claim, we spoke with four law professors who are experts on gun law: Vladeck; Nicholas Johnson of Fordham University; Robert Spitzer of State University of New York-Cortland; and Adam Winkler at UCLA in Los Angeles. We also spoke to Adam Bates, a criminal justice policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute. The Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution -- ""the right of the people to keep and bear arms"" -- was passed by Congress in 1789 and ratified two years later. So, it does not, of course, explicitly declare a right to have a semiautomatic rifle, a version of which wasn’t invented until about a century later. The U.S. Supreme Court also has not explicitly declared a constitutional right to semiautomatic rifles. But semiautomatic rifles, as Ryan suggested with his reference to a hunting rifle, have been widely owned and commonly used for generations. The courts have allowed states to put restrictions on such rifles, but they have long been a legal firearm. All of the experts cited a 2008 U.S. Supreme Court decision in what is known as the Heller case, the high court’s first decision interpreting the Second Amendment since 1939. In a 5-4 ruling, the court said the Second Amendment confers an individual right to possess a firearm for traditionally lawful purposes such as self-defense. Key excerpts of the decision, which was written by the late Justice Antonin Scalia: The Second Amendment protects an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia, and to use that arm for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home ....  it connotes an individual right to keep and bear arms.  Like most rights, the Second Amendment right is not unlimited. It is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose. Heller was a handgun case. But each of the experts told us that the decision has been read to includes semiautomatic rifles as being among guns protected by the Second Amendment -- and that any attempt to ban them (not restrict them) would very likely be ruled unconstitutional. Our rating Ryan said: ""People have a constitutional right to have semiautomatic rifles."" The U.S. Supreme Court decision has not explicitly declared that Americans have a constitutional right to semiautomatic rifles. And states can, within certain parameters, put restrictions on those guns. But generally speaking, experts told us, semiautomatic rifles are a legal weapon that fall under the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms",Mostly True,"June 24, 2016"
"The ammunition used in the Orlando shooting ""is banned by Geneva Convention. It enters the body, spins & explodes.""","Filmmaker and liberal commentator Michael Moore made a provocative claim about the ammunition used in the June 12 Orlando shooting — that it is prohibited by the Geneva Conventions. ""Ammo used in AR-15/M-16 is banned by Geneva Convention,"" Moore tweeted June 14. ""It enters the body, spins & explodes. Show the crime scene photos and the NRA is over.""   The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives reported June 12 that Omar Mateen had been in possession of a 9 millimeter semiautomatic pistol and a .223 caliber AR-type rifle. The latter was later identified as a Sig Sauer MCX rifle by the gun shop owner who sold Mateen the gun. Law enforcement has not released the exact type of .223-caliber ammunition used as of this fact-check’s publication. Still, many people responded on Twitter to Moore trying to debunk his tweet, so we took a closer look. We contacted Moore's office but didn't hear back.  What is the Geneva Convention? The 1949 Geneva Conventions are a set of treaties and protocols dictating the humane treatment of people during war. For example, they prohibit torture, hostage-taking, deportation and execution without ""judicial guarantees."" In particular, the Conventions prescribe protections for various classes — the ill, medical workers, prisoners of war and civilians during wartime. The main text of the Geneva Convention treaties does not include any specific mention of prohibited ammunition, and neither do the supplementary protocols. The closest thing to Moore’s claim is Article 35 of the first protocol. It prohibits ""weapons, projectiles and materials … causing superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering"" but does not offer further clarification. In any case, the Geneva Convention does not apply to domestic weapon use, said Dan Joyner, a professor of law at the University of Alabama. Only wartime. ""No source of international law prohibits the sale or use within a country of any particular kind of ammunition,"" Joyner said. Mateen’s declaration of allegiance to ISIS does give the incident an international character, but the Conventions primarily apply to issues between nation-factions. Different conventions We looked at other international conventions to see if they banned certain ammunition. Some do, but experts suggested Mateen’s ammunition might not qualify, again because these agreements are binding for traditional warfare, not domestic purchases. The first appearance of an ammunition ban in international treaties comes in the 1868 Declaration of St. Petersburg, which bans explosive or flammable projectiles weighing less than 400 grams. Declaration III of the 1899 Hague Convention bans bullets that ""expand or flatten"" upon entering the body — commonly known as ""hollow-point bullets."" The same language is included in the 1998 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. The catch? Hague only applies ""in the case of war"" between two or more signatories. Rome only creates jurisdiction over genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. Case in point, the International Committee of the Red Cross notes that many parties to the Hague Convention use ""expanding bullets"" in their domestic police forces. Gary Mauser, professor emeritus at Simon Fraser University, said Moore’s claim errs in relating the Orlando shooting to the Convention. ""That ban does not apply to the attacker in Orlando since he was not part of a formal military force,"" Mauser said. In its newly set International Small Arms Control Standards, the United Nations has recently included a ban on a narrowly defined type of armor-piercing ammunition. However, these protocols are only guidance for how countries could choose to behave domestically, Mauser said. ""ISACS recommendations are merely recommendations, and do not have the force of law, either internationally or within any nation,"" said Mauser, who is also an ISACS expert advisor. The bullets Experts are unsure whether Mateen’s ammunition matches what the treaties describe anyway, as law enforcement officials have not yet released the exact type of bullet Mateen used. George Mocsary, a professor of law at Southern Illinois University, said that the vast majority of AR-15 bullets (mentioned in Moore’s tweet) are .223 ""full metal jackets."" These, Mocsary said, would not violate any conventions because they are ""not expanding,"" ""not explosive,"" and ""not armour-piercing by the ISACS definition."" Mocsary did, however, note that many .223 rounds can penetrate some armour simply by nature of being shot from a rifle. However, investigators have not confirmed whether ""full metal jackets"" were in fact what Mateen used. Tim O’Rourke, an investigator for The Grafton Group forensic science firm, said it is impossible to definitively characterize Mateen’s rounds without further information. It is possible and legal to purchase hollow-point ""controlled expansion"" rounds in Florida, he said. Regarding what Moore tweeted about the bullets’ ""spin,"" O’Rourke noted it is possible for bullets to ""tumble"" in the body depending on contingent factors such as barrel length and distance fired. O’Rourke noted, however, that the bullets would not be designed to explode or detonate in the body. Nonetheless, doctors treating the injuries noted the severe damage done to victim’s bodies, such as ""big, giant cavities"" in the victims. One mentioned that bullets struck with such force that ripple effects damaged even nearby tissue. ""It actually puts kinetic energy into tissue that it didn't hit,"" said doctor John M. Porter in the Philadelphia Inquirer. ""It can go next to the liver and still destroy the liver."" Our ruling Moore tweeted that the Geneva Convention prohibits the type of ammunition used in the Orlando shooting. However, the Geneva Convention does not deal with ammunition. Other international conventions do prohibit certain ammunition, but only during wartime, not domestically. Even if they were binding domestically, experts are not sure whether Mateen’s bullets qualify, given the limited information released from law enforcement. That being said, Moore’s tweet does emphasize the amount of damage these bullets inflicted. Even if his specifics might be off, doctors’ reports support Moore on the general point about damages",False,"June 23, 2016"
"""Al-Qaida operatives, have said, 'Hey, we want you to use this loophole (for purchasing guns despite being on a watch list) to attack and kill Americans.'""","New Jersey Democrat Cory Booker was one of the U.S. senators who spent nearly 15 hours in an overnight filibuster designed to pressure Congress to vote on two gun amendments proposed in response to the mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla.

Both were rejected in a largely party-line vote June 20, 2016. Ahead of the vote, MSNBC's Chris Matthews asked Booker in a June 16 interview how the filibuster would ""lead to an actual bill, something the president can sign?""

For this fact-check, we decided to look into whether al-Qaida propaganda has actually been urging people to exploit that situation. When we contacted Booker's office, a spokesman responded immediately with several links, all pointing to a 2011 video made by Adam Gadahn, an American serving as a spokesman for al-Qaida. ""Muslims in the west have to remember they are perfectly placed to play an important and decisive part in the jihad against the Zionists and crusaders, and to do major damage to the enemies of Islam, waging war on their religion, sacred places, and things and brethren. This is a golden opportunity"" to rush to do battle with everything at your disposal, he says. ""And in the West, you've got a lot at your disposal. Let’s take America as an example,"" Gadahn said. ""America is absolutely awash with easily obtainable firearms. You can go down to a gun show at the local convention center and come away with a fully automatic assault rifle, without a background check, and most likely without having to show an identification card. So what are you waiting for?"" (Gadahn's information was not entirely correct. As CNN noted, only specially licensed dealers can sell fully automatic weapons and they require a background check.) Gadahn, the first American charged with treason since World War II and an occupant of the FBI's list of most-wanted terrorists, was killed by the United States in January 2015 counterterrorism operation. Max Abrahms, an assistant professor of political science at Northeastern University, said he couldn't recall ""any other videos as explicit about the ease of using guns in the United States on Islamists' behalf. That said, I would be surprised if there isn't other propaganda seeking to exploit the permissiveness of gun access in the U.S."" Our ruling Booker said, ""Al-Qaida operatives, have said, 'Hey, we want you to use this loophole (for purchasing guns despite being on a watch list) to attack and kill Americans.""

Both the National Rifle Association and Everytown for Gun Safety are dumping millions of dollars into the state in the battle over Question 1. Veteran state Republican operative Robert Uithoven is leading efforts to defeat the measure, and recently criticized the initiative on a public-affairs television program and warned that passing the measure would make Nevada gun laws even more restrictive than its more liberal neighbor — California. ""If Question 1 were to pass here in Nevada, we would have more restrictive gun laws here in Nevada dealing with the transfer of firearms than they do in California,"" he said in a June 6 interview on Nevada NewsMakers. The California/Nevada comparison is becoming a more popular talking point among opponents of the ballot measure, but would Question 1 actually make Nevada stricter than California on gun transfers? The answer isn’t so clear. What’s at stake? So what would Nevada’s proposed background check expansion actually mean for gun owners? If approved by voters, the initiative would create an escalating penalty (starting with a misdemeanor) for people without a license to sell firearms to sell or transfer guns without first going to a licensed dealer and having them conduct a background check. That would be a departure from current state law, where background checks are generally not required for gun sales or transfers between two private parties (lawmakers approved a change waiving fees for voluntary background checks in 2015). Republican Gov. Brian Sandoval vetoed a bill in 2013 that would have enacted a similar background check process on private gun sales and transfers, saying it would impose ""unreasonable burdens and harsh penalties"" on otherwise law-abiding gun owners. If approved, licensed firearm dealers would be required to conduct the background checks, which is done under the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) and is generally completed fairly quickly (though delays can last up to three days). There are some exceptions built in to the ballot question, including sales and transfers between family members and for antique guns. Temporary transfers without background checks would be allowed in some specific cases, like on certified shooting ranges, in areas where it’s legal to hunt or while in the presence of the gun owner. Debate over the ballot measure echoes the national debate over gun control. Supporters say the majority of background checks are completed quickly and the measure closes an existing loophole, while opponents lambast the measure for being overly vague and unduly burdensome on gun owners. Transfers and Exemptions Approval of Question 1 would turn private party gun sales and transfers in Nevada into a process that would more closely resemble California’s existing system, but there are some differences that would persist between the two states especially in the area of temporary gun transfers, or loans. Uithoven told PolitiFact that California generally allows people ""who are personally known to each other"" to infrequently loan firearms for up to 30 days as long as the recipient has a valid firearm safety certificate and the loan is for a ""lawful purpose."" California also has exemptions for transfers as gifts, on gun ranges, for use as props in the entertainment industry, loans to minors under certain requirements and for licensed hunters during hunting season(though California lawmakers are debating rolling back several of the exemptions including the 30-day infrequent loans). Because the Nevada ballot measure don’t allow for a ""temporary"" transfer, or loan, between friends unless the gun owner is in the physical presence of the person handling the gun or under a several clearly stated, well-defined situations (like on a shooting range or legal hunting area), Uithoven says the new law would be stricter than what California requires. The ballot measure does have a broader definition of ""immediate family member,"" as California only includes transfers between parents, children, and grandparents as exempt from transfer regulations. Question 1 broadens those family exemptions in Nevada and includes ""parents, children, siblings, grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces and nephews."" So California is stricter on which family members fall under the inter-family gun transfers label, but as Uithoven points out, the state does have an easier process for ""infrequent"" firearms loans (less than six times per calendar year) to people who are ""personally known to each other,"" which could include friends or other family members. But those ""infrequent transfers"" still require firearm transferees to have completed the state’s Firearm Safety Certificate course, which is a $25 written test on firearm safety and general gun laws. That’s a regulatory hurdle that doesn’t exist in Nevada, with or without the ballot measure. As for any other non-familial transfers that don’t fall under exemptions, California is generally stricter than a post-Question 1 Nevada. So-called ""private party transfers"" in California require a proof-of-residency requirement, a safe handling demonstration requirement and a mandatory ten-day waiting period, whereas the Nevada proposal would only require passing a background check. Uithoven also says that the ballot measure allows licensed firearms dealers to ask for an undefined ""reasonable fee"" to conduct the background check, while California has a set dollar amount written into the state’s penal code. We also reached out to the pro-Question 1 Background Checks Initiative, who highlighted a handful of California regulations that Nevada would lack. California also has an ""assault weapons"" ban, which includes a ban on private sales or transfers of so-called assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. Nevada has no such ban. The state has several additional regulations on private party gun sales compared to the proposed Nevada changes, but not all of them directly relate to firearm transfer rules. California generally requires a 10-day waiting period for any gun sale or transfer, including private party sales and transfers (though it’s being challenged in court). Again, this regulation doesn’t apply to the exempted transfers. California also prohibits buyers from purchasing more than one handgun in a 30-day period, but that’s only for retail sales — private party transfers are exempt. Our ruling NRA Nevadans for Freedom campaign manager Robert Uithoven said passing Question 1 would lead to ""more restrictive gun laws here in Nevada dealing with the transfer of firearms than they do in California."" Passing the ballot question would make Nevada look a lot more like California in terms of private party gun sales and transfers, with generally fewer regulations. Uithoven’s claim focuses specifically in on the process of firearm transfers. In some ways, Nevada’s law would be tougher, but in other ways it would not. Overall, California would have more regulations on firearm transfers if Question 1 passes but would be more lenient in exempting certain types of gun transfers. Uithoven’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important context",Half True,"June 22, 2016"
"Says Kelly Ayotte ""voted again yesterday against a proposal to expand background checks -- (buyers) can continue to simply go online or to gun shows to purchase guns without background checks.""","In the wake of a mass shooting in Orlando, lawmakers in Washington have refocused their efforts on federal gun laws. But on Monday the U.S. Senate shot down a number of firearm bills, designed to expand or strengthen background checks and prevent sales to people on terror watchlists. And now the issue is becoming a central line of attack against Republican U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte, who is seeking re-election in one of the most competitive races this year. The New Hampshire Democratic Party took the first swing, followed by Gov. Maggie Hassan, who is running for Ayotte’s senate seat. ""Ayotte voted again yesterday against a proposal to expand background checks -- meaning dangerous individuals, including suspected terrorists, can continue to simply go online or to gun shows to purchase guns without background checks,"" Hassan’s campaign said in an email on Tuesday, June 21, 2016.   We decided to take a look at Ayotte’s votes and see if she voted against expanded background checks, as Hassan said. The U.S. Senate took four votes June 20 on a variety of firearm proposals, all of which failed to earn the necessary 60 votes to progress. Hassan’s campaign pointed us to an amendment sponsored by U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat. Current law requires background checks only for purchases from federally licensed gun dealers. Murphy’s proposal would have expanded the checks to include sales at gun shows, over the internet and those between friends and family members. Ayotte joined Republican colleagues on a mostly partisan vote to defeat the measure 44-56, well short of the 60 votes needed to advance. ""The Murphy legislation is very broad ... and I think that there are concerns about it,"" Ayotte said Monday, according to The Hill. ""I’ve previously said that I think it’s important to fix the current system."" Ayotte voted against a similar background check amendment in 2013, sponsored by Sens. Joe Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat, and Pat Toomey, a Pennsylvania Republican, which would have expanded background checks to cover gun shows and internet sales.   Back then, Ayotte instead supported an amendment by Republican Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa, which would have increased the mental health records given to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System and provided money for prosecuting background check violations. But it did not expand background checks to cover firearms sales at gun shows or over the Internet. It failed 52-48. On Monday, Grassley introduced a similar amendment, and Ayotte supported it, again. Like the amendment from three years earlier, it would have increased money for the background check system and further defined what it means to be ""mentally competent"" to buy a firearm, but did not expand background checks to cover any new firearms sales, including gun shows and internet sales. It resulted in a familiar outcome as three years ago: It failed 53-47. For the most part, Democrats favored the Murphy amendment, while Republicans supported Grassley.   Ayotte backed the Grassley amendment because she said it improves on the current system. Ayotte’s campaign spokeswoman said Hassan’s claim is misleading. ""The Murphy amendment, which was opposed by one of the Senate’s top Democrats, is a broad expansion of a flawed system, and does not require law enforcement notification when an individual who was on the terrorist watchlist in the past five years attempts to buy a firearm,"" spokeswoman Liz Johnson said in a statement. Ayotte did vote for two competing proposals Monday that sought to block the sale of firearms to suspected terrorists. One, proposed by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat, would let the attorney general stop anyone on the federal terrorist watch lists from buying a gun, according to the Washington Post. Another, put forward by Republican Sen. John Cornyn, would let the government delay a sale to known or suspected terrorists for 72 hours while it investigated. Neither proposal passed, failing to win the needed 60 votes. Ayotte had previously voted against the Feinstein amendment, but voted Monday in support. Our ruling Maggie Hassan said Kelly Ayotte ""voted again yesterday against a proposal to expand background checks -- (buyers) can continue to simply go online or to gun shows to purchase guns without background checks."" In 2013, Ayotte voted against the bi-partisan Manchin-Toomey amendment that sought to expand checks for firearms purchased online and at gun shows. On June 20, Ayotte voted against a Democrat-sponsored amendment that similarly sought to expand background checks. Both times, Ayotte instead voted for a different amendment that would have strengthened the current system, but did not expand background checks to cover firearms sales at gun shows or over the Internet, two things cited by Hassan",True,"June 21, 2016"
"""Assault rifles already are banned.""","The day after a man with a semiautomatic rifle killed 49 people and wounded 53 others at a gay nightclub, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton renewed her call for a federal ban on assault weapons. On the same day, June 13, 2016, Wisconsin Republican Ron Johnson responded to an interviewer’s question about the Orlando incident by stating: ""Assault rifles already are banned."" So, are they prohibited in the United States, or not? It depends on what assault means. But Johnson, who is chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, is off-target in suggesting there is a blanket ban on assault rifles. Johnson’s claim Johnson was interviewed by Charlie Sykes, a conservative talk show host on WTMJ-AM in Milwaukee, who asked: ""Should we be more concerned with the possible violation of Omar Mateen's Second Amendment rights, as opposed to the constitutional rights of the 50 people who are now dead?"" Mateen, who was shot dead in the club by police after the rampage, had been armed with a Sig Sauer MCX semiautomatic rifle and a 9mm handgun. (Orlando police officials initially said Mateen used an ""AR-15-type assault rifle."" Both an AR-15 and the Sig MCX can fire the same type of ammunition at roughly the same speeds, are aesthetically similar and equally lethal, according to the Washington Post. The manufacturer describes the Sig MCX as ""the first true mission-adaptable weapon system."") Johnson answered Sykes’ question by saying: ""That's that delicate balance, Charlie. And that's what we need to have an honest and legitimate conversation about, as opposed to leaping to conclusions. ""To say things like we've got to ban assault rifles. Well, assault rifles already are banned. OK? So, we need to actually have an honest discussion about these issues and understand that this is very difficult, very complex."" One thing to understand up front is the difference between automatic and semiautomatic weapons. Automatic weapons -- banned Automatic weapons -- sometimes known as fully automatic, or machine guns -- fire continuously when the trigger is held down. Two federal laws have essentially banned them in the United States. One law in 1935 all but banned automatic weapons like the Tommy gun. And another in 1986 prohibited fully automatic weapons, except for pre-existing weapons that were grandfathered in. Semiautomatic weapons -- not banned Semiautomatic weapons, like the rifle Mateen carried, reload automatically but fire only once each time the trigger is depressed. They are not banned by federal law. From 1994 to 2004, there was a federal law that banned the sale of certain types of new semiautomatic weapons, including some types of AR-15 rifles. A limit on high-capacity magazines also was set. The law, which was adopted to last for 10 years, was not renewed by Congress when it expired. The takeaway Johnson takes the position that only automatic weapons qualify as assault weapons. It’s worth noting that in at least one other interview the same day — with conservative Green Bay radio talk show host Jerry Bader — he spelled that out, saying ""an assault weapon is a fully automatic.""  His office made the same argument to us, citing technical military definitions. However, that’s not a generally accepted line of separation. The federal law that became defunct in 2004 was called the Federal Assault Weapons Ban, and at the time the Department of Justice defined some semiautomatic guns as assault weapons. A number of state laws still have that wording on their books. And law enforcement agencies consider certain semiautomatic weapons, including the one used by Mateen, as assault weapons — or at minimum, assault-style weapons. Indeed, the weapons used in the mass shootings in San Bernardino, Calif., Aurora, Colo. and Newtown, Conn. -- all of which were semiautomatic -- were all described by police as assault rifles. Our rating In the wake of the mass shooting in Orlando, in which the killer used a semiautomatic rifle was used, Johnson stated: ""Assault rifles already are banned."" Some, including Johnson, contend that only weapons that are automatic — firing continuously when the trigger is held down are assault weapons — are assault weapons. Those are essentially prohibited by federal laws. But that definition is narrow, and Johnson’s claim gives a misleading impression of a comprehensive ban. Lawmakers, law enforcement officials and others widely refer to many semiautomatic weapons like the rifle used in Orlando and other mass shootings — which reload automatically but fire only once each time the trigger is depressed — as assault weapons. Those are not banned by federal law",Mostly False,"June 20, 2016"
"Last year, ""244 suspected terrorists walked into gun shops and attempted to purchase a firearm; 223 were able to get the firearm.""","The mass shooting in Orlando, Fla., June 12 reopened the debate over who should access to guns, with Democrats calling for stricter controls. During a June 14 news conference in Washington, Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said most people suspected of terrorism in the United States haven't haven't found it difficult to purchase a weapon. ""Last year, 244 people on the terror watch list tried to purchase guns; 244 suspected terrorists walked into gun shops and attempted to purchase a firearm; 223 were able to get the firearm. Only 21 went empty-handed,"" Schumer said. ""Ninety-one percent of suspected terrorists, when they sought to purchase a gun, last year were successful, according to GAO."" The GAO is the U.S. Government Accountability Office. First, some background on these ""suspected terrorists."" The FBI's Terrorist Screening Center maintains a list of people ""known or reasonably suspected of being involved in terrorist activity."" This list is secret but it's believed to have around 700,000 names collected by U.S. and global agencies. It's estimated that 10,000 of those names are Americans and the rest are foreigners. We looked at this issue in December when we examined U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy's tweet that ""91 percent of suspected terrorists who attempted to buy guns in America walked away with the weapon they wanted."" We rated Murphy's statement Mostly True. (Murphy, who is running in Florida's Democratic primary for U.S. Senate in 2016, issued the tweet after Republicans repeatedly blocked a bill that would keep people on the FBI list from buying guns.) Murphy was referencing a GAO report from March 2015. But Schumer's statement focused on the entire year of 2015. So we found the updated report. Issued March 7, 2016, it found — as Schumer reported — that only 21 of the 244 transactions attempted by people on the terrorist watch list at a licensed firearms shop were blocked. In 223 cases, the customers got their weapons. But there are important omissions in these numbers. So we don't know that 244 people on the list attempted to buy guns. We know that people on the list attempted to buy guns 244 times.  On the flip side, the number of people on the watch list who legally purchased weapons may be far higher because the tally doesn't include transactions made at gun shows, where federal background checks aren’t conducted. Finally, there have been questions about the accuracy of the watchlist itself. A 2009 U.S. Justice Department audit showed that 35 percent of the people on the list were ""associated with FBI cases that did not contain current international terrorist or domestic terrorism designations"" and should have been removed from the list. There also are multiple entries for slight variations of the same name, which means people with the same name as a person on the watch list were stopped at airports, a problem that experts say has largely been resolved. Our ruling Schumer said that in 2015, ""244 suspected terrorists walked into gun shops and attempted to purchase a firearm; 223 were able to get the firearm"" according to the GAO report. He correctly notes that this is gun shop data from the GAO, but he is wrong to suggest that the report is a tally of the number of suspected terrorists trying to make a firearm purchase. As the report makes clear, it's the number of attempted transactions, some of which might have been done by the same individual",Mostly True,"June 15, 2016"
"""He leant his name to a bill, did little or nothing three years ago to try to get it passed, (and) since then has done absolutely nothing other than disavow any attempt to move on the legislation.""","Republican Sen. Pat Toomey won praise from Democrats (yes, you read that right) in 2013 when he put his name on a bill that would have expanded background checks after 26 people, including 20 children, were gunned down at Sandy Hook Elementary School. The bill would have required a background check on all gun sales, including at gun shows and on the Internet with an exemption for sales between family and friends. But despite support from Toomey, the conservative from Pennsylvania, the bill narrowly failed the Senate in April 2013 as families from Newtown, Conn. looked on. Now, Toomey’s up for re-election and his Democratic opponent is hammering him on gun safety legislation after the weekend massacre in Orlando, the largest mass shooting in American history. Katie McGinty has slammed Toomey on his record and implied over the last two days that his support of expanding background checks in 2013 was hollow. ""He leant his name to a bill, did little or nothing three years ago to try to get it passed, (and) since then has done absolutely nothing other than disavow any attempt to move on the legislation,"" she told The Inquirer in a story published Monday. Toomey’s name was on the bill that was pushed three years ago to expand background checks -- it was literally known as the Toomey-Manchin amendment -- yet he hasn’t committed to re-introducing since it failed. But ""disavow"" is a pretty strong word. And it didn’t appear he had out-right denied support for it. So we decided to check the claim. Toomey signs on Following the mass shooting at Sandy Hook, Sen. Joe Manchin, D- W. Va., began drafting legislation that would strengthen background checks and began searching for a Republican to co-sponsor his amendment to the larger Safe Communities, Safe Schools Act of 2013. Manchin began working with Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Wy., but his involvement fizzled out by March 2013. Manchin’s next partner for the legislation? Pat Toomey, who was also getting pressure from a political ad circulating in Pennsylvania that was run by Mayors Against Illegal Guns urging him to support gun control legislation. By the end of March, Toomey was on board and an official announcement was made shortly later. He and Manchin made media appearances and held meetings with senators on both sides of the aisle. A spokeswoman from Everytown, a national gun violence prevention group, said her organization at the time worked directly with Toomey on the legislation. He also appeared with Manchin on the Senate floor to push for its passage and, after his approval, enough Republicans voted to make it essentially filibuster-proof, a move Democrats rallied around. Other Republicans, not so much. ""While all of us like and respect Sen. Toomey,"" Senate Minority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas, told The Hill at the time, ""there wasn’t an outpouring of support for his amendment."" Toomey’s name was on the bill for about two weeks before it was brought up for a vote, when it was ultimately defeated 54-46. Five Democrats opposed the bill, but the following four Republicans voted in favor: Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, Sen. Mark Kirk of Illinois, John McCain of Arizona and Toomey. The three Republicans besides Toomey who voted in favor of the amendment? They all had previously expressed support for expanding background checks on gun sales before Toomey’s involvement. What did he accomplish? McGinty’s campaign argues Toomey accomplished little with regard to moving the background checks legislation forward and, since it failed in 2013, hasn’t re-introduced it. After it was struck down in the Senate, he told Politico ""it’s time to move on."" The amendment was brought up again by Manchin in 2015, and Toomey didn’t speak out in favor of passing it, though he did vote for it. It was again defeated. ""Since the bill expired at the end of 2013, Senator Toomey has had a full year and a half to copy and paste the language from his 2013 bill and simply re-introduce it. He just hasn't done it,"" McGinty’s spokesman Sean Coit said. ""On top of that, he's made it very clear... that he's not interested in the bill anymore and is done working to address gun violence."" So does Toomey still support legislation that would expand background checks though he hasn’t reintroduced his own amendment? Or, as McGinty says, has he ""disavow[ed] any attempt to move on the legislation?"" His Senate office wouldn’t commit to re-introducing the bill -- and The (Allentown) Morning Call reported a gun rights group said Toomey’s office told them last year that it wouldn’t be brought up again. His office disputed that account and spokeswoman E.R. Anderson said this week that Toomey ""continues to strongly support this measure, as well as others, to make it harder for terrorists, criminals, and mentally ill people to obtain guns."" Toomey’s campaign for re-election says the senator was heavily praised following his support of the amendment, including being formally honored by Sandy Hook families at a ceremony last year. ""There are few senators who have done more than Pat Toomey to reach across the aisle and attempt to forge a real bipartisan consensus on critical gun safety legislation,"" spokesman Ted Kwong said in a statement. Democrats take issue with that statement, pointing out that Toomey has rarely brought up the legislation on the Senate floor since it was defeated in 2013 and that he was critical this year of President Obama using executive orders to tighten gun regulations. McGinty again hit Toomey during a press conference Tuesday on gun safety, calling on him to pass legislation that would make it harder for suspected terrorists to buy guns. Last year, Toomey voted against a measure that would have made it illegal for those on the no-fly list to buy guns and instead favored a GOP bill that would have allowed the attorney general to stop a suspected terrorist from buying a gun, but the attorney general would have to do so within 72 hours unless the courts stepped in. Toomey’s contended the Republican bill that was voted on and defeated was a viable option; McGinty this week called it ""toothless."" Our ruling This claim was two-fold, with McGinty claiming 1. That Toomey ""did little or nothing"" to attempt to get the Toomey-Manchin amendment passed and 2. That he has ""done absolutely nothing other than disavow any attempt to move on the legislation"" after it was shot down by the Senate. Toomey signed onto the amendment very late in the game and a vote took place just weeks after his name was added to it. It’s also true that no additional Republicans signed on to vote in favor of the legislation after Toomey added in his support. If McGinty would have said Toomey accomplished little, she would have been right. But to say he ""did little or nothing"" to advance the bill isn’t supported by the facts. The senator also hasn’t re-introduced the legislation since it was shot down and hasn’t indicated that he plans to. But the definition of ""disavow"" is to deny complete responsibility for, and Toomey isn’t against the legislation itself, saying he still supports the measure -- and indeed, he voted for it again. For now, he just won’t be the one to re-introduce it",Mostly False,"June 15, 2016"
"""More than 32,000 Americans lose their lives to gun violence each year."""," Calls to strengthen California’s gun laws intensified this week after the nation’s deadliest mass shooting in history at an Orlando nightclub. State lawmakers described the tragedy as a call to action to strengthen California’s firearm regulations, considered among the toughest in America. In November, voters in the state will likely be asked to make those laws even tougher, by approving the Safety For All Initiative. That measure is led by Democratic Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom and is pending signature verification. On the initiative’s website, it claims: ""More than 32,000 Americans lose their lives to gun violence each year."" The statement is followed by the message: ""Gun Violence Is Not Inevitable. The Power To Save Lives Is In Our Hands: Together We Can Keep Our Communities Safe."" We wondered about the eye-popping 32,000 figure and whether any context was missing.  A screenshot of SafetyForAll.com's homepage shows the claim about 32,000 Americans losing their lives to gun violence each year. Our research Much of the Safety For All Initiative is designed to make it more difficult for individuals to obtain ammunition for assault-style weapons, such as those used in recent mass shootings in San Bernardino and Orlando. Here’s what the measure would do, if approved by voters: Require instant background checks for ammunition purchases; strengthen checks for gun purchases and ban the possession of large, detachable military-style magazines; and require the immediate surrender of firearms for people convicted of serious and violent crimes. A spokeswoman for the initiative pointed us to figures from the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention. They show nearly 33,000 gun deaths, on average, from 2010 through 2014 in the United States. Of those, more than 62 percent resulted from suicides by guns -- something not mentioned on the Safety For All website. There’s no mention of suicide by guns or suicide prevention efforts in the text of the measure, either. About 34 percent of the gun deaths are from homicides. The remaining four percent resulted from accidents, legal intervention or cases where intent was undetermined. We asked the initiative campaign about the large share of gun deaths from suicide. Dan Newman, a campaign strategist for the lieutenant governor, replied that ""treating ammo sales like guns and screening for dangerous mental illness, taking guns away from people legally prohibited from owning weapons, reporting lost and stolen guns and ammo – these will all reduce gun violence of all kinds, from suicide to mass murder."" In October 2015, PolitiFact Texas checked a similar claim by Hillary Clinton, that ""We lose an average of 90 Americans every day because of guns."" That adds up to the CDC total of more than 32,000. They rated it Mostly True. PolitiFact Texas pointed out that at least once, Clinton has clarified her figure by mentioning suicides; according to a post on her campaign website, she said: ""We lose between 88 and 92 Americans a day from gun violence — homicides, suicides and accidents — and we have to act."" Our ruling The Safety For All Initiative proposes stronger gun and ammunition restrictions in California. On its website, it says ""More than 32,000 Americans lose their lives to gun violence each year."" That sad statistic checks out, based on an examination of data from the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention. While the statement is accurate, it needs a key clarification that more than 60 percent of those gun deaths result from suicides.   Much of the Safety For All Initiative is designed to make it more difficult for individuals to obtain ammunition for assault-style weapons, not typically associated with suicides",Mostly True,"June 14, 2016"
"The rifle used by Omar Mateen ""shoots off 700 rounds in a minute.""","Rep. Alan Grayson, an Orlando-area Democrat, made a case against assault rifles after the shooting in Orlando, arguing that the gun’s rate of fire is what made the death toll so catastrophic. If the shooter, Omar Mateen, ""was not able to buy a weapon that shoots off 700 rounds in a minute, a lot of those people would still be alive,"" Grayson said June 12, in an interview with CNN’s Erin Burnett. ""If somebody like him had nothing worse to deal with than a glock pistol which was his other weapon today, he might have killed three or four people and not 50,"" Grayson said. Law enforcement officials have not released specific details regarding the nature of the rifle Mateen used in the shooting as of this fact-check. Law enforcement officials have described it as an ""AR type rifle."" The gun shop owner who sold Mateen the weapon told the New York Post it was a Sig Sauer MCX rifle.   Grayson told PolitiFact he was referring to the AR-15 weapon more generally, which was modeled off the military style M16. All these details matter, and what makes Grayson's claim problematic. Experts told us the weapon Mateen used could not fire 700 rounds in a minute without serious alterations that require the resources of a gun manufacturer. Even if Mateen had those resources, and there is no indication from sounds recorded from the shooting or from investigators that he did, experts are not even sure if Grayson’s 700-rounds-per-minute claim is possible. Experts said that firing 700 rounds per minute is unrealistic due to the time it would take for a shooter to reload magazines and because the gun would overheat. What Grayson said later Both the AR-15 and Sig Sauer MCX rifle are sold for civilian use as a semiautomatic rifle, meaning a shooter has to pull the trigger to fire each round. This is different from an automatic weapon where the shooter can hold down the trigger and shoot multiple rounds. The AR-15 weapon was used in the 2015 San Bernadino and 2012 Sandy Hook shootings, and has since been the subject of controversy, including a lawsuit against an AR-15 manufacturer. Mateen used an ""AR type rifle,"" according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Some people, like Grayson, took that to mean an AR-15. The Sig Sauer MCX, however, looks like an AR-15 and is considered an AR type rifle.  Grayson clarified his specific claim in other interviews to say that rifle Mateen used was only capable of 700 rounds per minute when modified to become an automatic weapon, such as the M16 military version of the civilian AR-15. Grayson told PolitiFact that there are various ways of converting weapons from semi-automatic to automatic, some legal (purchasing a shoulder mount) and others illegal (""machining"" the weapon). Gary Kleck, Florida State University criminologist, said that it would be possible to ""convert"" a semiautomatic rifle into an automatic rifle, but only ""if you had the resources of a modern rifle manufacturer"" and sufficient tools. Kleck’s research on guns recovered by police suggests that rarely happens. If shooters do use an automatic weapon, they probably stole it from a military armory rather than repurposing a civilian version, Kleck said. Theory vs. reality Grayson’s claim distorts what we know about the Orlando shooting and the number of rounds a standard semiautomatic rifle can fire. The 700-round-a-minute figure is only a theoretical benchmark, not something achievable in reality. Army documents list the M16 as having a ""cyclic rate of fire"" of 700-900 rounds per minute. However, the ""cyclic"" rate of fire is a theoretical measurement of speed, not how many rounds could actually be shot out of the gun in 1 minute, said Michael O’Shea, a constitutional law professor at Oklahoma City University. ""That only means how rapidly the firing mechanism operates while there is ammunition in the gun,"" O’Shea said. ""It is not the same as being able to actually discharge 700 rounds of ammunition from the gun in 60 seconds."" For starters, a shooter would have to reload his magazines to achieve that volume — at least 20 times with 30 round magazines or 6 times with 100 round magazines, which are less commonly used, O’Shea said. Grayson told PolitiFact that there are videos online of people shooting at 700-900 rounds per minute. However, we searched online for such videos and found that they actually confirmed O'Shea's point.  The Army document designates the ""maximum effective rate of fire"" — ""the highest rate of fire that can be maintained and still achieve target hits"" — as 150-200 rounds per minute for an automatic M16. Kleck added that, from his research on mass shootings, most shooters rarely fire more than 50 rounds per minute. Even if you could overcome the need to reload — by installing a belt of ammunition — reaching 700 rounds in one minute remains infeasible, said Steven Howard, a lawyer and gun expert who has consulted with various law enforcement agencies. ""In reality, you’ll get to 500 rounds and the gun will just melt,"" Howard said. Our ruling Grayson said that the rifle Mateen used ""shoots off 700 rounds in a minute."" On CNN, he includes this claim without any clarification. In other forums, he noted that his claim is only true for the hypothetical semiautomatic rifle converted to an automatic weapon. Even then, however, experts say the 700-round-per-minute figure is not an accurate portrayal of rounds fired. This is true for many reasons, they said, including reloading time and the potential of overheating the gun. The debate over how assault weapons ought to be regulated is ongoing and contentious, but the claim Grayson uses is nonetheless misleading",Mostly False,"June 14, 2016"
"""Florida doesn't regulate assault weapons or .50 caliber rifles or large-capacity ammunition magazines. It doesn't require a permit to purchase a gun. It doesn't require any registration, whatsoever.""","Hillary Clinton and Democrats are talking about measures to restrict purchases of firearms in some instances after Sunday’s deadly attack at an Orlando nightclub. During an interview on CNN’s New Day, Clinton singled out Florida’s law needs to be changed. As of this writing, 49 people have been declared dead in the shooting rampage. Investigators say the attack was carried out by by 29-year-old Omar Mateen, a U.S. born citizen. ""Florida doesn't regulate assault weapons or .50 caliber rifles or large-capacity ammunition magazines,"" Clinton said. ""It doesn't require a permit to purchase a gun. It doesn't require any registration, whatsoever."" Clinton made several claims about Florida’s law. We'll go through them one by one. Mateen used a .223-caliber assault rifle described as an AR type rifle and a 9mm semi-automatic pistol in the attacks. Both were purchased legally in recent days.  Gun laws in Florida Clinton spokesman Josh Schwerin led us to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence for evidence of this claim, which focuses on providing legal expertise in support of gun laws that reduce the number of gun-related deaths. The website makes the same assertion Clinton made on CNN: Florida doesn’t regulate assault rifles, .50 caliber rifles or large-capacity ammunition magazines, nor does it require the registration of firearms. The definition of assault rifle varies, but it most often describes military-like rifles or semi-automatic rifles that may include detachable magazines. (The AR type weapon Mateen used certainly would qualify.) .50-caliber rifles can shoot from long distances with accuracy (they use wider ammunition) and large-capacity ammunition magazines allow the shooter to fire multiple rounds before having to reload. Mateen did not have a .50-caliber rifle. Clinton is correct that Florida places no additional regulations on owning those types of firearms or accessories.  As far as registration, Florida law prohibits keeping a registry of legally bought firearms. ""A list, record, or registry of legally owned firearms or law-abiding firearm owners is not a law enforcement tool and can become an instrument for profiling, harassing, or abusing law-abiding citizens based on their choice to own a firearm and exercise their Second Amendment …"" chapter 790.355 reads. Florida does require a permit to carry a concealed weapon, but those records are sealed from the public. Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research said that Clinton’s claim is ""true on all fronts."" Gary Kleck, a professor of criminology at Florida State University agreed that Clinton is correctly reciting specific parts of Florida gun law. But Kleck cautioned about singling out Florida. The state, he said, is ""essentially identical to most other states with regard to these kinds of gun controls."" Kleck said that only seven states including Washington D.C. ban some type of assault weapons, while the other 43 regulate them the same as other types of guns. He also said only two other states and Washington D.C. prohibit .50 caliber firearms and eight states ban large capacity magazines. ""For good or ill, (Florida) is squarely in the American mainstream regarding the gun controls that Clinton mentions,"" Kleck said. ""Consequently one cannot legitimately argue (or hint) that this mass shooting was especially likely to occur in Florida because it lacked these controls."" Our ruling Clinton said that Florida’s gun laws don’t regulate assault weapons or .50 caliber rifles or large-capacity ammunition magazines or require a permit or registration to purchase a gun. There’s no denying that Clinton described Florida law correctly. But an expert cautions that Florida law isn’t all that different than many places across the country",Mostly True,"June 13, 2016"
"Says Hillary Clinton ""wants to abolish the Second Amendment.""","Donald Trump accused Hillary Clinton of coming after your guns and your right to them. ""Hillary Clinton wants to abolish the Second Amendment,"" Trump said May 7 at a rally in Washington. ""Hillary Clinton wants to take your guns away, and she wants to abolish the Second Amendment."" We asked the Trump campaign for evidence for this claim, but they didn’t get back to us. The Clinton campaign vehemently denied it. ""Of course Hillary Clinton does not want to repeal the Second Amendment,"" Clinton spokesman Josh Schwerin said. We found no evidence that Clinton has ever advocated for repealing or abolishing the Second Amendment. Schwerin’s comments are largely consistent with what Clinton has said in the past few years about the right to bear arms. However, gun rights advocates argue that it’s reasonable to infer from a few of Clinton’s comments that she wants to roll back the Second Amendment as it’s currently interpreted. Straight shooting on the campaign trail In both her 2008 and 2016 White House bids, Clinton has called for stronger background check requirements all the while affirming her support for the right to bear arms. Clinton does want to keep guns out of the hands of ""people we all agree shouldn't have them — domestic abusers, violent felons, and dangerously mentally ill people,"" said Dan Gross, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Violence. But Trump’s charge exaggerates the controls she wants to put in place and ignores what she has said on the record. ""I believe in the Second Amendment. People have a right to bear arms. But I also believe that we can common-sensically approach this,"" she said in a January 2008 Democratic presidential debate. In response to the on-air murders of a news crew in Virginia in August 2015, she said, ""We are smart enough, compassionate enough to balance legitimate Second Amendment rights concerns with preventive measures and control measures, so whatever motivated this murderer ... we will not see more needless, senseless deaths."" More recently, she tweeted in April 2016,  ""We can protect our Second Amendment rights AND take commonsense steps to prevent gun violence. It’s just a question of whether we choose to."" Setting aside the bulk of Clinton’s comments on protecting the Second Amendment (examples here, here, here, here, here and here), we’ll now go over two points that some gun rights advocates and experts say gives Trump’s charge some credence. Two smoking guns? Clinton riled the gun lobby with two eyebrow-raising comments last fall. Clinton said in October 2015 that a national gun buyback program like Australia’s compulsory program was ""worth looking into."" After a gunman killed 35 people in Port Arthur, Tasmania, in 1996, Australia banned semiautomatic and automatic weapons and enacted a mandatory buyback of the newly prohibited guns. That program is ""incompatible with private ownership of guns,"" said Eugene Volokh, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. Dave Kopel, a pro-gun rights attorney and research director of the conservative Independence Institute in Denver, equates her musing about Australia’s program as ""wanting to abolish the Second Amendment."" (The NRA shares this view.) The full context of Clinton’s response, however, suggests she may have misspoken or not fully understood Australia’s program, as she also evoked voluntary buybacks as potential models for a U.S. program. ""Communities have done that in our country. Several communities have done gun buyback programs. But I think it would be worth considering on the national level if that could be arranged,"" she said, before comparing the buybacks to Cash for Clunkers, the Obama administration’s voluntary vehicle trade-in program. Second, Clinton said she disagrees with the the Supreme Court’s landmark ruling in District of Columbia v. Heller. In a 5-4 decision, the Court struck down Washington’s handgun ban and recognized that the Second Amendment applies to the individual’s right to bear arms. ""The Supreme Court is wrong on the Second Amendment,"" she said in a leaked recording of a private fundraiser. Volokh called the comment ""a smoking gun"" that bolsters Trump’s charge. Reversing Heller, said Kopel, would be a huge blow to the individual right to bear arms  They both pointed out that former Justice Department officials under President Bill Clinton and his appointees Stephen Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg argued in Heller that gun regulations do not violate the Second Amendment because it primarily pertains to a well-regulated militia and not the individual right to bear arms. Put both comments together, and Trump is correct, said NRA spokeswoman Amy Hunter. UCLA Second Amendment expert Adam Winkler, meanwhile, said that the accuracy of Trump’s charge depends on Clinton’s grounds for rejecting Heller. (According to news reports from the 2008 election, she supported Washington’s handgun ban.) ""If she thought the reasoning was wrong, but the result right, then she would fit in with a number of strong pro-gun advocates,"" he said. ""If, however, she thought there should be no protection for gun rights, then Trump's claim comes closer to the truth."" The Clinton campaign told us Clinton ""believes Heller was wrongly decided in that cities and states should have the power to craft common sense laws to keep their residents safe."" This suggests Clinton disagrees with the court declaring the district’s ban on handguns unconstitutional, not necessarily the individual right itself — a position that’s more or less in line with the George W. Bush administration’s position on Heller of recognizing the right but allowing reasonable curtailment. Our ruling Trump said, ""Hillary Clinton wants to abolish the Second Amendment."" We found no evidence of Clinton ever saying verbatim or suggesting explicitly that she wants to abolish the Second Amendment, and the bulk of Clinton’s comments suggest the opposite. She has repeatedly said she wants to protect the right to bear arms while enacting measures to prevent gun violence. Gun advocates say Trump’s claim is backed up by Clinton’s openness to a gun buyback program and her disagreement with a Supreme Court decision on the Second Amendment. But whether or not these two cherry-picked comments actually reveal Clinton’s intentions is a matter of interpretation. For this claim to hold water, the support for Second Amendment abolition needs to be more direct",False,"May 11, 2016"
"""The Brady Campaign has given me a 100 percent, not 99, 100 percent rating.""","U.S. Rep. Loretta Sanchez, D-Calif., was asked to explain her 2005 vote to offer gun manufacturers liability protections during a debate in the U.S.Senate race. Sanchez never really directly answered the question but said that the law didn’t give gun manufacturers ""blanket immunity."" She then pivoted to talk about her support from the nation’s leading gun control group, the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. ""The Brady Campaign has given me a 100 percent, not 99, 100 percent rating,"" Sanchez said May 10, 2016. ""They say I’m not a lap dog to the gun lobby, and they say I don’t take their money."" The Brady Campaign did say that. But they said a lot of other things -- including some not-so-positive comments on Sanchez’s 2005 vote. We’ll walk you through it. Sanchez on gun issues While Sanchez supports several gun-control measures, such as a mandatory waiting period, a ban on high-capacity magazines and universal background checks, she did vote for the 2005 bill that granted gun makers immunity from lawsuits based on the misuse of their products. To many in the gun control community, this is a blemish on her record, and in April, Sanchez wrote an op-ed in the Sacramento Bee defending that vote. She noted that the full package included some gun control measures, but it was her concern for ""unintended consequences"" that played as large a role. ""I voted for it to prevent frivolous lawsuits against manufacturers,"" Sanchez said. ""If someone uses a baseball bat or hammer to assault you, should the manufacturers be held criminally liable? If you said ‘no,’ then you agree with the principle behind the 2005 law."" The Brady Campaign wasn’t buying it. Four days after Sanchez’s op-ed, the organization issued a press release. ""Loretta Sanchez is dead wrong,"" said Dan Gross, president of the Brady Campaign. ""I find it excruciatingly frustrating that she claimed to have 'fully analyzed unintended consequences' of the law and saw fit to support it nonetheless."" Gross said unlike an auto maker who can be sued, the victims of gun violence have no legal recourse. ""The choice between a victim's right to justice and the possibility of inconveniencing the multibillion dollar gun industry is not a 'tough decision', nor is it 'complicated',"" Gross said. ""Loretta Sanchez is standing on the wrong side of this issue."" Ratings from the Brady Campaign, NRA Sanchez is correct that she received a 100 percent rating from the Brady Campaign in its most recent rankings, which cover the 2013-14 Congress. This was called the ""Lap Dog"" scorecard. But, according to votesmart.org, she has been nicked by the group in the past. Her ""lifetime score"" with the group, which covers only 1991-2009, was 81 percent. On the flip side of the coin, the National Rifle Association has given Sanchez a grade of F in her past two terms, and before that, Ds going back to 2002. ""She cannot defend her vote by parroting the gun lobby's misleading talking points and she cannot sweep this problem under the rug by laying claim to decade-old ratings,"" Gross said in his press release. We did not hear back from Sanchez’s campaign. Our ruling Sanchez said the Brady Campaign has given her a 100 percent rating. They have. But she’s cherry-picking the evidence that puts her in the best light. In reality, the gun-control group just recently wrote a scathing rebuke for Sanchez’s defence of her position on gun maker liability. And she hasn’t always received a 100 percent rating with the group. Sanchez’s claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details",Half True,"May 11, 2016"
"""There’s no data that says a gun-free zone has saved lives.""","A bill that would stop the state’s more than 3,000 concealed-carry permit holders from bringing their weapons into Rhode Island schools quickly became the center of attention at an April 26 Senate Judiciary Committee hearing. Sponsored by Sen. Harold Metts, D-Providence, Senate Bill 2761 would make schools ""gun free zones,"" meaning that only ""peace officers"" — defined in state law as people who are sanctioned by the school and have extensive firearms training — could carry weapons in school zones. This roiled Second Amendment enthusiasts who argued against the bill, saying it would put kids at higher risk for acts of terrorism. Legal gun owners, or ""good guys,"" can help disarm a potential attacker if they are on school grounds before police arrive, Michael O’Neill, a pro-bono lobbyist for the Rhode Island 2nd Amendment Coalition said at the hearing. Sen. Frank Lombardi, D-Cranston, and Sen. Stephen Archambault, D-Smithfield, both agreed with O’Neill on that point. ""If we're going to issue law-abiding concealed-carry permits to people,"" Archambault said, ""... I'd rather know there's a chance someone can put down a lunatic.""   O’Neill added: ""There’s no data that says a gun-free zone has saved lives."" We reached out to O’Neill, and his colleague Frank Saccoccio, also of the Rhode Island 2nd Amendment Coalition, to clarify. We briefly spoke with both men. Saccoccio said he’d send us information via email Tuesday night. By Friday, he hadn’t sent us an email, and he hasn’t returned subsequent emails and phone calls. On the other side of the argument, support for the bill comes from school committees across the state, Attorney General Peter Kilmartin, the Rhode Island Association of School Principals and the Rhode Island Federal of Teachers and Health Professionals, among others. Is it possible that it's not backed up by data? Is there no data?  O’Neill’s statement is tough to refute because it’s so broad, said Linda Finn, a spokeswoman for the Rhode Island Coalition Against Gun Violence. There may not be data that gun-free zones have ""saved lives."" It’s hard to disprove a claim like that. Further, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — the leading national public health institute — has not extensively researched firearms since 1996, when the National Rifle Association accused the agency of promoting gun control. After the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut, President Obama signed an executive order reversing the research ban. But nearly four years later, Congress still hasn’t approved the funding. There is, though, ""plenty of data that shows that when guns are present, it increases the likelihood of an injury or death,"" Finn told us. Like when Michelle Ferguson-Montgomery, a sixth-grade teacher and a concealed-carry permit holder in Utah, shot herself in the leg in the school bathroom in September 2014. Or when an Idaho State University professor literally shot himself in the foot with his concealed gun on campus. Then there’s a psychological phenomenon called the ""weapons effect."" Numerous peer-reviewed studies, including one dating back to 1967, show the presence of a weapon, or just a photo of one, leads to aggressive behavior in humans. This is especially true when stress levels are high -- say, in an active school shooter situation.   The study ""Does the Gun Pull the Trigger?"" published in ""Psychological Science"" in 1996 showed that ""simply identifying weapons increases the accessibility of aggressive thoughts."" This theory played out for a Barrington sixth grader, according to testimony by his father, Willis Peter Bilderback. Bilderback testified that his son became ""very afraid"" after his teacher told him he had a firearm in his desk. The boy was so shaken that he switched out of the class and had repeated nightmares of ""his teacher attempting to track him down with a gun and kill him,"" according to Bilderback’s testimony. ""The fact that my son believed his teacher had a gun in the classroom turned a nationally recognized blue-ribbon Middle School into a house of horrors for him,"" Bilderback wrote. But do ‘good guys"" help? There is anecdotal evidence to back up O’Neill and Archambault’s idea — some of which is outlined in this  Washington Post blog from October 2015. In Chicago in April 2015, an Uber driver with a concealed-carry permit ""shot and wounded a gunman who opened fire on a crowd of people,"" according to a Chicago Tribune report. A similar incident played out in a Philadelphia barber shop. And an FBI ""Study of Active Shooter Incidents in the United States Between 2000 and 2013"" showed that out of the 160 incidents studied, in 21 cases  unarmed citizens ""made the selfless and deeply personal choice"" to confront the shooter, and ended the threat. There were seven times that an armed, off-duty police officer, citizen or security guard used a weapon to end the threat. Our ruling: O’Neill says ""there’s no data that says a gun-free zone has saved lives."" He is correct. There is no definitive data to say that a gun-free zone has saved lives. In part, that’s because the CDC has been blocked from studying anything related to firearms for the last 20 years. And also because ""saved lives"" are hard to quantify. However, there are many anecdotes, scholarly articles and federal studies with data showing that just the presence of guns can cause anxiety and increase aggressive behavior. Plus, there are the teachers who accidentally shot themselves on school grounds. And yes, there are the cases in which the ""good guys"" prevail",Mostly True,"May 8, 2016"
"Says Donald Trump promised to repeal Obamacare, build a wall, ban Muslims, and more.","Even before Donald Trump’s Republican rivals bowed out, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton posted a video warning about a potential Trump presidency. The video opens with a clip of Trump at an event saying, ""Everything I say I’m going to do folks, I do."" It then lists eight steps Trump has said he will take. As the text of each one appears on the screen, audio of Trump plays in the background. We’ll go through in order and assess whether Trump really has made each promise. We asked the Trump campaign if any of these promises were misstated, or if they weren’t actually promises. We did not hear back. ‘Get rid of gun-free zones on schools on his first day’ At a campaign event in Burlington, Vt., on Jan. 7, 2016, Trump said that the number of victims in San Bernardino, Calif., and in Paris would have been much lower if the people in those places had been armed. He lamented the deaths of five soldiers in a shooting rampage in Chattanooga, Tenn. ""I will get rid of gun-free zones on schools, and — you have to — and on military bases,"" Trump said. ""My first day, it gets signed, okay? My first day. There's no more gun-free zones."" The Clinton campaign also cited an interview with Trump on the Outdoor Channel Jan. 21, 2016, in which he said, ""I'm going to get rid of gun-free zones on military bases. I'm also going to do it in schools."" Trump has said little recently about gun-free zones, but the issue resurfaced when a petition emerged that would allow delegates to the Republican National Convention to carry guns. On March 28, 2016, ABC reporter Jonathan Karl asked Trump if he would support that. Trump said he would consider the petition, but the Secret Service ruled out allowing guns at the conventions as a security risk. ‘Defund Planned Parenthood’ Trump’s stance on funding Planned Parenthood has shifted somewhat over time. In August 2015, he told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt that it would be worth shutting down the government to cut off tax dollars going to Planned Parenthood. But he has also praised the organization for providing regular care to women of limited means. In March, Trump said, ""Millions of women have been helped by Planned Parenthood,"" and then continued ""but we're not going to allow, and we're not going to fund, as long as you have the abortion going on at Planned Parenthood."" Trump’s overarching position on taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood is that he supports defunding Planned Parenthood so long as the organization continues to perform abortions. ‘Repeal Obamacare’ There doesn’t seem to be any ambiguity on this one. On his campaign website, Trump says ""On day one of the Trump Administration, we will ask Congress to immediately deliver a full repeal of Obamacare."" ‘Build a great great wall’ Trump has made building a wall along the border with Mexico his signature initiative, and he hasn’t wavered. He has said it many times. In the course of interviews with the New York Times published May 4, 2016, he said within his first 100 days the wall would be designed, and there would be bilateral talks with Mexico, presumably on how they would pay for it -- another promise Trump has made. Establish ‘a deportation force’ There is no question that Trump called for teams to remove an estimated 11 million people who are in the country without authorization. The term itself goes back to an interview Trump gave on MSNBC in November 2015 when he said ""You’re going to have a deportation force. And you’re going to do it humanely."" We couldn’t find Trump promoting this again, although in the Feb. 25, 2016, Republican debate, he didn’t back away from the phrase. CNN moderator Wolf Blitzer teed up a question saying, ""Mr. Trump, you've called for a deportation force to remove the 11 million undocumented immigrants from the United States."" Trump prefaced his answer with a cut at his rivals for supporting amnesty and then said, ""We either have a country, or we don't have a country. We have at least 11 million people in this country that came in illegally. They will go out."" Trump has definitely committed to expanding the number of immigration and border control agents and to removing 11 million people. He hasn’t said if he would create a new deportation unit. While he might not be touting the same phrase, the result remains the same. ‘Ban Muslims from entering the country’ Immediately after the shootings by Muslim fundamentalists in San Bernardino in December 2015, the Trump campaign issued a statement saying, ""Donald Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure out what is going on."" Within a few days, Trump said certain people would be exempted, including American citizens who are Muslim, foreign leaders, and athletes headed to competitions. However, according to the New York Times, within his first 100 days ""the immigration ban on Muslims would be in place."" That puts the ban firmly in the promise zone. ‘Kill the spouses and children of our enemies’ Trump said this during an interview on Fox and Friends, Dec. 2, 2015. ""The other thing with the terrorists is you have to take out their families, when you get these terrorists, you have to take out their families,"" Trump said. In an interview with Fox News’ Bill O’Reilly, Trump seemed to dial down this threat. O’Reilly asked him if he would have killed members of the bin Laden family. Trump said ""I don't want to be so bold. I want to tell you they would suffer."" Trump was pressed on this at the Republican debate in Las Vegas on Dec. 15, 2015. Asked how this policy would set the United States apart from ISIS, Trump said, ""We have to be much tougher."" Trump finished his answer with, ""I would be very, very firm with families. Frankly, that will make people think because they may not care much about their lives, but they do care, believe it or not, about their families’ lives."" While this could be a death threat, it isn’t quite as clear as his original statement. Clearly, he wants to make family members suffer, but he doesn’t say how much. Restore waterboarding and ‘go further’ In the Republican debate right before the New Hampshire primary, Trump said, ""I would bring back waterboarding and I’d bring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding."" Trump stood by his waterboarding policy on March 22, 2016, telling CNN’s Wolf Blitzer he would ""go further."" Trump has also said that ""torture works."" The only caveat that Trump offered during his CNN interview is that he would listen to military officials’ advice on the use of interrogation methods. Whether a Trump administration would ever use waterboarding, he has promised to keep it on the table. Our ruling A Clinton campaign video listed eight steps Trump has promised to take as president. Five of those are firmly on the Trump agenda. That includes repealing Obamacare, building a wall along the Mexican border, deporting illegal immigrants, banning Muslims at the border, and restoring waterboarding and other torture techniques. On eliminating gun-free zones on school grounds, he hasn’t repeated it recently, but we saw no evidence he had changed his stance. There might be some debate over his plan to defund Planned Parenthood, because he links that to continued abortions. However, there is no indication that the group plans to stop providing that service, so a President Trump would need to cut funding if he wanted to keep his promise. The one exaggeration in the video is his threat to kill the families of terrorists. Trump seems to have backed off that promise. He has said he would make them suffer, not necessarily kill them. The video might miss a couple of nuances, but it is generally accurate",Mostly True,"May 5, 2016"
"Says Danny Tarkanian is ""NRA ‘F’ Rated.""","Politicians on both sides often wear National Rifle Association grades as a badge of pride, but one Nevada Republican is fighting off claims that he received a failing grade from the gun advocacy group. Republican Danny Tarkanian, who’s running for Nevada’s 3rd Congressional District, is the target of a series of Web ads promoted by his primary opponent, state Sen. Michael Roberson, attacking his alleged poor grades from the NRA. The ads implied that Tarkanian has a poor record on Second Amendment issues, with one claiming that he is ""playing games with our gun rights.""  Only a handful of Nevada lawmakers have been the recipient of NRA F marks. We wanted to know if Tarkanian really received a failing grade, and if so, why. Failing grade NRA grades and endorsements are made by lobbyists and analysts who follow state and federal firearm issues, and are generally only supposed to represent a snapshot in time. ""Candidate ratings for previous election cycles were compiled in the year of the election and may no longer accurately represent a candidate’s or elected official’s position or rating,"" the NRA’s website says. (The NRA did not return our requests for comment on this fact-check.) Tarkanian’s F grade came a decade ago, during his Tarkanian’s unsuccessful bid for Nevada secretary of state. But isn’t such a simple snapshot of his position on guns. During that 2006 race, the pro-gun control Brady Campaign for Gun Violence released a recorded robo-call supporting his candidacy. Tarkanian told PolitiFact that he doesn’t dispute the grade, but he never solicited the endorsement. ""I didn’t know about it, and I didn’t ask for it,"" he said. ""I have never in my life spoken to the Brady organization."" The timeline on the grade is slightly murky. Tarkanian says he wasn’t involved, and the NRA’s former lobbyist covering Nevada, Carrie Herbertson, passed away in 2014. But former Brady Campaign president Paul Helmke said someone from the Tarkanian campaign solicited the endorsement, because the group doesn’t typically involve itself in down-ballot races. ""There’s no way we would have been involved in (the) secretary of state race in Nevada unless somebody from the campaign got involved,"" he said. Dan Burdish, who served as an unpaid adviser to Tarkanian in 2006, said his memory was fuzzy but he believed the failing grade was due to confusion over some of the topics on the questionnaire. ""It just got screwed up,"" he said. Burdish said Tarkanian’s mother, Las Vegas City Councilwoman Lois Tarkanian, contacted the Brady Campaign about endorsing him in the secretary of state race against eventual winner Ross Miller, who got an A from the NRA in 2006. Lois Tarkanian didn’t return multiple calls seeking comment. Second Amendment issues didn’t appear to play a major role in the race, as a cached version of Tarkanian’s 2006 campaign website doesn’t mention firearms and a pre-election preview in the Las Vegas Sun doesn’t mention guns. The F rating resurfaced during Tarkanian’s 2010 run for U.S. Senate, when his then-primary opponent Sue Lowden tried to revive it as a campaign issue. Tarkanian campaign manager James Fisfis told the Las Vegas Review-Journal in 2009 that earlier poor grades were the result of a ""misunderstanding"" with the surveys. Tarkanian didn’t fill out the questionnaire in 2004 during his run for state Senate, and he received a C+ during his 2012 bid for a U.S. House seat. There’s no record of a grade during his unsuccessful U.S. Senate primary bid in 2010. Nevada Firearms Coalition president Don Turner said his state-based group gave Tarkanian an A rating in 2014, but doesn’t plan to endorse in the current primary. Roberson has a consistent A from the NRA, receiving high marks during his 2010 and 2014 state Senate elections. Tarkanian has generally run on a pro-Second Amendment platform since 2010. He’s written multiple op-eds highly critical of an assault weapon ban and supported reciprocity for concealed weapon permits throughout different states. On his current campaign website, Tarkanian clearly states his firearm policy: ""I oppose any and all efforts to register guns and their owners, and I oppose any and all efforts to restrict the sale or ownership of guns by law-abiding citizens."" Our ruling A series of Web ads claim Tarkanian has an F rating from the NRA. Tarkanian did receive an F rating from the NRA in 2006, and he also received the blessing of the pro-gun control Brady Campaign. But NRA endorsements are intended to only last for one election cycle, and Tarkanian has planted himself well within conservative orthodoxy on gun issues at least since 2010. In 2012, the most recent grade available, he earned a C+. Roberson’s ad cherry-picked a decade-old rating and left out context about Tarkanian’s more recent comments in opposition to gun control",Half True,"May 3, 2016"

""If you go to a gun show, you can get an unlicensed seller to sell you a gun, no questions asked,"" Dunnigan added We’ve looked at similar claims before. Because this sketch is getting a lot of attention, we wanted to recap whether a felon can actually buy a gun on the Internet or at a gun show. This isn’t the first time Schumer has tackled gun issues; she has been a vocal advocate for stricter gun laws since a gunman killed two and injured many others at a showing of her feature film Trainwreck in a Louisiana movie theater in 2015. But it is her first time on the Truth-O-Meter. The 'gun show loophole' To be clear: The kind of transaction Schumer’s character describes is illegal. Federal law prohibits felons from getting a gun unless their rights have been formally restored. Felons can theoretically get around this obstacle, however, by buying guns from unlicensed sellers who are not required to conduct criminal background checks. This is sometimes referred to as the ""gun show loophole,"" even though it refers to all private sales, and not everyone considers it a loophole. Schumer’s sketch was referring to this aspect of current gun law, said a spokesman for Everytown for Gun Safety, gun control advocacy group Schumer promotes at the end of the sketch. Anyone who repeatedly buys and sells firearms ""with the principal motive of making a profit"" is supposed to get a dealer’s license, whether they deal out of a brick-and-mortar store, a gun show, or online, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Licensed firearm dealers must run background checks on non-licensed buyers before selling them a gun. But the law does not require a dealer’s license for private hobbyists and others who occasionally buy and sell guns. If an individual buys a gun from someone who is not required to have a license, the purchaser does not have to undergo a background check. So a violent felon could buy a gun from a hobbyist over the Internet or at a gun show because he or she would not be subject to a background check. The purchase would still be illegal, because of the buyer’s felon status, but it would not create an immediate red flag. The same thing can happen at a gun show. There are a few important limitations on these sorts of private transactions. First, it is illegal for private sellers to transfer a gun to someone they either know or reasonably believe is prohibited from owning a gun, for example, if the seller knows the buyer is a felon. But private sellers ""can give themselves plausible deniability by not asking the necessary questions,"" Garen Wintemute, a professor of emergency medicine at the University of California Davis, previously told PolitiFact. So in the case of Schumer’s show, she and her co-host would not have that cushion of plausible deniability because the hopeful buyer told them outright that he is a felon. The giant ""gun show"" banner doesn’t make a difference. Second, private sales, online or otherwise, cannot take place across state lines, so the buyer and seller must be in the same state. And there are many restrictions on shipping guns, so the actual transaction is likely to take place in person, as opposed to the buyer entering credit card information online, and the seller shipping the gun to the buyer’s house. And third, several states — California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington — and the District of Columbia require background checks for all private gun sales. With all these restrictions, how many people actually buy guns without a background check? The truth is we don’t really know. The only statistics floating around are outdated and flawed. Professors at Northeastern and Harvard universities conducted a gun survey in 2015 that isn’t yet published. The national survey of 4,000 non-institutionalized adults found that 22 percent of the people who purchased guns — at gun shows, stores or elsewhere — underwent no background check, Matthew Miller, professor of Health Sciences and Epidemiology at Northeastern and co-director of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center, told us in January. When researchers excluded purchases between family and friends, that number dropped to 15 percent, which equates to approximately 5 million gun owners whose most recent purchase did not involve a background check. One more thing: Later in Schumer’s sketch, another hopeful buyer calls in to ask if he can get a gun even though he’s a suspected terrorist on the no-fly list. ""You’re fine, sweet potato fry,"" Schumer’s character says. A March 2015 report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office examined how many people applying for gun purchases went through the FBI’s instant background check system and also were on the FBI’s list of ""those known or reasonably suspected of being involved in terrorist activity."" Between February 2004, and December 2014, 2,233 people on the list applied to buy a weapon. Of those, 2,043 were allowed to proceed. Our ruling Schumer’s character said, ""You can absolutely get a gun if you have several felonies as long as you buy it on the Internet or at a gun show."" The kind of transaction Schumer described is possible, though illegal, and far more complicated than her comment suggests. Federal law prohibits felons from buying guns. But with some effort, they could purchase a gun from private sellers over the Internet or at a gun show without getting caught, because private sellers are not required to run background checks. Schumer is doing a comedy bit, but compared with similar claims we’ve checked, her phrasing makes it sound like buying guns with a felony is easy and lawful. That is not the case.

"""Steve Santarsiero wrote PA’s Gun Safety Law.""","Pennsylvania laws that govern gun safety regulations were written by state legislators for decades before Steve Santarsiero was elected to a state House seat. But the Bucks County state representative who’s now a candidate for Congress is taking credit for legislation that governs gun safety in Pennsylvania. A mailer sent by his campaign claims Santarsiero, a Democrat running for a seat in the eighth congressional district, ""wrote PA’s Gun Safety Law."" Pennsylvania doesn’t have a law named for gun safety. So we decided to look a little deeper into Santarsiero’s gun-related claims to see which law his campaign was touting. The ad goes on to state: ""After the shooting at Sandy Hook, Steve said ‘enough is enough’ and wrote legislation to close the background check loophole on gun sales and introduced a bill to stop those on the federal terrorist watch list from purchasing firearms in Pennsylvania."" That’s true, but neither of those bills were passed into law. Santarsiero’s campaign manager Eric Goldman said the campaign ""should have more clearly stated he has been fighting for it to become law,"" but added the mailer was not ""intentionally misleading."" He said other mailers and television ads on the issue referred to the legislation as a bill or a proposed law. While Pennsylvania law currently requires background checks for gun purchases from licensed dealers and for the private sale of handguns, Santarsiero’s background check bill would have added a stipulation that private sales of long guns are also subject to a background checks. He first introduced his background checks bill in 2013 and reintroduced it in 2015, but the bill has never been brought to a vote and was last referred to the House Judiciary Committee in October 2015. Similarly, a bill Santarsiero was the prime sponsor of last year would have prohibited the sale of firearms to anyone currently on the federal terrorist watch list, including no-fly lists. That bill was never brought to a vote and was last referred to the House Judiciary Committee in January. In addition to those gun safety-related bills authored by Santarsiero, the state representative implied in his campaign mailer that Pennsylvania has an overarching gun safety law. No such law exists. Gun safety is regulated by the Pennsylvania Uniform Firearms Act, the last major version of which was written in 1995. Santarsiero was first elected to the state House in 2008. Santarsiero is running in the April 26 primary to replace Rep. Mike Fitzpatrick, a Republican who isn’t seeking re-election. Guns have been at the center of his debates with his primary opponent Shaughnessy Naughton, a magazine publisher. Her campaign manager Erik Polyak called the mailer misleading, saying Santarsiero is ""always exaggerating the record."" A recent television ad released by Santarsiero’s campaign doesn’t include the claim that he wrote a ""gun safety law,"" but rather states that he leads in pushing for expanded background checks in Pennsylvania. Since the school shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. that left 20 children and six adults dead, six states have expanded background check regulations. Our ruling Santarsiero, a candidate for Congress, claims in a recent campaign mailer that he ""wrote PA’s Gun Safety Law."" The campaign goes on to reference two bills that were authored by Santarsiero but that never made it out of committee. In addition, Pennsylvania doesn’t have an overarching law that governs ""gun safety"" and the law that does govern gun safety wasn’t written by Santarsiero",False,"April 21, 2016"
"About ""1 percent of all the gun sellers are responsible for more than half of the guns that are used in crimes.""","When Hillary Clinton brought her presidential campaign to Milwaukee’s Tabernacle Community Baptist Church on March 29, 2016, she participated in a forum on gun violence with U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore, D-Milwaukee, and others. The Democratic front runner spoke softly as she recounted a number of fatal firearms encounters, in Milwaukee and across the country. Then she raised her voice as she presented some of her gun control policy proposals. And she made a claim that we want to check about guns used in crimes. ""The availability of guns has gone way too far. And the fact that gun-makers and -sellers are immune from liability …. Gwen will talk about what we need to do to stop some of these gun sellers,"" Clinton said. ""About, what, 1 percent of all the gun sellers are responsible for more than half of the guns that are used in crimes. So, we've got our work cut out for us. But let's not grow weary doing good, because in due time we will harvest if we stay focused."" We found there is some truth in Clinton’s 1 percent claim, but several significant caveats. Old data Experts told us the latest federal report that gets at Clinton’s claim, from 2000, is from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. Relying on gun tracing data, the report found that 1.2 percent of licensed gun dealers accounted for more than 57 percent of the crime guns traced to current dealers in 1998. So, Clinton’s claim might generally appear correct in terms of the figures. But there are a few things to tease out. 1. Clinton made her claim in the present tense and is relying on the latest, best data available -- but that data is 18 years old. The experts told us that ever since federal law was changed in 2003, tracing data has essentially dried up. That was when Congress approved the so-called Tiahrt Amendment, named for its original sponsor, U.S. Rep. Todd Tiahrt, R-Kan. It forbids the ATF from sharing information about guns it has traced with state and local police agencies except in the course of a criminal investigation. The change ""greatly restricted"" the release of crime gun trace data by the ATF, restricted access by researchers and plaintiff trial attorneys, and restricted what reports the ATF could issue themselves, said Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research. 2. Clinton’s claim was about ""guns used in crimes,"" while the 2000 report referred to ""crime guns."" There’s a slight difference. Harvard University professor of health policy David Hemenway, who does research on firearms, told us that most any gun seized by police is considered a crime gun. That would include, of course, seized guns that were used in crimes, but also guns found by police that couldn’t be traced to particular crimes. 3. In referring to the 1 percent of gun dealers, Clinton said they were ""responsible"" for more than half of the guns used in crimes. But that doesn’t mean a gun used in a crime came directly from the dealer. Hemenway said that authorities trace crime guns to their original seller, but can’t necessarily determine whether other transactions of the gun were made prior to it being used in a crime. In other words, it’s possible to trace a crime gun to the store that originally sold it, but that gun might have changed hands any number of times -- legally or illegally -- before it was used in a crime. On the other hand, said Webster, gun dealers ""are one of the most important, if not the most important, conduit for guns into the underground market."" So, there is rationale for targeting gun sellers linked to crime guns to prevent, for example, purchases by a straw buyer -- a person who legally purchases a gun in order to turns it over to someone who cannot legally purchase one. (Tracing helped establish that a suburban Milwaukee gun store was a top seller of crime guns locally for more than a decade.) Our rating Clinton said about ""1 percent of all the gun sellers are responsible for more than half of the guns that are used in crimes."" The best data essentially backs up the claim, but it is from 1998. It’s also worth noting that the traces go back to the original seller of a crime gun and don’t take into account whether there were other transactions before a particular gun was used in a crime",Half True,"April 15, 2016"
"""We have tougher standards holding toy gun manufacturers and sellers to account than we do for real guns.""","Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders voted for a law that gave higher standards to toy guns than real guns, opponent Hillary Clinton charged at the New York Democratic debate. A 2005 law put restrictions on people’s ability to sue the gun industry for crimes committed using their products. As Clinton often points out, she voted against this law, while Sanders voted for it. ""We have tougher standards holding toy gun manufacturers and sellers to account than we do for real guns,"" Clinton said April 14. The claim that this law gives higher standards to toy guns is something Clinton has said in recent weeks. It’s not a settled question. Here’s why. A liability gap? The law at issue is the 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, which was signed into law by President George W. Bush and seen as a victory for gun rights advocates. The purpose of the law is to protect gun dealers and manufacturers from lawsuits when their products are misused, meaning if a gun dealer legally sells a person a gun, and then the buyer uses the gun to commit a crime, the gun dealer and manufacturer cannot be held liable for the crime. The law arose after victims, cities and states started to bring lawsuits against gunmakers that pursued new legal paths, such as one that argued manufacturers Glock Inc. and China North Industries had oversaturated the market, producing so many guns that it was inevitable some would fall into criminal hands. Most judges dismissed these kinds of lawsuits, but a minority allowed them to proceed. There are several situations that are not protected from lawsuits under the law. It does not protect gun dealers who transfer a gun knowing it would be used for criminal purposes, nor those who knowingly break state or federal law if the violation results in harm. Gun manufacturers can also be sued if the gun, when used properly, causes injury because the product is defective. Opponents argue that the law stops some victims from having their day in court because the liability immunity is so broad and ambiguous, while the exceptions are narrow. Supporters, though, say the law protects gun dealers and manufacturers from frivolous and expensive legal proceedings. We’ve written before that Congress has passed laws giving some other industries varying levels of immunity. A couple experts told us Clinton’s statement is unsound because the law sought to impose equivalent, rather than fewer, standards for gun makers that are already established for manufacturers of other products. As it stands, the victim of a crime committed with a toy — say, if a person seriously injured another person by shooting them with bb gun pellets — generally cannot sue the toy manufacturer, just as they can’t sue Toyota or Budweiser if they’re struck by a drunk person driving a Prius. The 2005 law ""basically put gun manufacturers in the same position that other product manufacturers are in,"" said Eugene Volokh, a law professor at the University of California Los Angeles. ""They’re responsible for defectively manufactured and designed products but not for failing to prevent criminal misuse of their products."" Additionally, toy guns and real guns pose fundamentally different risks because real guns are much more likely to be used in a crime than a toy gun, said Timothy Lytton, a Georgia State University law professor who edited a book on suing the gun industry. So before the law, the gun industry was subject to a wider range of liability that just doesn’t apply to a toy. As such, it’s hard to imagine a realistic incident with a toy gun that would cause someone to bring a suit against the toy company, yet they would not be able to sue a gun manufacturer for an equivalent situation involving a real gun. A hypothetical situation might be if a city experienced an epidemic of deaths or injuries that resulted from a prevalence of realistic-looking toy guns; think of the recent story of Tamir Rice, a Cleveland child carrying a toy gun who a police officer shot and killed, said Alexandra Lahav, a professor of civil procedure at the University of Connecticut School of Law. In that case, a city might want to bring a suit against the toy gun manufacturer or seller for creating a public nuisance. But under the 2005 law, a city cannot sue a gun company if there is an epidemic of people being injured or killed by their guns. Lahav added, though, that she thinks the idea someone would bring a suit like this against a toy company is highly unlikely. In theory, there might be a liability gap between toy guns and real guns, but that wouldn't necessarily play out in reality, she said. Toy and real gun manufacturers can be sued for product defects that cause injury when the product is used as intended. But if an injury is caused by a product defect coupled with a criminal misuse of the product, a toy gun manufacturer could be held liable, but a real gun manufacturer could not under the 2005 law, said Adam Winkler, also a UCLA law professor and an expert in the Second Amendment. That limits the gun industry’s incentives to make their products as safe as possible. The fact that a party cannot even attempt to bring these kinds of lawsuits against real gun manufacturers sets them apart from other industries, including toys, said Mark Geistfeld, a law professor at New York University and an expert in products liability. Such lawsuits against the gun industry might be destined to fail, but the 2005 law doesn’t even allow for the arguments to be tested. ""You’ve granted an immunity to the gun industry that you haven’t granted to any other industry,"" Geistfeld said of Sanders, noting that this supports the gist of Clinton’s point: that Sanders holds guns to a lower standard. Lytton noted, though, that he would not presume to know whether Sanders or anyone else who voted for the law would grant similar immunity to the toy industry if the opportunity arose. ""It’s not fair to basically enter into hyperbole that somehow he treated firearms differently (so) he would come down harder on toy guns,"" Lytton said. Our ruling Clinton said, ""We have tougher standards holding toy gun manufacturers and sellers to account than we do for real guns."" She’s parroting a line she has stated previously. Clinton points to a 2005 law granting the gun industry certain immunity from lawsuits. In her camp are scholars who believe the law made the gun industry less susceptible to liability than other industries, including the toy gun industry. But other scholars think the law made the gun industry’s liability about the same as that of a toy gun manufacturer. And because real guns carry so much more risk for injury than toy guns, it’s hard to compare them effectively",Half True,"April 14, 2016"
"""The state that has the highest per capita number of … guns that end up committing crimes in New York come from Vermont.""","As the April 19 New York presidential primary approached, Hillary Clinton sought to draw a contrast with rival Bernie Sanders on gun policy. During an April 11 appearance in Port Washington, N.Y., for what was billed as a ""conversation on gun violence,"" Clinton took issue with Sanders’ characterization of his home state, Vermont, in the gun policy debate. Sanders has said that Vermonters have a more tolerant attitude toward guns than more urbanized states like New York, because of their state’s small, rural nature. In Port Washington, Clinton said that doesn’t excuse Vermont from being part of the problem for cities grappling with the spread of out-of-state guns. ""Here's what I want you to know,"" Clinton told the audience, according to CBS News. ""Most of the guns that are used in crimes and violence and killings in New York come from out of state. And the state that has the highest per capita number of those guns that end up committing crimes in New York come from Vermont. ""So this is not, 'Oh, you know, I live in a rural state, we don't have any of these problems,' "" she added. ""This is, you know what, it's easy to cross borders, criminals, domestic abusers, traffickers, people who are mentally ill, they cross borders too and sometimes they do it to get the guns they use. This has to become a voting issue for those of us who want to save lives."" This talking point was several days in the making; PolitiFact attempted to fact-check a similar claim she reportedly made during a closed-door event on April 4. But we were unable to nail down the wording through a recording -- until Clinton offered the version in Port Washington a week later. Our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker gave Clinton’s claim Three Pinocchios out of a maximum of four -- not a very favorable score. But we’ll take a fresh look here. When we asked the Clinton campaign for evidence, they pointed us to a report from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives covering calendar year 2014. The report looks at firearm ""tracing"" data, an investigative and statistical tool used by the ATF to discern how a gun traveled from its point of origin to its ultimate destination, at which point the gun is often involved in the commission of a crime. A chart in the report included Vermont in the top 15 ""source states"" for guns, with 55 guns from Vermont ending up in in New York. Here’s that chart:  That’s actually one of the smallest raw numbers of any of the 15 highlighted states -- beyond New York itself, the biggest states in raw numbers of guns were Virginia, Georgia and Pennsylvania. These states, especially Virginia, are more commonly associated with the ""Iron Pipeline"" that some analysts have described in which guns flow up Interstate 95, from southern states with looser gun laws to northern states with stricter laws. But it’s important to note that Clinton said ""per capita."" So we divided the per-state gun haul by the state’s population and confirmed that Vermont does indeed have the highest rate per capita, thanks to its tiny population. (Guns from elsewhere in New York ranked second, followed by South Carolina, Georgia and Virginia.) So we have no quarrel with the accuracy of Clinton’s numbers. Instead, the dispute is about whether this per-capita number has any relevance to the gun-policy debate. In a statement, the Clinton campaign said that the per-capita number is ""critically important"" because ""it shows just how dangerous Vermont's laws are relative to other states. If Vermont had the population of California, it would source roughly 3,800 crime guns each year to New York -- far more than the top 15 total source states for New York crime guns combined."" However, the academic experts we checked with echoed the concerns from the Fact Checker article -- that the raw numbers matter much more than the per-capita numbers do. John Roman, a senior fellow in the Justice Policy Center at the Urban Institute, told PolitiFact that ""many guns used in violent events come from a very small number of dealers, usually unlicensed gun show folks or shady businesses. That's the problem with this denominator -- the size of the state's population doesn't matter, the number of bad dealers does."" The strongest support we found for using the per capita data came from Ted Alcorn, research director at Everytown for Gun Safety, an anti-gun-violence group. But even he was even-handed about the comparative usefulness of the two measures. If you were a policymaker, Alcorn said, and you ""had the ability to turn on off the spigot, of course you’d want to reduce the top-source states"" as measured by raw numbers, he said. At the same time, he added, having an analytical tool along the lines of a per capita measurement is valuable for deciding where to pinpoint law enforcement resources. ""If you’re looking at the state level, and if you’re just concerned with the absolute numbers, you’ll only focus on the big states and never focus on the small states,"" he said. That said, Alcorn said other types of measurements will often be more valuable than the state per-capita data Clinton is pointing to -- particularly if you can drill down to whether specific stores are seeing a disproportionately large share of the guns they sell end up in New York. Experts we checked with offered a couple other concerns with Clinton’s statement: • The ATF’s trace data is not random or comprehensive. In fact, this point was made in the very same report the Clinton campaign cited. It said: ""Not all firearms used in crime are traced and not all firearms traced are used in crime. ... The firearms selected do not constitute a random sample and should not be considered representative of the larger universe of all firearms used by criminals, or any subset of that universe."" Jay Corzine, a sociologist at the University of Central Florida who studies gun issues, said this is an important caveat. ""The ATF tracing data is the best we have, but for a gun to show up in the data set, it has to be recovered by the police and the police have to make the decision to have the source of the gun traced,"" Corzine said. ""Nobody really knows what the level of bias happens to be. It may be minimal or it may be substantial."" • Traced guns have not necessarily been trafficked. This is the case even though Clinton used the specific word ""traffickers"" in her comments. ""If Joe Gunowner moves from Vermont to New York, gets burglarized and loses a gun, and that gun is used later in crime, is recovered by police, and is traced by ATF, it will show up as a crime gun that originated in Vermont -- but it most definitely did not involve gun trafficking,"" said Gary Kleck, a professor of criminology and criminal justice at Florida State University. It’s impossible to know how common this scenario is, but Kleck believes it’s substantial. The flow of guns across state borders is ""a reflection of the very mobile character of the American population,"" he said. • Geography matters. The question of geography cuts both ways when measuring the validity of Clinton’s claim. On the one hand, a small-population state with relatively loose gun laws that happens to share a long border with New York may carry added significance than a larger-population state with equally loose gun laws that’s located much further away. On the other hand, it may be the case that the guns from Vermont are flowing into the neighboring areas of Upstate New York, rather than higher-crime areas around New York City that are more supportive of restrictive gun laws. (Corzine is one who thinks that’s quite possible.) We don’t know the answer to this question for sure, however, due to laws restricting the public release of data with greater detail. Our ruling Clinton said ""the state that has the highest per capita number of … guns that end up committing crimes in New York come from Vermont."" Clinton’s specific statistical computation is accurate. But beyond the numbers, Clinton’s claim is misleading for a varied number of reasons. From a policy perspective, experts say raw numbers of gun flows are likely a better measure. And while the ATF data set is the best we have, Clinton’s bold comment glosses over some important caveats about the data, including whether the guns it captures are representative and whether they line up with ""trafficking."" These caveats call into question whether Vermont’s gun policies are having the effect Clinton suggests",Half True,"April 12, 2016"
"States with ""the highest gun ownership rates also have the highest suicide rates.""","Former U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords, D-Ariz., who was gravely wounded in a 2011 mass shooting near Tucson, recently visited Virginia’s Capitol to push for tougher gun laws. She and her husband, retired astronaut Mark Kelly, launched a coalition that will seek ""common-sense solutions"" to gun violence in the state. High on its list is convincing a resistant General Assembly to close loopholes in Virginia’s background check law for prospective gun buyers. About a dozen community leaders and law-enforcement experts met with Giffords and Kelly to help set strategies. Among them was Mira Signer, executive director of the Virginia chapter of the National Alliance on Mental Illness. She said the availability of guns poses special risks to those with mental disorders. States ""that have the highest gun ownership also have the highest suicide rates,"" she said. ""The evidence is there. We know that."" We wondered whether Signer’s statement is correct. Signer told us her claim is based in part on a report called ""The Truth About Guns and Suicide,"" published in September 2015 by the Brady Center & Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, a nonprofit advocating gun control. The report says, ""Studies examining firearm ownership and suicide rates at the national, state and regional levels provide further evidence of the firearm-suicide connection. They show that suicide rates, both overall and by firearm, are higher in areas where gun ownership is more widespread."" Footnotes in the report say the Brady Center’s statement is based on a series of studies by the Harvard Injury Control Research Center in Massachusetts - the last published in 2008. Researchers compared data that the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention kept from 2000 to 2002 on the number of suicides in each state and the percentage of households in each state where at least one firearm was held. ""Among men, among women, and in every age group (including children), states with the higher rates of household gun ownership had higher rates of firearm suicides and overall suicides,"" the researchers wrote in an article published by The New England Journal of Medicine. Back then Why rely today on statistics that are more than decade old? Researchers say they’re still the best numbers available. Every year, the CDC conducts an extensive health-risk poll with more than 250,000 U.S. adults that ‘s called the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. It used to ask participants whether they had guns in their homes. With its huge sample, the results could be broken down to statistically reliable percentages of households with a gun in each state. The CDC, under congressional demands to stop researching gun issues, removed the question from the survey after 2004. Since then, no other poll has offered a reliable, detailed look at gun ownership rates in each state. The CDC surveys showed that the top three states for percentage of household gun ownership - Wyoming, Montana and Alaska - often ranked as the three states with the highest suicide rates. Roughly 60 percent of households held firearms in those states, much higher than the national median of 40 percent. Their suicide rates, according to other CDC data, hovered around 20 people per 100,000 - nearly double the national average of about 11 per 100,000. Conversely, the nine states with the lowest per-household gun ownership from 2001 to 2004 also had the nine lowest suicide rates. They were Hawaii, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, California, Illinois and Maryland. Overall, the statistics show a distinct correlation between gun ownership and suicide rates in states. There are, of course, anomalies. Nevada, for example, ranked 36th in the percentage of households with guns from 2001 to 2004 but had fourth-highest suicide rate. Virginia, if you’re wondering, ranked 32nd in the percentage of household with guns and 34th in suicide rate during that period. Today Signer’s statement was made in present tense, so there’s an issue of whether these old findings remain relevant. The ranking of states based on suicide rates barely has changed over the years, according CDC data for 2013 - the latest final statistics available. Wyoming, Alaska and Montana still had the highest rates. So that leaves the problem on quantifying household gun ownership in each state without updated, exhaustive surveys from the CDC. YouGov, an international market research firm, conducted an Internet poll in 2013 that asked 4,622 U.S. adults to participate in an online survey that asked whether they owned guns. YouGov broke the numbers down by state and got results that broadly resembled the CDC figures. Columbia University researchers used those figures in a 2013 paper on the gun culture in states and regions around the U.S. Bindu Kalesan, the lead researcher, told us in an email that the numbers for many states have a high margin of error. Many analysts, in exploring a variety of gun issues, still cite the CDC state figures. David Hemenway, director of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center, told us the numbers still are relevant. ""Gun ownership levels across states hardly change over time,"" he said. ""For example, the best predictors of whether you will own a gun is whether you grew up with guns and whether your neighbors are gun owners or not."" These indicators, Hemenway said, ""don’t switch back and forth."" Hemenway sent us four studies from other researchers that also connected the presence of guns to high suicide rates. ""It all makes sense psychologically,"" he said, ""since so many suicides are pretty spontaneous with little planning and people use whatever is handy. The urge passes and people who have survived even serious suicide attempts rarely go on to kill themselves. The case fatality rate for guns is 90 percent, while the case fatality rate for the two most common forms of suicide attempts - pills and cutting - is under 3 percent."" Our ruling Signer said states that have ""the highest gun ownership rates also have the highest suicide rates."" Exhaustive data collected by the CDC at the start of the century supports her statement. The three states with the highest percentage of household gun ownership - Alaska, Wyoming and Montana - also had the three highest suicide rates. The correlation between the availability of guns and suicide rates, while not as exact across the nation, certainly existed in most other states. The nine states with the lowest household gun rates also had the lowest suicide rates. The ranking of states by their suicide rates barely has changed over the years.

"Says Bernie Sanders ""wants higher standards for toy guns than real guns.""","Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders is putting gun manufacturers ahead of the Sandy Hook victims, says opponent Hillary Clinton. Twenty school-age children were killed in the 2012 shooting massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. Now, some family members of the victims are attempting to sue gun manufacturer Remington, which produced shooter Adam Lanza’s weapon, as well as the wholesaler and a local retailer. But it’s questionable whether this lawsuit will be able to proceed, given a 2005 law that put restrictions on the gun industry’s liability for crimes committed using their products. As Clinton often points out, she voted against this law, while Sanders voted for it. ""I voted against it,"" Clinton said on CNN April 6. ""President Obama voted against it. Because clearly it was an effort to bypass legal accountability. And so here we have this remarkable situation where you cannot question the liability or the behavior of gunmakers and sellers. I thought Sen. Chris Murphy from Connecticut really summed it up. He said Sen. Sanders wants higher standards for toy guns than real guns."" The claim that Sanders wants higher standards for toy guns than real guns caught our attention. We wondered if Sanders’ support for this law indicates that he thinks toy manufacturers should be more open to lawsuits than gun manufacturers. We talked to a number of experts on gun law and products liability, and they disagreed over whether Clinton is standing on solid ground. A liability gap? The law at issue is the 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, which was signed into law by President George W. Bush and seen as a victory for gun rights advocates. The purpose of the law is to protect gun dealers and manufacturers from lawsuits when their products are misused, meaning if a gun dealer legally sells a person a gun, and then the buyer uses the gun to commit a crime, the gun dealer and manufacturer cannot be held liable for the crime. The law arose after victims, cities and states started to bring lawsuits against gunmakers that pursued new legal paths, such as one that argued manufacturers Glock Inc. and China North Industries had oversaturated the market, producing so many guns that it was inevitable some would fall into criminal hands. Most judges dismissed these kinds of lawsuits, but a minority allowed them to proceed. There are several situations that are not protected from lawsuits under the law. It does not protect gun dealers who transfer a gun knowing it would be used for criminal purposes, nor those who knowingly break state or federal law if the violation results in harm. Gun manufacturers can also be sued if the gun, when used properly, causes injury because the product is defective. Opponents argue that the law stops some victims from having their day in court because the liability immunity is so broad and ambiguous, while the exceptions are narrow. Supporters, though, say the law protects gun dealers and manufacturers from frivolous and expensive legal proceedings. We’ve written before that Congress has passed laws giving some other industries varying levels of immunity. A couple experts told us Clinton’s statement is unsound because the law sought to impose equivalent, rather than fewer, standards for gun makers that are already established for manufacturers of other products. As it stands, the victim of a crime committed with a toy — say, if a person seriously injured another person by shooting them with bb gun pellets — generally cannot sue the toy manufacturer, just as they can’t sue Toyota or Budweiser if they’re struck by a drunk person driving a Prius. The 2005 law ""basically put gun manufacturers in the same position that other product manufacturers are in,"" said Eugene Volokh, a law professor at the University of California Los Angeles. ""They’re responsible for defectively manufactured and designed products but not for failing to prevent criminal misuse of their products."" Additionally, toy guns and real guns pose fundamentally different risks because real guns are much more likely to be used in a crime than a toy gun, said Timothy Lytton, a Georgia State University law professor who edited a book on suing gun industry. So before the law, the gun industry was subject to a wider range of liability that just doesn’t apply to a toy. As such, it’s hard to imagine a realistic incident with a toy gun that would cause someone to bring a suit against the toy company, yet they would not be able to sue a gun manufacturer for an equivalent situation involving a real gun. A hypothetical situation might be if a city experienced an epidemic of deaths or injuries that resulted from a prevalence of realistic-looking toy guns; think of the recent story of Tamir Rice, a Cleveland child carrying a toy gun who a police officer shot and killed, said Alexandra Lahav, a professor of civil procedure at the University of Connecticut School of Law. In that case, a city might want to bring a suit against the toy gun manufacturer or seller for creating a public nuisance. But under the 2005 law, a city cannot sue a gun company if there is an epidemic of people being injured or killed by their guns. Lahav added, though, that she thinks the idea someone would bring a suit like this against a toy company is highly unlikely. In theory, there might be a liability gap between toy guns and real guns, but that wouldn't necessarily play out in reality, she said. Toy and real gun manufactures can be sued for product defects that cause injury when the product is used as intended. But if an injury is caused by a product defect coupled with a criminal misuse of the product, a toy gun manufacturer could be held liable, but a real gun manufacturer could not under the 2005 law, said Adam Winkler, also a UCLA law professor and an expert in the Second Amendment. That limits the gun industry’s incentives to make their products as safe as possible. The fact that a party cannot even attempt to bring these kinds of lawsuits against real gun manufacturers sets them apart from other industries, including toys, said Mark Geistfeld, a law professor at New York University and an expert in products liability. Such lawsuits against the gun industry might be destined to fail, but the 2005 law doesn’t even allow for the arguments to be tested. ""You’ve granted an immunity to the gun industry that you haven’t granted to any other industry,"" Geistfeld said of Sanders, noting that this supports the gist of Clinton’s point: that Sanders holds guns to a lower standard. Lytton noted, though, that he would not presume to know whether Sanders would grant similar immunity to the toy industry if the opportunity arose. ""It’s not fair to basically enter into hyperbole that somehow he treated firearms differently he would come down harder on toy guns,"" Lytton said. Consumer safety votes We also wanted to note another piece of evidence the Clinton campaign sent us to show that Sanders supports higher standards for toy guns. They pointed to Sanders’ congressional votes in favor of the 1993 Child Safety Protection Act and the 2008 Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act, both of which became law. These bills dealt with things like putting warning labels on toys with choking hazards, increasing civil penalties on companies that produce defective products, and limiting lead in toys. Experts told us that these votes do not have any impact on Clinton’s argument one way or another because they are about product safety regulations, which are a totally different ballgame than tort law and product liability. Though he thinks Clinton’s claim is on point because of the points discussed earlier, Geistfeld called these votes a red herring. ""You don’t have to love that (2005) law to see that it’s a very different thing,"" said Lahav of the University of Connecticut. ""I would have never thought to compare these things."" Our ruling Clinton said Sanders ""wants higher standards for toy guns than real guns."" Clinton points to the fact that Sanders voted in favor of a 2005 law granting the gun industry certain immunity from lawsuits. In her camp are scholars who believe the law made the gun industry less susceptible to liability than other industries, including the toy gun industry. But other scholars think the law made the gun industry’s liability about the same as that of a toy gun manufacturer. And because real guns carry so much more risk for injury than toy guns, it’s hard to compare them effectively.   This is a complex legal question, on which reasonable minds can disagree",Half True,"April 8, 2016"
"Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland ""voted to uphold"" D.C.’s ban on handguns.","Gun rights are ""hanging by a thread,"" Republican Party of Virginia chairman John Whitbeck wrote recently in an email urging the rejection of U.S. Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland. ""When Justice Antonin Scalia wrote his watershed opinion in D.C. v. Heller, it marked the first time that an individual right to keep and bear arms was recognized by the Supreme Court by a razor thin 5-4 vote,"" Whitbeck wrote. ""Now President (Barack) Obama is attempting to replace Justice Scalia with Judge Merrick Garland, an avowed opponent of our Second Amendment rights. While Justice Scalia voted to overturn D.C.’s draconian gun laws, Judge Garland voted to uphold them,"" the chairman added, emphasizing the second sentence with bold type. Whitbeck concluded his email by asking Republicans to sign an Internet petition telling Virginia’s U.S. senators - Democrats Mark Warner and Tim Kaine - that Merrick ""must not be confirmed to the Supreme Court!"" Scalia, who died Feb. 13, did write the majority opinion in the Supreme Court’s landmark 2008 ruling on District of Columbia vs. Heller. By a 5-4 vote, the high court found that Washington’s gun regulations - essentially amounting to a ban on handguns in the home - were unconstitutional. This Truth-O-Meter will focus on Whitbeck’s claim that Garland, who has been a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit since 1997, ""voted to uphold"" the handgun ban. A number of conservative organizations and individuals, including Fox News commentator Bill O’Reilly, have made similar statements.   The D.C. law  The Supreme Court’s decision in Heller was significant because it was the first time justices ruled that the Second Amendment guarantees an individual’s right to own a firearm for self-defense. Until Heller, the widespread understanding was that the right to bear arms did not necessarily extend beyond militia service. Before the case went to the Supreme Court, though, it was heard in the federal appeals court where Garland serves. In a 2-1 decision, a panel of D.C. appeals judges came to the same conclusion as the Supreme Court: The Washington handgun ban was unconstitutional. Based on Whitbeck’s claim, one might assume that the single dissenting vote in this D.C. Circuit opinion belonged to Garland. However, it was Judge Karen Henderson who dissented, while Judges Laurence Silberman and Thomas Griffith signed the majority opinion. Garland didn’t vote on the case at all. He was not part of the three-judge panel that heard it. After the D.C. Circuit handed down its 2007 decision, the city of Washington asked the court to rehear the case en banc, meaning all of the court’s judges would reconsider the case and not just the three-judge panel. The court ended up denying the city’s petition, but Garland was among the group of D.C. Circuit judges who voted to rehear the case. It’s misleading to say Garland supported the Washington gun regulations because he wanted to reconsider Heller, as he did not take a formal position on the merits of the case. Rehearing a case en banc is generally used when a case goes against precedent or presents a question of significant importance, and that was true of the Heller case. D.C. Circuit Judge A. Raymond Randolph, a well-known conservative, joined Garland in voting to reconsider the case. And the George W. Bush administration, though supportive of the notion that the Second Amendment protects individual gun rights, filed an amicus brief asking the Supreme Court to send Heller back to the lower court for broader definition - for example, what type of gun-ownership restrictions should remain constitutional.   ""Garland voted for his court to consider the constitutionality of D.C.'s law,"" Adam Winkler, a Second Amendment law expert at the University of California Los Angeles Law School, recently told PolitiFact National when it was fact-checking a statement by O’Reilly. ""Such a vote does not tell us one way or another how Garland feels about the Second Amendment."" Our ruling Whitbeck said Garland ""voted to uphold"" D.C.’s ban on handguns. Garland never heard the case about Washington’s gun law from the bench. It was ruled unconstitutional by a panel of three other judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, where Garland serves. Garland voted in favor of having the full court reconsider the case en banc - not an unusual step when a major decision bucks precedent. Randolph, a conservative judge on the appeals court who didn’t sit on the three-member panel, also voted to have the decision reconsidered en banc. It’s simply inaccurate to say Garland’s vote to reconsider the case is tantamount to a vote to uphold D.C.’s gun restriction or to extrapolate from it the nominee’s position on the case",False,"April 4, 2016"
"""According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 120 Americans on average die from a drug overdose every day. Overall, drug overdose deaths now outnumber deaths from firearms.""","In a recent Medium post, Rep. Joe Pitts, R-Pa., lamented the toll of addiction in his state and across the country. ""According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 120 Americans on average die from a drug overdose every day,"" Pitts wrote. ""Overall, drug overdose deaths now outnumber deaths from firearms."" We wondered whether those numbers were accurate, so we took a closer look. The CDC calculates overdose deaths from prescription drugs separately from overdose deaths from illicit drugs. To get the full number, you have to add both categories together. In 2014, there were 25,760 deaths from prescription-drug overdoses.  That same year, there were 17,465 deaths from illicit drugs, including heroin and cocaine.   The agency does not track overdoses from every illicit drug, so this accounting may understate the full number. Still, it provides a baseline. And if you add together the overdose deaths from prescription and illicit drugs, the sum is 43,225 overdose deaths. Then, if you divide that by 365 days, it works out to more than 118 overdose deaths a day, or just shy of the 120-per-day figure that Pitts cited. That’s close enough for us. We should note that the category of total overdoses includes accidental deaths, homicides, suicides and deaths of undetermined intent. So how do the number of deaths from drug overdoses compare with the number of deaths from firearms? According to CDC, there were 33,599 deaths caused by firearms in 2014. That includes homicides, suicides, legal interventions, accidents and cases of undetermined intentions. So in 2014, there were indeed more overdose deaths (43,225) than there were deaths from firearms (33,599), making Pitts’ second claim correct. Our ruling Pitts said that ""according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 120 Americans on average die from a drug overdose every day. Overall, drug overdose deaths now outnumber deaths from firearms."" Pitts is very close on the first part, and he’s correct on the second",True,"March 21, 2016"

""But he voted to keep the guns away. Just that vote, and you must know this, alienates most in the Republican Party, so they never would vote to confirm him."" A few conservative groups and figures have already attacked Garland for his position on guns since his nomination. We’re putting O’Reilly’s specific claim that Garland voted ""to keep guns away from private citizens"" on the Truth-O-Meter. D.C. gun ban O’Reilly’s statement refers to a landmark case on gun rights, District of Columbia vs. Heller. In its 2008 ruling, the Supreme Court found that Washington’s gun regulations — essentially amounting to a ban on handguns in the home — were unconstitutional. This ruling was significant because it was the first time the court held that the Second Amendment guarantees an individual’s right to own a firearm for self defense.

""Garland voted for his court to consider the constitutionality of D.C.'s law,"" Winkler said. ""Such a vote does not tell us one way or another how Garland feels about the Second Amendment."" We should also note another case, which some critics say indicates that Garland has a left-leaning opinion of the Second Amendment. In 2000, he joined the majority opinion in a 2-1 finding that the FBI could hold on to gun purchase records for six months for auditing purposes, to make sure the instant background check systems worked. The National Rifle Association called the six-month record retention an ""illegal national registration of gun owners,"" while the court found that it was a common-sense auditing system, not a national firearm registry, according to news reports from the time. Our ruling O’Reilly said Merrick Garland ""voted, so the folks know, in Washington, D.C., to keep guns away from private citizens.""

"""Gun violence is by far the leading cause of death for young African American men, outstripping the next nine causes of death combined.""","In a speech posted on Medium, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton offered a striking statistic about gun violence and minority youth. ""Gun violence,"" she wrote, ""is by far the leading cause of death for young African-American men, outstripping the next nine causes of death combined."" We wondered whether this is correct, so we took a closer look. We found the relevant data on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website. Using this search form, we collected data on the 10 most common causes of death for African-American men and boys between the ages of 15 and 24, for 2014.   Rank Cause of death Number of deaths Number gun-related 1st Homicide 2,416 2,256 2nd Unintentional injuries 1,135 47 3rd Suicide 448 230 4th Heart disease 172 -- 5th Cancer 161 -- 6th HIV 52 -- 7th Chronic lower respiratory diseases 47 -- 8th Congenital anomalies 38 -- 9th Anemia 33 -- 10th Diabetes 33 -- Total, 2nd through 9th place -- 2,119 -- So even if you look only at gun-related homicides, there were 2,256 of those in 2014, compared to 2,119 deaths in the next nine categories combined. This makes Clinton’s statement correct. If you add in the accidents and suicides related to guns, the gap between gun-related deaths and other types of deaths expands even further. There were 2,533 gun-related deaths in all 10 categories combined, compared to 2,002 deaths in the top 10 categories that had nothing to do with guns. We should note that this statement is dependent on the age range chosen. For instance, the statement is not correct for African-American boys between age 10 and 14. There were 38 gun-related homicides in that age and racial group in 2014, plus 10 gun suicides and three unintentional injuries caused by guns, for a total of 51. By contrast, the top 10 causes of death for that age and racial group included 271 deaths that had nothing to do with guns, such as diseases. That said, we think Clinton’s definition of ""young"" as 15-24 is a reasonable one. Our ruling Clinton said, ""Gun violence is by far the leading cause of death for young African-American men, outstripping the next nine causes of death combined.""

The rate of U.S. female homicide victims outnumbers 24 other developed countries by more than 2½ to 1.,"We see a lot of statistics about the murder rate in the United States, particularly as part of the debate over gun control. But a Facebook meme making the rounds is contending that the homicide rate for American women is more than two and a half times higher that it is for other developed countries. A reader in Utah pointed us to the meme on the page of a group called Everytown for Gun Safety, whose web page lists former New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg as a member of the advisory board. The reader wondered if it was accurate. We did, too.  Posted March 8, the meme reports the rates of female homicide for 25 countries. The United States' is 1.54 per 100,000 women. That's just over 2½ times the rate for the second-ranked country, Switzerland, whose rate is listed as 0.61 per 100,000. The chart does not list a source. First, a few things to note about the meme. Although Everytown is an anti-gun violence group, the meme mentions nothing about weapons. The legend at the bottom simply says the chart is listing murder rates. Also, because the headline on the meme talks about ""America's Deadly Domestic Violence Problem,"" it's not clear if the group is talking about all causes of homicide or just domestic violence homicide. The answer turns out to be neither. Erika Soto Lamb, a spokeswoman for the group, said the data come from a 2002 paper in the Journal of the American Medical Women's Association that used World Health Organization statistics on female murder rates — both gun related and non-gun related — from 1994 to 1999. The data in the Everytown meme are the rates for gun homicides, not all homicides. The rates were from 25 populous high-income countries. But when you look at all homicides — which the chart claims to be measuring — the rates are different. The United States was still No. 1, with 3.21 murders per 100,000 women during the 1990s. But the United States was not as far ahead of the rest of the pack. The rate was 1.7 times higher than No. 2 Finland and about 2.4 times higher than the countries in third, fourth and fifth place, which were Switzerland, Belgium and New Zealand respectively. ""The U.S. female homicide victimization rate was 5 times higher than the rate for the other high-income countries combined,"" said the researchers, led by David Hemenway, director of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center. More recent data When we contacted Hemenway seeking newer data, he sent us a November 2015 paper done with Erin Grinshteyn of the University of Nevada-Reno, which found that the U.S. homicide rate was 7 times higher than 23 other high-income countries — 25 times higher if you only look at gun deaths. But the paper offers no breakdown by gender. It used 2010 mortality data from the World Health Organization. We contacted Grinshteyn directly, and she sent us the 2010 rates for women in more detail. We've put it in chart form.  Newer homicide estimates are available in a WHO report released in 2014. They show a similar pattern. In that ranking, female murder rates in the United States in 2012 were much higher than 22 other countries. Finland and Belgium ranked second and third, at 1.3 each, but the difference is not as dramatic as the Everytown Facebook chart. The report did not compile rates for female gun deaths. Lamb also said the group was in the process of fixing the chart, which had been shared 1,869 times when we last checked. Our ruling Everytown for Gun Safety produced a chart showing that the rate of U.S. female homicides outnumbers the rates in 24 other developed countries by more than 2½ to 1. But the rates in the chart are for gun-related homicides, not all homicides. Nor are they the rates for domestic violence deaths among women, contrary to the headline on the chart. Finally, the data are about two decades out of date. The relationship that caught our eye — female homicides being 2½ times more common than other developed countries — is not as extreme, according to the latest estimates, although the United States is clearly far ahead of other developed countries.

If we can ban handguns, we will do it,"" the post quotes Clinton as telling the Register on Aug. 8, 2015. But here’s the thing: The quote is wholly fabricated. Clinton was never quoted in the Register making that statement, and it appears she has not made such a statement anywhere else. Clinton campaigned heavily in Iowa throughout the summer and fall of 2015, and Register reporters and the paper’s editorial board interviewed her several times. But she was not in Iowa on Aug. 8, when she allegedly made the statement. Clinton’s first visit to Iowa in the month of August occurred on Aug. 14, followed by public events on Aug. 15 and Aug. 26. A review of the Register’s archives show Clinton was neither interviewed nor quoted directly on Aug. 8 or in the days immediately following. Clinton did make several statements regarding gun control on the Iowa campaign trail that were covered by the Register. In all of them, she laid out an agenda that calls for broader background-check requirements, including sales at gun shows, as well as stronger measures to prevent gun purchases by domestic abusers and people with serious mental health problems. ""I'm going to speak out against the uncontrollable use of guns in our country because I believe we can do better than that,"" Clinton said in Iowa in July. ""A majority of Americans and a majority of gun owners agree with universal background checks to keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers and people who are mentally unstable and even terrorists."" On Aug. 26 in Ankeny, she responded to the on-air murders of a news crew in Virginia: ""We've got to do something. It's a very difficult political issue. But we are smart enough, compassionate enough to balance legitimate Second Amendment rights concerns with preventive measures and control measures, so whatever motivated this murderer ... we will not see more needless, senseless deaths,"" she said. She went on,  ""If guns weren't so readily available, if we had universal background checks, if we could put some time out between the person who got fired, or domestic abuse, or whatever other motivation ... maybe we could prevent this kind of carnage."" On Oct. 6, she described her views again, in response to a mass shooting in Oregon: ""I feel like this is unfinished business in our country, and I am very determined that we are going to try to bring some sanity back, so that people's Second Amendment rights are protected — but they are not absolute, the way the NRA wants them to be,"" Clinton said at an event in Davenport. ""There are common-sense ways to make sure people are not using guns to commit mass murders."" Gun control came up again at an event in Sioux City on Dec. 4, after the mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif. At that time, she expressed support for banning gun sales to people on federal ""no-fly"" lists. ""I think we've got to be more willing to start imposing these kinds of gun-safety measures,"" Clinton said. ""I'm certainly going to continue advocating for them."" Internet searches for the quote found on the image refer only to the image itself — not to any original reporting from the Des Moines Register, another news outlet or to raw audio or video.

"""Over 32,000 people die from #GunViolence every year. Yet, (The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) is banned from researching ways to prevent this.""","While Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin is not up for re-election until 2018, she’s still engaging in at least one of the biggest issues in the 2016 campaign. In January, she co-sponsored legislation to appropriate $10 million to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention over the next five years for firearm research. To promote her legislation, Baldwin tweeted this on Jan. 24, 2015, citing limits on what the CDC can do: ""Over 32,000 people die from #GunViolence every year. Yet, @CDCgov is banned from researching ways to prevent this."" We wondered if Baldwin was right. Gun violence numbers As backup for the statistic that 32,000 people die from gun violence every year, Baldwin’s team pointed to the CDC’s National Vital Statistics database. It’s the most comprehensive source for national statistics as it is a census, pulling information from death certificates.   The report shows that in 2013, the latest year for which data is available, there were 33,636 gun-related deaths. Beyond that, from 2009-2013, an average of 32,100 people died each year from gun-related injuries. So Baldwin is on target with the number. About one third of gun-related deaths are homicides, with suicides counting for about two thirds of deaths. PolitiFact Texas examined a similar claim from presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton in October 2015: ""We lose an average of 90 Americans every day because of guns."" This claim was backed up by taking the number of firearm deaths tallied by the CDC in 2013 and averaging it out over a year. Clinton hit the number, but didn’t mention that most of those deaths are suicides, not homicides. Her claim was rated Mostly True. Dickey amendment In the second part of her claim, Baldwin said the CDC is ""banned from researching ways to prevent"" gun violence. Her tweet linked to a news release that pointed to a 1996 piece of legislation as evidence. The news release said, in part: ""Currently, a Republican appropriations rider from 1996 prohibits funding for such critical research at the CDC, even though the original rider’s author, former Republican Jay Dickey, has since announced his opposition to it noting that the rider’s intention was to prevent the CDC from lobbying for gun control, not from conducting gun-violence research.""   This 1996 rider is commonly called the Dickey Amendment. In the early 1990s, the New England Journal of Medicine published research that concluded gun ownership, independent of other factors, increased the risk for a homicide in the home. The study was funded by the CDC’s National Center for Injury Prevention and Control. In the wake of the research, and subsequent media attention, the National Rifle Association campaigned for the elimination of the injury prevention center. While the center survived, new language in the 1996 budget bill said that ""none of the funds made available for injury prevention and control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may be used to advocate or promote gun control."" In some ways the statement was redundant, as general funding cannot be used for advocacy. Congress also took from the CDC’s budget $2.6 million -- the exact amount invested in firearm injury research the previous year. While the language against advocating and promoting gun control did not explicitly ban the CDC from researching gun violence, the CDC stopped the work anyway. Linda Degutis, the former director of the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, said the action by Congress sent a strong message to the CDC.   ""Even though that language doesn’t say research is prohibited,"" Degutis said, ""everyone who was making decisions interpreted it to mean that you could not do any research on gun violence.""   The language, and lack of funding, has carried on in spending bills and even been expanded to the National Institute of Health, another agency in the Department of Health and Human Services. ""It is the equivalent of a ban,"" said David Hemenway, director of the Injury Control Research Center at Harvard University. ""It’s a touch more nuanced than a ban, but there’s basically no real difference in terms of research."" In the wake of mass shootings in 2013, President Barack Obama requested the CDC be granted new funding to study gun violence. Congress did not appropriate the funds. Our rating Baldwin said ""over 32,000 people die from #GunViolence every year. Yet, @CDCgov is banned from researching ways to prevent this."" The most comprehensive data available supports the first part of the claim, that more than 32,000 people die from gun violence every year. On the research ban, while the language from the Dickey Amendment does not explicitly ban the agency from conducting research, its interpretation effectively banned the practice",Mostly True,"March 9, 2016"
"""Every year there is a slightly smaller percentage of American households owning guns.""","There’s a bottom-line reason why the National Rifle Association doesn’t want to broaden background checks on gun buyers, former President Bill Clinton said during a recent rally in Richmond for his wife’s presidential campaign. ""The NRA and the gun manufacturers know that every year there is a slightly smaller percentage of American households owning guns,"" Clinton, a Democrat, said during the Feb. 24 speech at the Hippodrome theater.   ""So what they have to do every time somebody says ‘Would you please give us three days to do a background check and maybe a little more if we don’t have consolidated mental health records’ … they go nuts and say, ‘Well this is the beginning of the end. They’re violating the Second Amendment. They’re coming after your gun.’"" We wondered whether Clinton was correct that, every year, there’s a slow and steady decline in the proportion of households that own guns. The former president’s spokesman, Angel Urena, pointed us to one article on The Huffington Post and another in The New York Times about gun ownership. Both items focused on findings about gun ownership in polls conducted by the General Social Survey at the University of Chicago. Since 1973, the survey has asked people whether anyone in their home owns a gun. The results show that the high-water mark was in 1977, when 50.4 percent of households had firearms. Since then, the survey found there’s been a long-term decline in the percentage of households with guns, which dropped to 31 percent in 2014 - the latest survey available. The decline largely occurred during the 1990s. Researchers say much of the long-term decline was caused by a drop in the popularity of hunting. But contrary to Clinton’s claim, the percentage of households possessing firearms hasn’t decreased every year. Since 2000, the percentage has been fairly static, bobbing slightly up and down. Here’s what the survey has found in its more recent polls. Keep in mind the survey is conducted every two years. The figures show the percentage of households with guns: •2000;  32.4 percent •2002:  33.5 percent •2004:  34.7 percent •2006:  33.1 percent •2008:  34 percent •2010:  31.1 percent •2012:  33.1 percent •2014:  31 percent   Gun rights advocates have criticized the survey’s gun ownership number as being too low. The NRA estimates that 40 percent to 45 percent of households have guns. Gallup also has been surveying household gun ownership for decades but comes up with different percentages and a different long-term trend than the General Social Survey. Unlike the General Social Survey, it finds almost no long-term decrease in gun-owning households: It was 43 percent in the 1972 and 41 percent last year. In between, the roller coaster trend line constantly rises and falls. The pattern essentially holds up if you look at recent years: 41 percent of households owned guns in 2000 and in 2015. In between, there are many peaks and valleys. Let’s look at one last series of polls on household gun ownership by the Pew Research Center. It found that 45 percent of households owned a gun in 1993, and that decreased to 33 percent in 2013 - the last year Pew surveyed on the question. But as with the other polls, the decrease is barely discernable when starting at 2000. That year, 35 percent of households had firearms. Fast forward to 2013, when it was 33 percent. In between those two years, the percentages once again bob up and down. How should we take all these confusing poll results? Perhaps with a grain of salt. Pew said in a March 2013 report that there’s ""no definitive data source from the government or elsewhere on how many Americans own guns or how gun ownership rates have changed over time. Also, public opinion surveys provide conflicting results: Some show a decline in the number of households with guns, but another does not."" Our ruling Bill Clinton says ""every year there is a slightly smaller percentage of American households owning guns."" Although polls on gun-owning households are erratic, you can make a plausible argument they show a long-range downward trend. Clinton cites a series of surveys by the University of Chicago that show a drop of 19 percentage points since the early 1970s. Another set of polls by Gallup show the five-decade drop is 2 percentage points. A third series of polls by Pew shows a decrease of 12 percentage points since 1993. But much of the downward movement occurred in the 1990s, and Clinton goes overboard by saying the percentage is going down ""every year."" All three surveys show the yearly percentages have been fluctuating in recent years and that, since 2000, the drop is about 1 or 2 percentage points",Half True,"March 7, 2016"
"Says he supported the 1994 crime bill because ""there is a ban on assault weapons in that bill.""","Bernie Sanders defended his vote supporting the 1994 crime bill during an interview on Meet the Press. Both he and Hillary Clinton have been criticized for their support of the legislation, which some say helped usher in the era of mass incarceration and decimate black communities. Sanders has pushed back, saying he only voted for the bill because of key safety provisions. The Sanders campaign offered the defense when we asked about it in September and in a recent press release. But that doesn’t add up, Meet the Press’ Chuck Todd pointed out on Feb. 28. ""You said you supported the House version of crime bill because it had an assault weapons ban in it. But that turned out not to be the case,"" Todd said. ""So why did you put out a statement that was misleading?"" ""Woah, woah, woah,"" Sanders responded. ""No, that’s not my understanding. My understanding is there is a ban on assault weapons in that bill."" ""It was not in the House bill that you voted. It was in a Senate bill, but not the House bill,"" Todd countered. ""Hold it. To the best of my knowledge, there were two important provisions, and that is the Violence Against Women Act,"" Sanders said. ""And my understanding is there is a ban on assault weapons."" So who’s right here? The answer is complicated. Sanders did vote in favor of a House conference report that included the aforementioned ban and protections for women. He also voted for a separate House bill specifically prohibiting assault weapons that was meant to be folded into the omnibus legislation. But it’s a stretch to say that Sanders supported the crime bill because of the assault weapons ban, so Todd is right that Sanders also okayed versions without the prohibitions. Sanders and the crime bill The crime bill underwent many iterations before it became law in August 1994. So it’s not entirely clear if Sanders and Todd are talking about the same version. But here’s the bottom line. Sanders voted for at least one version of the bill that didn’t include the assault weapons ban -- undercutting his core claim. The crime bill had a circuitous path. In 1991, Sanders opposed the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1991 — an early version of the 1994 bill put forth by Jack Brooks, a Democrat from Texas and the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. Though the bill passed in the House, it ultimately failed in the Senate. In October 1993, Brooks tried again and introduced the original Violent Crime and Control Law Enforcement Act of 1994. This version didn’t include an assault weapons ban nor protections for women. It passed in the House by a voice vote on Nov. 3, 1993, so it’s unclear whether Sanders voted in favor. We found no evidence Sanders opposed the bill, and in three roll call votes, Sanders, along with most Democrats, said ""aye"" to amendments that didn’t include a ban. When the bill reached the Senate, it added provisions to ban assault weapons and protect women from crimes such as sexual assault and domestic violence. This version passed in the Senate and returned to the House. At that point, two things happened. First, Sanders criticized the crime bill for its lack of attention to root causes. ""We can either educate or electrocute. We can create meaningful jobs, rebuilding our society, or we can build more jails. Mr. Speaker, let us create a society of hope and compassion, not one of hate and vengeance,"" he said on the House floor on April 13. Second, Brooks amended the bill again, this time stripping the legislation of the assault weapons ban but keeping the violence against women provisions. Sanders voted for the bill without the gun ban. In place of the ban, Brooks offered to create a commission to ""examine the extent to which assault weapons and high power firearms have contributed to violence and murder in the United States."" Then the bill went back and forth between the two chambers for a few months, as a conference committee attempted to hash out the differences. Meanwhile, the assault weapons ban became a hot topic in the national debate, with three former presidents — Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan — writing a letter urging Congress to pass it. In May, Sanders voted for a separate bill put forth by New York Sen. Chuck Schumer to ban 19 semi-automatic assault weapons, including AK-47s and Uzis as well as weapons with more than one assault feature. According to news reports from the time, passing this legislation paved the way for the compromise bill to encompass the ban. Brooks, the Texas Democrat described by the Washington Post as ""wily and contrary,"" attempted to keep the prohibitions out of the bill but to no avail. The House released its conference report in August 1994 with the ban in place. Sanders voted in agreement.   Sanders on banning assault weapons Outside of the omnibus crime bill, the record shows that Sanders supported prohibiting assault weapons since his early days in office. In 1990, the Miami Herald noted that Sanders had earned the backing of the gun community in his congressional bid over Republican Peter Smith, even though ""Sanders also supports federal limits on assault weapons."" But in 1994, his vote on the Schumer bill roused the ire of Vermont gun owners. Here’s a passage from the Boston Globe to that point: ""Sanders, who always supported an assault weapons ban, joined Swett and Andrews in the 216-214 House majority to ban 19 types of semiautomatic guns — which require the trigger to be pulled each time the gun is fired but have high rates of fire and magazines that hold more than 10 cartridges. ‘We're going to put our complete and entire effort to unseat him,’ said Douglas Hoffman, president of a pro-gun group, the Sportsman's Alliance for Vermont's Environment, of Sanders."" In 1996, Sanders reconfirmed his support of the ban, voting to reject its appeal. Our ruling Sanders says he voted for the 1994 crime bill because ""there is a ban on assault weapons in that bill."" There were many votes surrounding the crime bill. The trouble with Sanders’ claim is that his contention that he voted for the crime bill because of the assault weapons ban is at odds with votes for the bill that include no such ban. As often with congressional votes, there is a lot of gray area to determining a legislator’s motivations",Half True,"February 28, 2016"
"""So far in 2015, there have been more mass shootings than days."""," Editor's Note: We’ve received questions about our Mostly False rating on this fact check, with some saying we relied on a definition of mass shooting that’s too limited. As we stated in the fact check, there is no legal definition for this act of violence. We agree there’s room for interpretation about how many deaths or injuries should constitute a mass shooting. And we’ve added the perspective of gun control advocates to this fact check to convey that sentiment. We maintain, however, that the statements we fact checked used the most overly broad definition of this type of crime, a definition that goes beyond what the average person would consider a mass shooting.   What is a mass shooting? There’s no legal definition. But a key congressional report defines it as a shooting that kills four or more people. Think Columbine. Virginia Tech. San Bernardino. From 1999 through 2013, there were about 21 mass shootings each year in the United States, according to a congressional analysis of FBI data. Roughly four took place annually in public settings, like at schools, restaurants or workplaces. Another 17, on average, took place in private homes or other locations. More recent FBI data was not available. But recent claims by California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom and state Sen. Richard Pan say hundreds of mass shootings took place —  in 2015 alone. ""So far in 2015, there have been more mass shootings than days,"" Newsom said in a Dec. 5, 2015 email promoting a gun control initiative he’s introduced. Newsom references the San Bernardino mass shooting in his email. That attack killed 14 people, injured 22 others and took place on Dec. 2, 2015. Pan added in a press release on Jan. 19, 2016 that ""there were more mass shootings in America where four or more people were killed, than there were days in the year in 2015."" We wondered: Did mass shootings in America somehow skyrocket from about 20 annually to more than 300 overnight? Or were Newsom and Pan using a definition of this kind of crime that reflects a different view of reality? Newsom is running for California governor in 2018. He has introduced a gun control initiative for the November ballot that would require most Californians to pass background checks to purchase ammunition. Pan, who represents the Sacramento region, recently proposed legislation that would require the state to track gun deaths. Both are Democrats. Newsom’s claim Let’s dive into the lieutenant governor’s statement first. He made the claim that there had been more mass shootings than days in 2015 on Dec. 5, or day 339 that year. Representatives for Newsom and the Courage Campaign said the politician, in making his claim, relied on news reports that cited gun violence tracking websites, including what was until recently known as ‘Mass Shooting Tracker.’ That website, now known as ‘Gun Violence Archive,’ used crowd-sourced information and a much broader definition of mass shooting than the congressional report. It counted mass shootings as any incident, anywhere, in which at least four people were shot, but not necessarily killed. By early December 2015, Mass Shooting Tracker reported there had been 353 mass shootings in America so far that year. Criminologists told us the website’s broad definition lumps in more shooting categories, such as gang-related crimes or robberies, than typically associated with mass shootings. Several said this is purposely done to inflate the statistics. David Kopel is a professor at Denver University’s Sturm College of Law. He has written several books from a gun rights perspective. ""The problem with the way Gavin Newsom is using this pseudo data is it’s out of context and is done in a way which is calculated to cause confusion,"" Kopel said. ""When people hear the term mass shootings, I think what they think of are things like the San Bernardino attacks or the Newtown crime. … By that definition, the number is far, far smaller.""   Gun control advocates say there’s no good reason to require that four people die before calling a crime a mass shooting. Using that threshold, they point out, would mean a February shooting in Kansas in which three people were killed and 14 were injured would not be considered a mass shooting. ""It is arbitrary to distinguish between a death and an injury,"" said Ari Freilich, staff attorney at the San Francisco-based Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. ""We shouldn’t have to be waiting outside a hospital room to see if the victim is going cling to life to call it a mass shooting."" Freilich said the definition for a mass shooting should be an incident in which a dangerous person is able to shoot four or more other people, regardless of whether anyone is killed.  State Sen. Richard Pan, D-Sacramento, left, talks with fellow lawmakers at the Capitol. Associated Press file photo. Pan’s claim State Sen. Richard Pan's claim was ""there were more mass shootings in America where four or more people were killed, than there were days in the year in 2015."" When contacted by PolitiFact California, a spokeswoman for Pan said the press release from the senator’s office mistakenly omitted the full definition used by the shooting tracker website. She then issued a new press release with Pan quoted as saying a mass shooting is defined as four or more people ""shot or killed."" Pan relied on news reports that cited the shooting tracker website to back up his claim, the senator’s spokeswoman said. Again, the experts told us, that website tracked far more than what would be considered mass shootings. ""Once you drill down through the data, you find that there are very different particular reasons for those shootings, or for those injuries,"" said Ryan Getty, a professor of criminal justice at Sacramento State University. Getty said the data might be derived from a family shot ""trying to defend their home against home invaders."" But, instead, ""people just assume that it’s events like what happened in San Bernardino."" As PolitiFact Florida reported, ""Politicians or others who want to make a point about guns choose a set of data and a definition that reinforces the point they want to make. People who want more gun control tend to choose more expansive definitions."" ""Those who want to create a sense of crisis over the violence will tend to use lower cutoffs, while those who want to minimize the problem will use higher cutoffs,"" Gary Kleck, a criminology professor at Florida State University, told PolitiFact Florida, which evaluated a similar mass shooting statement. William Krouse of the Congressional Research Service authored the report ""Mass Murder with Firearms: Incidents and Victims, 1999-2013."" That’s the report that shows about 21 mass shootings took place per year, using the stricter definition of at least four people killed. Krouse said federal data for the past two years is not widely available. But, he added, USA Today’s tracking of this type of crime is the best available. It shows 18 mass shootings took place in 2014 and 25 last year. Our ruling Following the shooting in San Bernardino that killed 14 people and injured 22, California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom and state Sen. Richard Pan claimed that hundreds of mass shootings took place in 2015. They used an extremely broad definition of mass shooting — one that includes incidents in which people are shot but no one is necessarily killed. A key congressional report defines a mass shooting as an incident in which four or more people are killed. Criminologists say this definition is more in line with events like the shootings at Columbine, Virginia Tech or in San Bernardino. As we said at the beginning, there is no legal definition for a mass shooting. The California politicians chose a broad definition by using a crowd-sourced website that better fits their gun control goals",Mostly False,"February 23, 2016"
"""Under Virginia law, if you are a non-federally licensed (gun) dealer, you cannot get a background check even if you want one.""","Gov. Terry McAuliffe says Virginia’s law requiring background checks on prospective gun buyers would be substantially broadened under a bipartisan agreement he’s struck  with the General Assembly. Virginia now requires federally licensed dealers - those in the business of selling firearms - to conduct computerized checks to see whether a buyer has a disqualifying criminal record or mental health history. But casual sales between individuals are exempt and that, the governor says, opens a loophole for guns to fall into the wrong hands. McAuliffe, a Democrat, is backing legislation that would position state police at Virginia gun shows to conduct voluntary background checks on the private sales. ""Under Virginia law, if you are a non-federally licensed dealer, you cannot get a background check even if you want one,"" McAuliffe said during a Feb. 3 interview with Mike Valerio of WWBT-TV in Richmond. ""We changed that law."" McAuliffe made a similar claim during a Feb. 1 interview on WJLA-TV in Washington. ""Even if the non-licensed dealer today wants to do a background check, he is prohibited by law,"" he said. Those claims and others by the governor were disputed in a full-page ad taken out in the Richmond Times-Dispatch on Feb. 9 by Everytown for Gun Safety, a national gun control group founded by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Everytown accuses McAuliffe, who promised in his 2013 campaign to seek background checks for all gun buyers, of backing weak reforms. The ad said ""voluntary background checks already exist"" for private sellers. So we decided to investigate whether the governor is right in saying that an unlicensed seller in Virginia - say, someone who wants to get rid of a rifle or a handgun he has at home - now is legally barred at a gun show from getting a background check on a potential buyer. Under state law, a person seeking to buy a firearm from a licensed dealer is required to fill out a form stating that he never has been convicted of a felony or adjudicated mentally incompetent and that he is not subject to a restraining order. The dealer forwards the information to the state police, which performs an ""instant background check"" and tells the dealer whether he can sell the gun to the customer. Virginia’s law allows only federally licensed dealers to contact the state police for the check. ""The private seller, they can’t even ask for a background check from the state police,"" Christina Nuckols, deputy press secretary for McAuliffe, told us on the phone. But that doesn’t mean a private seller is without recourse. He still can ask a licensed dealer to conduct a background check on the potential buyer but, if the dealer is willing,  it becomes a complicated process. Under state law, licensed dealers can do background checks only for the purchase of firearms that are in their inventory. A private seller seeking a background check could  convey his gun on consignment to a dealer, said Corinne Geller, public relations manager for the state police. That’s not an unusual occurrence, according to David Hathcock, manager of Bob Moates Sports Shop in Chesterfield County, a licensed dealer of firearms. ""Most people want to make sure their guns to wind up in good hands,"" he told us, adding ""At any given time, I have 50 to 100 guns on consignment"" in the store. Moates, however, only does business from his store. And McAuliffe, in his comments, was specifically referring to private sellers at gun shows being barred from getting a background check. We spoke to three Virginia dealers on Feb. 14 who  had tables set up at The Nation’s Gun Show in Chantilly. They all told us the governor’s statement is wrong and they are occasionally approached by a private seller and a buyer seeking a check. The dealers said they’ll run the background check for a fee -- usually $25 to $35 -- to compensate for the trouble of putting the gun in their inventory and storing the information for a required 20 years. ""We do it all the time; it’s absolutely legal,"" said Brian Parrish, owner of Triune Shooting Sports in Warrenton. He told us he gets an average ""one or two"" such requests at every gun show. Sonny Condon, owner on Sonny’s Guns & Transfers in Richmond, said it’s rare when he gets such a request from a private seller, ""but it does happen."" Jerry Cochran, owner of Trader Jerry’s in Tazewell County, said he only recently became aware that he could run a background check for a private seller. ""I’ve done five of them in the last month,"" he said. McAuliffe’s measure would streamline the procedure by allowing a private seller to go straight to the state police at a gun show to request a background check. But, as before, neither the seller nor the buyer would be required legally to seek the check. McAuliffe warns that a private seller who bypasses the new system could face increased liability if a gun he sold was used in a crime. Philip Van Cleave, president of the pro-gun Virginia Citizens Defense League, said he thinks more private sellers will seek background checks if the legislation passes, ""but it’s not going to be earth-shaking."" The bill, we should note, sailed through the House of Delegates on a 96-3 vote on Feb. 10 and now is pending in the Senate. Our ruling McAuliffe says, ""Under Virginia law, if you are a non-federally licensed (gun) dealer, you cannot get a background check even if you want one."" The law requires only licensed dealers - those in the business of selling guns - to conduct background checks on a prospective buyer. As such, only licensed dealers are allowed to contact the state police to request the check. A private seller has no direct access to the background-check process. That doesn’t mean a private seller determined to get a background check is out in the cold. He can ask a gun dealer to conduct the check for him. But that’s a messy process that requires a lot of paperwork and the private seller to temporarily convey his gun to the dealer. So McAuliffe misspeaks when he says the law prohibits the private seller from getting a background check. But the law does make it very difficult for the private seller - who is under no obligation to seek a background check - to get one",Mostly False,"February 15, 2016"
"""Gene Green is the NRA’s favorite Democrat in Congress. ... ""It’s no wonder the congressman has a lifetime A rating from the NRA.""","The Democratic race for Texas’ 29th Congressional district is turning to a hot-button issue: gun control. Gene Green, a Democrat, has represented Texas’ 29th District, which covers the eastern portion of Greater Houston, since 1993. In that time, he has been endorsed by the gun-owner rights group National Rifle Association several times and often received an A rating from the organization -- an issue his challenger, former Harris County Sheriff Adrian Garcia, is bringing to the fore in advance of the March 2016 Democratic primary. ""Gene Green is the NRA’s favorite Democrat in Congress,"" Garcia was quoted saying in his own Jan. 7, 2016, campaign media release. ""He’s part of the reason our president has had to use executive action to protect our people. When House Democrats reclaim a majority, the NRA will still have Gene Green in their pocket to block progressive gun safety measures. He is their insurance policy."" Garcia continued: ""It’s no wonder the congressman has a lifetime A rating from the NRA. He signed on to a letter with Texas Republicans to prevent the restriction of armor-piercing bullets. He voted against the Brady Bill, he's voted against child safety locks, and later voted for the assault weapons ban repeal. He also voted for keeping the gun show loophole."" There are a lot of specifics in Garcia’s claim, and we’ll get to those. We also wanted to check if Green has a ""lifetime A rating"" from the NRA and, although it’s harder to judge, if he could be the organization’s ""favorite Democrat."" Lifetime rating? Garcia claimed Green had a ""lifetime A rating"" from the NRA. The NRA doesn’t award lifetime ratings; it says it only evaluates candidates each election cycle. Still, candidates sometimes use the term ""lifetime rating"" to promote consistently high -- or low -- NRA marks. According to Jennifer Baker, the association’s director of public affairs, the NRA evaluates candidates by looking at voting records, public statements, plus what he or she is doing ""behind the scenes"" in committee. Baker said that if a hopeful hasn’t held office, the group primarily considers answers to survey questions. According to NRA’s website, its ratings range from A+ -- for a legislator with ""not only an excellent voting record on all critical NRA issues, but who has also made a vigorous effort to promote and defend the Second Amendment""-- to F, a ""true enemy of gun owners’ rights."" Other ratings include AQ, a pro-gun candidate who has no voting record and whose rating is based on answers to survey questions, and ""?,"" meaning a candidate didn’t answer the NRA’s questionnaire, inaction the organization takes as indicative of ""indifference, if not outright hostility,"" to gun owners’ rights. Notably for this fact check, ratings for past election cycles only are available to NRA members. Baker told us by phone that when the NRA endorses a candidate, the group ""actively informs our members of our preference in that race."" A candidate who has a high rating is not guaranteed to receive an endorsement, she said, and a candidate with a lower rating can sometimes be endorsed if the NRA thinks the opponent would be especially bad on its issues. We used an NRA member password and checked with the organization on ratings prior to 2002, which are not posted online at all, to verify Green’s record over the 24 years he’s run for election and re-election to Congress. He mostly received A-level ratings, but drew one C too: 1992: rated ""A"" and endorsed 1994: rated ""C,"" not endorsed 1996: rated ""A+"" and endorsed From 1998-2010: rated ""A"" and endorsed 2012: rated ""A-,"" not endorsed 2014: rated ""A-,"" not endorsed The NRA has not released ratings for the 2016 election cycle, and does not yet have an expected date for their release. So, what happened in 1994, and after 2012? In 1994, Green voted for the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, the sweeping crime bill signed by President Bill Clinton that included firearms control measures, Green told us by phone. ""I voted for the bill as part of a package, and that’s why the NRA for a couple years didn’t appreciate it,"" he said.   Green’s campaign spokesman, Jose Borjon, pointed out that the 1994 legislation included the federal assault weapons ban, which expired in 2004. The bill, we noted, also prohibited juvenile possession of a handgun, prohibited anyone convicted of domestic abuse from buying firearms or ammunition, increased penalties for crimes involving guns and added licensing and registration requirements for firearms dealers. Green suggested that between 2010 and 2012, when his rating slipped to an A- after more than 15 years of A’s, gun legislation became an even more partisan issue, and the NRA allied itself more with the Republican Party. As that happened, Green said, he did not want to be associated with the organization. However, his grade only declined from an A to an A-. A December 2012 Washington Post article that Green mentioned to us referenced his distancing from the NRA, at the time related to the NRA’s effort to get then-Attorney General Eric Holder held in contempt of Congress after the Sandy Hook school shootings in Newtown, Conn. He joined fellow gun-friendly Democrat John Dingell, the longtime Michigan representative who retired in 2014, in criticizing the group. In the same month, Green told reporters at Hearst’s Washington bureau that instead of passing new gun legislation, Congress needed ""to find better ways to enforce current law."" Voting record In Garcia’s release, the campaign offered background on the specific votes it referred to: -- The ""letter with Texas Republicans to prevent the restriction of armor-piercing bullets,"" Garcia’s campaign said, was Green’s June 3, 2015, ""yes"" vote for the Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies Appropriations Act. That act included an amendment prohibiting the use of funds to classify ammunition as armor piercing in imports. The letter itself is a March 4, 2015, letter signed by Green, Texas Republicans and others to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives opposing the agency’s proposed restrictions on armor-piercing bullets. -- Green, Garcia’s campaign said, voted in November 1993 against the Brady Bill, or the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, so named for James Brady, who was shot during an assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan. We checked, and Green did vote against the Brady Bill. -- Green’s vote ""against child safety locks,"" the Garcia campaign said, was his Sept. 24, 1999, ""no"" vote on a conference substitute for the Consequences for Juvenile Offenders Act. Green’s ""no"" vote was in response to a motion to instruct conferees, or a House vote to tell its conference committee members how to resolve an issue while negotiating a version of the bill between the House and the Senate. The issue at hand was a Senate amendment that required that child safety locks be sold with every handgun, among other regulations. Green voted no, to instruct committee members to reject that amendment. --Garcia’s reference to Green’s ""vote for the assault weapons ban repeal"" was Green’s March 22, 1996, ""yes"" vote for the Gun Crime Enforcement and Second Amendment Restoration Act. Green did vote for the legislation, which would have repealed the assault weapons ban that he earlier voted to put in place. --Green’s vote for ""keeping the gun show loophole"" was his June 18, 1999, ""no"" vote against the Mandatory Gun Show Background Check Act. Green, Garcia’s campaign said, voted against an amendment to regulate firearms transfers at gun shows and require criminal background checks to prevent the sale of guns to minors and felons. In response to these claims, Borjon, Green’s campaign spokesman, pointed out a few votes from Green’s tenure that tended toward gun control, including his 1994 vote in support of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act. Borjon also emphasized Green’s vote for the 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Acts, which included the Child Safety Lock Act. Green himself emphasized to us that he supported the bipartisan gun legislation authored by California Democrat Mike Thompson and New York Republican Peter King, the Public Safety and Second Amendment Rights Protection Act. When we asked about Green’s voting record and his current stance on gun legislation, Green’s campaign said he supported President Obama’s 2016 executive action on gun safety. ‘Favorite Democrat in Congress’ Garcia’s campaign release also referred to Green as the ""NRA’s favorite Democrat in Congress."" While that’s not a determination we can make, we looked at the current Democrats in Congress to see if like Green, any have garnered mostly high ratings and endorsements. Of the 232 Democrats in Congress as of early 2016, six had fielded A ratings from the NRA before their latest election. Four others, besides Green, had A- ratings. One was rated AQ. The ""A"" Democrats were: Rep. Sanford Bishop of Georgia, Sen. Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Reps. Collin Peterson and Tim Walz of Minnesota, Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Rep. Ron Kind of Wisconsin. Democrats besides Green with an A-: Rep. Cheri Bustos of Illinois, Sen. Jon Tester of Montana, Rep. Kurt Schrader of Oregon and Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas. Sen. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota was rated AQ. We reached out to Sean Theriault, a professor at the University of Texas who studies Congress. He said: ""It looks like Green is among a group of Democrats who support the Second Amendment."" Heading into the 2014 House elections, according to a ProPublica graphic Theriault sent us, 25 Democrats in Congress were rated from A- to A+. So, why did we identify only a dozen with that distinction? Many of the Democrats who drew high NRA marks in 2013 didn’t win re-election the next year.   Our ruling Adrian Garcia said that his competitor in the Democratic race for Texas’ 29th district, Rep. Gene Green, has a ""lifetime A rating"" from the NRA and is the NRA’s ""favorite Democrat in Congress."" Green has certainly been a strong supporter of gun rights over his 23 years in the House. The gun control measures Green’s campaign pointed out that he supported were part of packages like the 1994 crime bill, in which Green voted with his party. However, the votes Garcia cites seem to have been cherry-picked from Green’s long career in Congress. While Green has voted against child safety locks, as Garcia said, he also later voted for them. In recent years, Green has inched away from NRA interests, supporting bipartisan gun legislation and President Obama’s executive action on gun safety. Garcia’s claim on Green’s ""lifetime rating"" also misses Green’s 1994 sharp drop in favor with the NRA and his recent slight shift away from the organization. As for the NRA’s ""favorite Democrat,"" Green is not the only Democrat to support gun rights, or to be supported by the NRA. He’s not even the organization’s strongest Democratic supporter, based on its most recent ratings. He is part of a shrinking group of pro-gun Democrats",Mostly False,"February 5, 2016"
"""Since John F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, more Americans have died by gunfire within our own country than American servicemen and women who were killed in all our wars.""","During a recent rally at Capitol Square in Richmond, gun control advocates handed out fliers with a grisly statistic. ""Since John F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, more Americans have died by gunfire within our own country than American servicemen and women who were killed in all our wars,"" says the brochure, distributed on Jan. 18 by the Virginia Center for Public Safety. The claim is familiar to PolitiFact; it’s been vetted by our colleagues in the national office twice over the years. We decided to take a new look through the lens of the latest available data. War casualties The most comprehensive list we found on U.S. war dead was compiled in January 2015 by the Congressional Research Service. It included casualties from the Revolutionary War through Operation Inherent Resolve, which is targeting the Islamic State militant group in Iraq and Syria. The number of U.S. dead in all those conflicts comes to nearly 1.2 million, according to the research service. We should add a qualifier here: The research service says that during the Civil War, the nation’s deadliest conflict, Union and Confederate losses combined were 525,000 to 530,000. But a 2012 study by a Binghamton University historian estimated the combined toll was much higher -- about 750,000. If we use that higher Civil War figure, it would bring the total U.S. deaths in military conflicts to about 1.4 million. Gun deaths The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides a series of hard figures and estimates of yearly gunfire deaths in the U.S. from 1968 to 2014. They add up to about 1.5 million fatalities. The Virginia Center for Public Safety’s claim on gun deaths goes back a little bit further, to 1963.  We couldn’t find figures going back to that year, since the oldest year for which data were available was 1968. A CDC chart shows 24,000 gun deaths occurred that year. With that in mind, the figure of 1.5 million deaths since November 1963 surely is an underestimate of the level of gun violence since then, because it excludes four years. The actual number probably is close to 1.6 million. A key thing to know about these figures: They include not just murders but all gun deaths. In 2013, according to CDC data, 63 percent of gun deaths were suicides; 33 percent were homicides; and the rest were from accidents, legal interventions and undetermined causes. Our ruling The Virginia Center for Public Safety says that since 1963, more Americans have been killed by gunfire than have been killed in all U.S. wars. Figures going back to 1968 show about 1.5 million firearms deaths have occurred since then. That doesn’t include data from gun deaths from 1963 to 1967, years for which figures aren’t available, so this is a conservative estimate on firearms deaths since Kennedy was assassinated. In contrast, a high-side figure for U.S. war deaths shows that about 1.4 million service members have been killed in conflicts",True,"January 26, 2016"
"""I have a D-minus voting record from the NRA.""","Sen. Bernie Sanders is wearing a bad grade as a badge of honor. The Democratic presidential candidate is under fire since Sunday’s debate for his votes on gun legislation, with chief rival Hillary Clinton eagerly highlighting his flip-flops on immunity for gun dealers, among other issues. Sanders got his chance to explain himself in Underwood, Iowa, when an audience member asked him about his past positions, which she said seemed more Republican. Sanders said that impression wasn’t right.   ""I have a D-minus voting record from the NRA,"" he said. ""Does that sound like a tool of the NRA? D-minus."" We wanted to know if his statement earned perfect marks. A spokesman for Sanders’ campaign said Sanders’ NRA grade came during the 2012 election cycle, as shown in the lobby group’s subscriber-only database. The group awarded Republican John MacGovern, Sanders’ unsuccessful challenger, an A.  The NRA corroborated Sanders’ D-minus grade. Of course, 2012 wasn’t Sanders’ first public-office rodeo. The NRA (or technically its political action committee, the NRA-Political Victory Fund) has grades for Sanders as far back as 1992, when he ran for his second term for Congress as an independent from Vermont. (The NRA did not have earlier ratings available even though Sanders first ran for Congress in 1988 before winning in 1990.) The grades the gun lobby did have on file show Sanders has never exactly been in its favor, with one sort-of exception. 1992 D 1994 F 1996 F 1998 F 2000 F 2002 F 2004 D+ 2006 C- 2012 D-   Our first thought: Man, the NRA really didn’t like Sanders in the 1990s and early 2000s, awarding five straight Fs. The NRA slightly warmed to Sanders in the mid 2000s, giving him a D-plus in 2004 and a C-minus in 2006, his first bid for the Senate. That’s mediocre but passing, right? The change of heart corresponds with Sanders voting in favor of the gun liability bill, which passed in October 2005 with NRA support. The bill also contained provisions for childproof trigger locks and a ban on body armor-piercing bullets, which Sanders mentioned as he explained his vote to the audience in Underwood. However, its most controversial provision was broad immunity for gun sellers, with a few exceptions, such as if the seller was negligent or knowingly broke the law in making the sale. The Democrats opposed this section, but the bill passed 283-144 in the House. (You can read more about Sanders' votes on guns over his congressional career in this fact-check.) NRA spokeswoman Amy Hunter gave us a little more insight into the group’s grading process. Ratings are compiled by lobbyists and analysts who know the issues in their specific region well, she said, and are generally not done for primaries. Each grade represents each election cycle, including all of the relevant gun issues in that politician’s state and the country at that time. ""They only last through that election,"" Hunter said. Clinton’s most recent grade came in 2006 as she ran for re-election to the Senate in 2006. It was an F. Our ruling Sanders said he has a ""D-minus grade"" from the NRA. He’s accurately referring to the most recent assessment from the gun lobby group in 2012. The NRA has not issued a more recent evaluation for Sanders for the 2016 primary election. It’s worth noting that the grade is a few years old, and that his rating has been higher in previous election cycles. Still, a D-minus is far from a full-throated endorsement",Mostly True,"January 20, 2016"
"Says Bernie Sanders ""voted for what we call the 'Charleston Loophole.'""","Trying to highlight an area where she is to the left of her opponent, Hillary Clinton attacked Bernie Sanders for his position on guns during the NBC-YouTube Democratic debate in Charleston, S.C. Guns are a particularly emotional topic in South Carolina after Dylann Roof was accused of killing nine African-Americans in a Charleston church in June. Sanders, a senator from Vermont, defended his record on guns saying that he ""supported from day one an instant background check to make certain that people who should not have guns do not have guns."" Clinton fired back at Sanders with a list of his votes on gun bills, including this one: ""He voted for what we call the ‘Charleston loophole.’ "" We wanted to know what Clinton meant by the ""Charleston loophole"" and if Sanders voted for it. Brady bill Clinton and some advocates for tighter gun laws argued Roof was abetted by the three-day time limit for background checks for gun purchases, dubbing it the ""Charleston loophole."" Supporters of gun rights say blame actually goes to the FBI and its botched paperwork. Under current federal law, the FBI performs background checks on would-be gun buyers in South Carolina and 29 other states through its National Instant Criminal Background Check System. (The rest of the states do their own background checks.) If the check isn’t denied or completed in three days, the gun seller can proceed with the sale. Roof was able to get a gun as a result of clerical errors. Roof tried to buy a handgun in West Columbia, S.C., on April 11. An FBI examiner found that Roof had been arrested for a drug charge March 1. Because the records didn’t show a conviction, the examiner couldn’t deny the purchase but continued to look into Roof’s criminal history. Roof’s rap sheet mistakenly listed the neighboring county’s sheriff office as the agency that arrested him, leading the FBI examiner to request more information from the wrong offices. When the three days were up, the case was still listed as ""pending"" and Roof was able to purchase the gun. Two months later, Roof allegedly shot and killed nine worshippers and injured one in a historically black church in Charleston. He faces trial on murder charges later this year. Those three days were at the heart of the the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, which passed in 1993. A word about waiting periods: The Brady Bill didn’t contain a waiting period that required purchasers to wait to receive their firearm. (Some advocates like this idea, because they believe it might prevent impulsive acts of gun violence.) Rather, the bill set a time limit -- sometimes called a default to proceed -- for the government to conduct its background checks. Sanders, then in the U.S. House of Representatives, voted against the Brady Bill five times -- including a version that reinstated a five-day time limit for background checks. In November 1993, Sanders voted for an amendment imposing an instant background check instead. The problem was technology for instant checks didn’t exist at the time. As a result, according to the Washington Post Fact-Checker, supporters of the Brady bill were forced to negotiate a compromise. What first was proposed as 10 days for the government to conduct the check ultimately was whittled to three days. The final compromise version of the Brady bill was passed and signed into law on Nov. 30, 1993. It prohibited the transfer of a gun to an unlicensed individual, unless three business days have lapsed and the system has not notified the transferor that it would violate the law. Sanders voted against the final bill. Sanders’ campaign manager Jeff Weaver told us in July that Sanders voted against the bill because he believed a national waiting period was a federal overreach and because he was answering to his constituents. (We did not get a response from the Sanders’ campaign on debate night about Clinton’s attack.) So to recap: Sanders supported shortening the time the government had to conduct background checks. Whether extra time would have kept Roof from purchasing a gun is unclear. Clinton said that Sanders ""voted for what we call the Charleston loophole."" In 2015, Roof was able to buy a gun after time ran out for the government to perform a background check  -- the result of a clerical error when the FBI sought records from the wrong local law enforcement agency about Roof. Whether more time would have made a difference remains unknown. But Roof was able to purchase the gun after a three-day waiting period expired. Sanders voted in 1993 to shorten the time window for the government to conduct its check. Roof was able to purchase a gun after waiting out a three-day time limit on background checks",Mostly True,"January 17, 2016"
"Says Bernie Sanders ""has reversed his position on immunity"" for gun manufacturers and sellers.","In the increasingly competitive Democratic primary for president, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has spent months hammering Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders for his vote on a 2005 bill that provided gun makers, sellers and trade associations with significant protection against lawsuits. Now, after Sanders clarified his position on the issue, she’s calling him a flip-flopper. Sanders, who represents the small, rural state of Vermont where guns are widely accepted, has sometimes sided with advocates of gun rights on key legislation and sometimes sided with supporters of gun control. One of the primary examples where Sanders broke with Democrats is in supporting the gun liability bill, which was enacted in 2005. A similar bill also passed the U.S. House in 2003. Sanders, then serving in the House, voted for it both times. Clinton called on Sanders to ""stand up and say I got this one wrong"" in a Jan. 8 interview on MSNBC’s Hardball.   About a week later, Sanders released a statement on the gun-liability issue in the run-up to the Jan. 17 Democratic debate in Charleston, S.C. In a news release, Sanders said, ""I’m pleased that this legislation is being introduced,"" referring to proposals by Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., and Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., to rescind portions of the 2005 law. ""As I have said for many months now, we need to look at the underlying law and tighten it up,"" Sanders added. The Clinton camp portrayed this as a flip-flop during the Charleston debate. Clinton said, ""I am pleased to hear that Sen. Sanders has reversed his position on immunity, and I look forward to him joining with those members of Congress who have already introduced legislation."" The Sanders camp disagreed that this was a change of position. Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver had told MSNBC, ""This is not a flip flop, this is consistent with the position he held earlier in the campaign."" So is Clinton’s portrayal accurate? We took a closer look. Sanders’ vote on the 2005 bill While the bill includes two relatively non-controversial provisions -- one on trigger locks and the other on armor-piercing bullets -- the most contentious elements of the 2005 bill, and the ones that drove overwhelming Democratic opposition at the time, deal with liability for gun makers and sellers. The official bill summary provides for broad-based immunity for gun sellers, but it also provides a few exceptions, such as: • Cases where a person transfers a firearm knowing that a violent crime or drug-trafficking crime will be committed with it; • Cases where a seller is negligent or a manufacturer or seller knowingly violated the law; • And cases involving an injury caused by a physical defect with the weapon when it was used as intended. What Sanders and his campaign said prior to Jan. 16 On numerous occasions, Sanders or his aides have expressed comfort with his past vote. In June 2015, Weaver, Sanders’ campaign manager, told Politico, ""I believe he would make the same vote"" today. In October, at a Democratic debate in Las Vegas, Sanders said, ""If somebody has a gun and it falls into the hands of a murderer and that murderer kills somebody with the gun, do you hold the gun manufacturer responsible? Not any more than you would hold a hammer company responsible if somebody beats somebody over the head with a hammer. That is not what a lawsuit should be about."" Sanders continued to make similar arguments into January 2016. Asked by CBS whether gun manufacturers should be held accountable for gun deaths, Sanders said, ""Of course not, that doesn't make any sense,"" he said, while adding that if guns fall into the hands of criminals, ""Of course you hold the gun manufacturers liable."" At the same time, Sanders has increasingly fine-tuned his stance, saying he’d be open to reconsidering his vote on the 2005 measure. In an October 2015 interview on NBC’s Meet the Press, Sanders said he was ""willing to see changes"" in the gun-liability provision: ""Can we take another look at that liability issue? Yes."" Then, in January, a few days before the campaign issued its news release on gun liability, Sanders told a crowd in Iowa, ""I think we should take another look at that legislation and get rid of those provisions which allow gun manufacturers to act irresponsibly."" The Jan. 16 news release In the news release, Sanders expressed support for the Blumenthal-Schiff initiative to rescind the liability portions of the 2005 law. The trigger-lock and armor-piercing-ammunition provisions would not be overturned. The sponsors said they will try to advance the Equal Access to Justice for Victims of Gun Violence Act as an amendment to an appropriations bill, according to the New York Times. On the Jan. 17 edition of NBC’s Meet the Press, Sanders explained that in 2005, ""there were things in (the bill) that I did not like and I was willing to rethink. We have rethought it. There's a bill apparently being introduced, I like that bill, it makes some good changes and we will be supportive of it."" Sanders did say in his news release that he will be proposing an amendment to the Blumenthal and Schiff bills to require the Commerce Department to monitor and report on the law’s impact in rural areas on the availability of hunting supplies, including firearms, sold by non-negligent local gun stores. This, he indicated, was consistent with his past concerns about the threat of lawsuits against small gun shops serving primarily rural areas of Vermont. Our ruling So is Clinton right that Sanders flip-flopped on immunity for gun manufacturers and sellers? Sanders voted for the 2005 measure that provided broad liability exclusions for gunmakers and sellers. After months of Sanders and his staff defending the vote, Sanders’ position started to evolve in October. Sanders’ position three months ago -- that he would ""take another look"" at the liability question -- is consistent with his Jan. 16 news release saying he supported a proposal to rescind the immunity provisions. But to look back only to October doesn’t tell the full story, ignoring not only the 2003 and 2005 votes but also several instances in which Sanders or his staff defended those votes in interviews between June 2015 and early January 2016",True,"January 17, 2016"
"""California Senator, Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said if she could say to Mr. America and Mrs. America, 'Give me your guns, I'm rounding 'em up,' she would.""","LISTEN TO THIS STORY:  Texas Senator Ted Cruz repeated a false claim about California Senator Dianne Feinstein and guns during Thursday night’s GOP presidential candidates debate in South Carolina. Cruz said at the debate: ""California Senator, Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said if she could say to Mr. America and Mrs. America, 'Give me your guns, I'm rounding 'em up,' she would.""  Cruz's claim is at the 9:30 minute mark in the video above. The Texas Republican made a nearly identical claim Jan. 7 in a CNN interview. We ruled it false. In that interview, Cruz told CNN: ""I’ll tell you who I do take at her word is Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who said: ‘If I could go to Mr. America, Mrs. America, and say, hand over your guns, I want all of your guns, I would do it.’"" We focused on Cruz's provocative comments that Feinstein said she wanted Americans to ""hand over your guns, I want all your guns."" We learned Cruz took a statement Feinstein made in 1995 about the assault weapons ban she authored far, far out of context. No love lost Cruz and Feinstein are about as far apart on gun rights as any politicians in Washington D.C. The senators famously sparred in 2013, during Feinstein’s unsuccessful attempt to pass a revamped assault weapons ban. At a Senate hearing, the longtime California senator accused Cruz of giving her a ""lecture"" on constitutional rights. ""I’m not a sixth grader,"" Feinstein told Cruz, during a terse exchange. ""I come from a different place than you. I respect your views. I ask you to respect my views."" Cruz had suggested Feinstein was trying to pick apart the Second Amendment, in a way she would never try with the First or Fourth Amendments. Cruz is among the biggest gun rights backers in the GOP presidential candidate field. As Texas solicitor general, he led a successful fight before the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn a Washington D.C. gun ban in 2008. His defense of the Second Amendment has continued this winter in stump speeches from New Hampshire to Nevada.  Republican presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) meets with attendees Tuesday, Jan. 12, 2016, during a campaign stop at Granite State Indoor Range in Hudson, N.H. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke) Feinstein on guns Feinstein, by contrast, is considered a leader on gun control. In 1994, she authored the Federal Assault Weapons Ban, which was signed by President Bill Clinton. It prohibited the manufacture of 19 specific kinds of military-style, semi-automatic firearms, often called assault weapons. It also banned the manufacture and sale of gun magazines that hold more than 10 bullets. The bill expired in 2004 after efforts to extend it failed in Congress. Its restrictions did not apply to any semi-automatic weapons or magazines made before the ban’s effective date: Sept. 13, 1994. Video of Feinstein’s comment In an interview with 60 Minutes that aired in February 1995, correspondent Lesley Stahl asked Feinstein about this loophole, which made it legal to buy and sell hundreds of thousands of the assault weapons the senator had sought to restrict. Feinstein responded: ""If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban, picking up every one of them, ‘Mr. and Mrs. America turn ‘em all in,’ I would have done it. I could not do that. The votes weren’t here.’"" Cruz’s campaign spokesman pointed to this statement when we asked him to back up the presidential hopeful’s claim. It’s available on YouTube as a short excerpt of the longer 60 Minutes piece.   The YouTube video makes it clear that the interview is about the assault weapons ban. The term ""assault weapon"" is uttered in the first sentence, just as the video clip shows Feinstein hoisting up a semiautomatic weapon at a press conference. Nowhere in the short piece or the full interview does Feinstein discuss banning ""all guns"" as Cruz claimed. Feinstein does say in the TV interview that she wanted to ban all assault weapons, regardless of when they were made. She again made that point in a speech on the U.S. Senate floor several months after the 60 Minutes interview, in December 1995: ""If I had my way, I would ban the possession of assault weapons anywhere in the United States of America, but there were not going to be the votes for that,"" she said, according to a transcript in the Congressional Record. Feinstein has outlined her support for legal gun ownership in many ways, including during the effort to renew the assault weapons ban. ""Let me be clear: If an individual wants to purchase a weapon for hunting or self-defense, I support that right,"" Feinstein wrote in an op-ed in the San Francisco Chronicle in July 2012. Our ruling Cruz has claimed multiple times that Feinstein stated her desire to tell Americans ""I want all of your guns,"" or ""I'm rounding 'em up."" When asked to show evidence of the claim, Cruz’s spokesman pointed to a short segment of a 60 Minutes piece that centered on Feinstein’s assault weapons ban from two decades ago. While Feinstein calls for an ""outright ban"" in the excerpt, a reasonable look at that sound bite, and a transcript of the full 60 Minutes interview, shows Feinstein is not referring to banning ""all guns."" Instead, she’s relaying that she failed to achieve her desired full ban on assault weapons. The full TV segment details a large loophole in the law that allows the sale and purchase of assault weapons made before the ban went into effect. Feinstein’s statement is clearly in response to concerns over that loophole",False,"January 15, 2016"
"Says President Barack Obama ""appointed Eric Holder as attorney general. Eric Holder said he viewed his mission as brainwashing the American people against guns.""","During the Republican presidential debate in North Charleston, S.C., Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, re-litigated the background of President Barack Obama’s former attorney general, Eric Holder. One of the debate moderators, Maria Bartiromo of Fox Business Network, asked Cruz for ""the answer"" to stopping mass shootings and violent crime. ""The answer is simple,"" he said. ""You prosecute criminals. You target the bad guys. You know, a minute ago, (co-debate moderator Neil Cavuto) asked, ‘What has President Obama done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns? Well, he appointed Eric Holder as attorney general. Eric Holder said he viewed his mission as brainwashing the American people against guns. He appointed Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court, someone who has been a radical against the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms."" We raised our eyebrows at Cruz’s mention of Holder and what he said. Is Cruz right? Let’s go to the videotape from back in 1995, a time when there really were such things as videotapes. In January 1995, Holder -- then the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia -- gave a speech announcing a plan to curb gun violence in the city of Washington, D.C. Here’s a portion of the speech, recorded by C-SPAN. ""What we need to do is change the way in which people think about guns, especially young people, and make it something that’s not cool, that it’s not acceptable, it’s not hip to carry a gun anymore, in the way in which we changed our attitudes about cigarettes,"" Holder said. He later added, ""We have to be repetitive about this. It’s not enough to have a catchy ad on a Monday and then only do it Monday. We need to do this every day of the week, and just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way."" So there’s video proof that Holder did indeed say what Cruz said he did. That said, we’ll offer two caveats. First, the way Cruz phrased his statement might lead listeners to believe that Holder had talked about ""brainwashing"" during his tenure as attorney general or shortly before he was nominated by Obama for the post. That’s not the case -- the remark in question came a full 14 years earlier. Second, Cruz leaves out the context in which Holder was speaking. As the top federal law enforcement official for the District of Columbia, Holder was speaking at a very particular time about a very particular place. At the time, drug-related crime and gun murders in Washington were a serious concern, both locally and nationally. A few years before, D.C. had been dubbed the ""murder capital of the world."" In other portions of the speech, Holder can be heard referring specifically to youth violence in the nation’s capital and referencing local officials such as once-and-future mayor Marion Barry. This D.C. focus by Holder is supported by a Jan. 13, 1995, Washington Post article that preceded the speech but which laid out a general overview of Holder’s initiative. ""U.S. Attorney Eric H. Holder Jr. said yesterday he is completing the details of a massive law enforcement effort to get guns off Washington's streets,"" the article says. ""It will target people carrying and selling firearms in the city's most violent neighborhoods."" In addition to tougher law enforcement, Holder was proposing efforts to change "" ‘romanticized’ perceptions about guns and violence, especially among young black men."" Holder -- the first African American to serve as U.S. attorney in Washington -- was planning to unveil the speech on Martin Luther King Jr.’s birthday. ""As a people, did we fight, did we sacrifice, did we die simply to inherit and then bequeath to our children this kind of America where crimes run rampant and fears stalk our citizens?"" Holder wrote in a draft of the speech, according to the Post. Holder told the Post that the goal of the effort was designed to reduce violence in Washington by the end of the decade to levels prior to 1986, when crack cocaine sent homicides and shootings soaring. ""I believe that if you can really change the way young people, especially young black men, view the possession and use of guns ... you can have a significant impact on the quality of life in this city,"" Holder told the Post. This is a nuance that Cruz’s statement ignores. Our ruling Cruz said Obama ""appointed Eric Holder as attorney general. Eric Holder said he viewed his mission as brainwashing the American people against guns."" Holder unquestionably said the word ""brainwash."" But Cruz leaves out some important context -- how long ago the comment was made, and the fact that it was targeted toward youth during a high-crime era in Washington, D.C., not the overall American public",Half True,"January 15, 2016"
"Every ""one of the mass shootings except two in America since 1950 have been"" in ""gun-free zones.""","Dan Patrick of Texas hinted he’d like to ease access to guns, then lofted a historical claim making us wonder. The Republican lieutenant governor appeared on NBC’s Jan. 3, 2016 edition of Meet the Press as the Texas law permitting licensed individuals to openly carry holstered handguns took effect. Patrick told host Chuck Todd he wants to see a day ""when every American citizen can simply have a gun, does not have to go through a long ordeal or pay a high price. We're going to address that in Texas, as well. Because it's the right of every individual under the Second Amendment."" Then came the historical note: ""Having law-abiding citizens having guns is a good thing,"" Patrick said. ""In fact, Chuck, every one of the mass shootings except two in America since 1950 have been"" in ""gun-free zones,"" his implication being that wrongdoers don’t open fire in places where permitted citizens may have loaded handguns. That’s at least a disputed analysis. In April 2013, Mother Jones magazine said its review of more than five dozen U.S. ""mass shootings"" since 1982 hadn’t identified a single case of a killer choosing a target because it barred guns nor had it found an instance of an armed civilian saving the day. ""To the contrary, in many of the cases there was clearly another motive for the choice of location. For example, 20 were workplace shootings,"" the magazine said. ""Or consider the 12 school shootings we documented, in which all but one of the killers had personal ties to the school they struck,"" the story said. Moreover, the magazine said, the majority of mass shootings are murder-suicides, arguably not involving perpetrators ""whose priority was identifying the safest place to attack."" So, how did Patrick determine that only two mass shootings since 1950 occurred in places that weren’t gun-free zones? A spokesman, Alejandro Garcia, declined comment on that, but web searches and interviews identified the likely originator of the two-since-1950 claim as economist John Lott Jr., whose books include ""More Guns, Less Crime"" and ""The Bias Against Guns."" Lott, president of the Crime Prevention Research Center, also is a Fox News columnist. In a January 2013 blog post, Lott said: ""Since at least 1950, with two exceptions, all the multiple victim public shootings in the US in which more than three people have been killed have taken place where guns are banned."" In a 2014 web post, the center said: ""There are only two mass public shootings since at least 1950 that have not been part of some other crime where at least four people have been killed in an area where civilians are generally allowed to have guns.  These are the International House of Pancakes restaurant in Carson City, Nevada, on September 6, 2011 and the Gabrielle Giffords shooting in Tucson, Arizona, on January 8, 2011."" Defining ""mass shooting"" Generally we take a gun-free zone to mean a place where civilians can’t legally carry handguns. That’s in the spirit of the Gun-Free School Zones Act, revised by Congress in 1996, which states it’s unlawful for an individual to knowingly carry a firearm that’s been part of interstate or foreign commerce in a school zone or within 1,000 feet of the grounds of a public, parochial or private school. But ""mass shooting"" has had a range of definitions. In a 1996 paper, Lott and a fellow researcher presented a multi-part definition ruling out incidents connected to other crimes and applying other limits. The paper defined ""a multiple public shooting as one in which two or more people are killed or wounded in a church, business, bar, street, government buildings, schools, public transit, place of employment, park, health care facility, mall or restaurant. We excluded multiple shootings that were byproducts of other crimes (e.g., a robbery or drug deal) or that involved gang activity (e.g., drive-by shootings), professional hits or organized crime. We also did not count as a multiple shooting serial killings or killings that took place over the span of more than one day,"" the authors wrote. There are less restrictive definitions. A 2008 FBI report said that over the previous 30 years, a mass murder was described as four or more murders occurring during the same incident, with no distinctive time period between the murders. A 2013 report by the Congressional Research Service said there’s no agreed-upon definition of ""mass shooting,"" so it would define public mass shootings as ""incidents occurring in relatively public places, involving four or more deaths—not including the shooter(s)—and gunmen who select victims somewhat indiscriminately."" Meantime,  an FBI spokesman, Stephen Fischer, advised us by email that a 2012 law set the threshold for a ""mass killing""  as three or more people killed. Mother Jones magazine, in research last updated in December 2015, employed a four-or-more killed definition to conclude that since 1982, there had been at least 73 U.S. mass shootings--meaning public incidents in which four or more people died and the motive appeared to be indiscriminate killing. Still, in an August 2012 story, Mother Jones suggested that classifying a mass murder based on a death count or lack of ties to other crimes could seem arbitrary. ""Dropping the number of fatalities by just one, or including motives of armed robbery, gang violence, or domestic violence, would add many, many more cases,"" the magazine said. Lott summarizes research We reached out to Lott, who estimated by phone there had been about 200 mass shootings since 1950. By email, he sent spreadsheets that he said show how he and other researchers catalogued incidents from 1977 to the present. A result, Lott said, is the conclusion that just the two mass shootings occurred where civilians could legally carry handguns. No signs barred people from bringing handguns into the Nevada restaurant or the Tucson parking lot, Lott said, and both states permitted licensed citizens to carry handguns. We asked Lott about the Aug. 1, 1966, incident when Charles Whitman shot and killed people from atop the University of Texas tower as residents with rifles fired from below; Whitman died after a police officer subdued him from close range. Civilians wielded weapons that day, no? Lott said he classified UT as a gun-free zone because under Texas law until 1996, residents couldn’t legally carry handguns in public except under limited circumstances. Lott, asked how he delved into incidents from 1950 to 1977, pointed out an April 2000 New York Times news story on 100 U.S. ""rampage killings"" from 1949 to 1999. The 100 cases included 20 shootings at schools, 11 at restaurants or shopping malls and 32 at the killer's workplace, the newspaper reported. There were 102 killers, it said, with 425 people killed and 510 injured. We couldn’t tell if the Times determined whether citizens could carry handguns at the shooting sites. Lott told us his research determined, in each Times-listed instance, if laws allowed civilians in a city or state to get gun permits and to carry handguns. He emailed us a map indicating that as of 1986, 29 states allowed civilians to carry handguns and 21 states (including Texas) did not; by 2003, 44 states allowed civilians to carry handguns. An alternate analysis We spotted a short-term breakdown countering Lott’s all-but-two conclusion, though the center headed by Lott maintains it’s wrong. In a 2014 report, Everytown for Gun Safety, a pro-gun control group, said that from 2009 to July 2014, 18 multiple-victim U.S. shootings--meaning any incident where at least four people were killed with a gun--occurred in places where civilian handguns were allowed. Of 33 incidents in public spaces, the report said, 18 took place wholly or in part where concealed guns could be lawfully carried. Conversely, no more than 15 incidents ""took place entirely in public spaces that were so-called ‘gun-free zones,’"" the report said. Jack Warner, an Everytown spokesman, told us by email that a 2010 shooting incident in a Hialeah, Florida, restaurant later was removed from its count; the establishment was a gun-free zone. Seventeen is far more than two, of course, and the Everytown report covered less than six years, far fewer than the 65 years referenced by Lott. Might it be that far more shootings have taken place in locations where a licensed citizen could legally hoist a handgun? Questioning the report, the Lott-led center charged in a September 2014 web post that nearly half the incidents described as occurring where civilians could carry handguns took place either as parts of other crimes or in non-public locations and so shouldn’t have been deemed mass shootings--or the shootings actually took place in gun-free zones such as a Wisconsin temple where guns weren’t allowed, according to a Fox News report authored by John Lott’s son, Maxim, though Mother Jones in 2013 reported that guns were allowed in the temple. The center’s critique gives a taste of Lott’s investigatory approach. According to the post, Lott followed up the March 2009 shooting deaths of eight people in a North Carolina nursing home by calling the home and hearing that neither the home’s residents or staff had been allowed to bring in guns. In another case, after the 2012 shooting deaths of four people at a Georgia spa, Lott ""spoke with someone at the spa after the attack and was told that the killer knew ‘nobody there had a gun.’  ...While the official policy at the spa isn’t clear because the conversation was very short,"" the center wrote, ""the important thing was that the killer knew that there were no guns for people to defend themselves there."" There’s room for quibbling with the center’s critique perhaps in that one of the center’s declared gun-free zones was the Washington Navy Yard, which is fronted by armed guards. We noticed this note in a Lott spreadsheet summarizing that attack: ""There were armed guards at the Washington Navy Yard, and the shooter was familiar with the premises, so he did not select it as a target on the presumption he would not face armed resistance. In fact, the shooter reportedly used a gun that he took from a guard after killing him."" Regardless, Lott told us by email, the shooter knew that past the guard station, he wouldn’t encounter armed individuals. Lott’s note in his spreadsheet summarizing an August 2010 incident in Buffalo lays out his contention that even if civilians legally may have handguns, that’s often unlikely to occur; the note quotes a police inspector saying local authorities virtually never give out gun permits other than for sportsmen to carry weapons for hunting. In the same vein, the center’s 2014 critique said several shootings tallied by the Everytown group occurred in places -- such as Boston, East Oakland and Los Angeles -- where authorities rarely if ever grant handgun permits. By email, Warner gave no ground, saying state and local laws made it legally possible in each of the cited shootings for a civilian to have been present with a handgun. Also, ""narrowing the definition of ‘gun-free zone’ to exclude locations where armed police were stationed does not make sense,"" Warner wrote. An FBI study A 2013 FBI review of ""active shooter incidents"" since 2000 identified five instances when shooting ended after armed individuals who were not law enforcement exchanged gunfire with the shooters; three shooters were killed, one was wounded, one committed suicide. ""The individuals involved in these shootings included a citizen with a valid firearms permit and armed security guards at a church, an airline counter, a federally managed museum, and a school board meeting,"" the report said. The report gave more detail about a civilian’s intervention in a Nevada incident. In May 2008, the report said, Ernesto Villagomez, 30, armed with a handgun, began firing inside Player’s Bar and Grill in Winnemucca, Nevada. Two people were killed; two were wounded (leaving the results short of the three or four deaths needed to be a mass shooting by most definitions). ""The shooter was killed by a citizen with a valid firearm permit before police arrived,"" the report said. Our ruling Patrick said every ""one of the mass shootings except two in America since 1950 have been"" in ""gun-free zones."" The Lott-steered research delivers a basis for this statement. But this all-but-two assessment also rests on how you define a mass shooting or gun-free zone. Change the definitions to take in more events and you end up with more shootings in places that weren’t otherwise free of guns",Half True,"January 13, 2016"
"""A violent felon can buy (a gun) over the Internet with no background check, no questions asked.""","Under the current system, dangerous people are able to buy firearms far too often, President Barack Obama said in a speech announcing new executive action on gun policy. ""The problem is some gun sellers have been operating under a different set of rules,"" he said Jan. 5. ""A violent felon can buy the exact same weapon over the Internet with no background check, no questions asked."" Quite a few readers flagged Obama’s claim that a violent felon can buy a gun online without a background check, so we decided to fact-check it. Some readers seemed to think Obama was suggesting such transactions were legal. We don’t see that in Obama’s comments. (The grammarians at PolitiFact would note that Obama said ""can,"" not ""may."") To be clear, such a transaction would be illegal. What Obama said is that such transactions are possible. That is accurate, but it’s also a little more complicated than Obama’s comment suggests. A big loophole Federal law prohibits felons from purchasing or receiving guns unless their rights have been formally restored. However, felons can get around this obstacle by buying guns from sellers who do not require criminal background checks. ""Violent felons aren't allowed to buy guns, period,"" said Adam Winkler, a law professor at the University of California Los Angeles. ""But they can take advantage of the loophole in federal law that allows gun sales, including some gun sales over the Internet, to purchase from non-licensed sellers, who don't have to conduct a background check."" Anyone who repeatedly buys and sells firearms ""with the principal motive of making a profit"" has to get a dealer’s license, whether they deal out of a brick-and-mortar store, at a flea market, or online, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Licensed firearm dealers must run background checks on non-licensed buyers before selling them a gun. But the law does not require a dealer’s license for private hobbyists and others who occasionally buy and sell guns for the purpose of enhancing or liquidating a collection. If an individual buys a gun from someone who does not have or require a license, the purchaser does not have to undergo a background check. So a violent felon could buy a gun from a hobbyist over the Internet because he or she would not be subject to a background check. The purchase would still be illegal, because of the buyer’s felon status, but it would not create an immediate red flag. The same thing can happen at a gun show. There are a couple of important limitations on these sorts of online private transactions. First, private sales, online or otherwise, cannot take place across state lines, so the buyer and seller must be in the same state. And there are many restrictions on shipping guns, so the actual transfer of the gun is likely to take place in person. Second, it is illegal for private sellers to transfer a gun to someone they either know or reasonably believe is prohibited from owning a gun, for example, if the seller knows the buyer is a felon. But online sellers ""can give themselves plausible deniability by not asking the necessary questions,"" said Garen Wintemute, a professor of emergency medicine at the University of California Davis. Additionally, several states — California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington — and the District of Columbia require background checks for all private gun sales.  There is a sizeable online market for private, background check-free gun sales, according to a 2013 study by Third Way, a center-left think tank. Focusing on the website Armslist.com, a sort of Craigslist for firearms and accessories, in 10 states, Third Way found 2,000 ads from individuals looking to purchase guns from private sellers specifically. In its own 2013 review of Armslist and similar sites, the New York Times found that these sites ""function as unregulated bazaars, where the essential anonymity of the Internet allows unlicensed sellers to advertise scores of weapons and people legally barred from gun ownership to buy them."" Their investigation identified several individuals with criminal backgrounds buying and selling firearms over the Internet. Still, only a small slice of gun purchases take place online. In a December Quinnipiac poll, just 3 percent of gun owners said they obtained a gun from an online seller. Obama’s statement ""rings true,"" said John Donohue, a law professor at Stanford University. ""Since our goal is to keep guns from the hands of criminals, it doesn't make sense that if you go to a store to buy a gun you have to go through a background check,"" Donohue said, ""But if you buy the exact same gun on the Internet from a private seller, you don't have to go through a background check."" Winkler said Obama’s proposed executive action won’t do much to curb these kinds of transactions, though, ""because the loophole is baked into federal law."" Regarding background checks, Obama has directed the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms to ""clarify"" that anyone ""engaged in the business of dealing in firearms"" needs a license — meaning self-described hobbyists who regularly sell guns, rather than just occasionally, might be violating the law by operating without a license. But this doesn’t directly stop felons from buying guns from private sellers who don’t have a license and don’t require purchasers to undergo background checks. Our ruling Obama said, ""A violent felon can buy (a gun) over the Internet with no background check, no questions asked."" The kind of transaction Obama described is possible, though illegal, and more complicated than his comment suggests. Federal law prohibits felons from buying guns. But with some effort, they can purchase guns from private sellers over the Internet without getting caught, because private sellers are not required to run background checks. That seller would have to be in the same state as the buyer",Mostly True,"January 5, 2016"
"""The 90 percent statistic of supporting background checks, that's been debunked.""","Gun control advocates often cite the statistic that 90 percent of Americans support expanding background checks for gun purchases. President Barack Obama just did it in his Jan. 1, 2016, weekly address. But conservative radio talk show host Laura Ingraham says that statistic is not accurate. ""The 90 percent statistic of supporting background checks, that's been debunked,"" Ingraham said on Fox News Sunday on Jan. 3. ""Lots of the myths about gun ownership are perpetrated by people who never much liked the Second Amendment in the first place and who have a vested interest in amassing more power in Washington, D.C."" PolitiFact has rated this 90 percent statistic True as recently as October. So we decided to try and figure out what Ingraham was talking about when she said this is a myth that has been debunked. Go to the polls Under current law, background checks are required in sales by federally licensed gun dealers, but the checks are not required for gun sales by private sellers. National polls conducted in 2015 consistently show that around 90 percent of Americans support some sort of expanded background checks for gun purchases. Here are a few examples: Quinnipiac University poll, conducted Dec. 16-20: ""Would you support or oppose a law requiring background checks on people buying guns at gun shows or online?"" Support: 89 percent. Oppose: 9 percent. Unsure/No answer: 1 percent. CBS/New York Times poll, conducted Oct. 21-25: ""Do you favor or oppose a federal law requiring background checks on all potential gun buyers?"" Favor: 92 percent. Oppose: 7 percent. Unsure/No answer: 1 percent. Gallup poll, conducted Oct. 7-11: ""Would you favor or oppose a law which would require universal background checks for all gun purchases in the U.S. using a centralized database across all 50 states?"" Favor: 86 percent. Oppose: 12 percent. Unsure: 2 percent. Quinnipiac University poll, conducted Sept. 17-21: ""Do you support or oppose requiring background checks for all gun buyers?"" Support: 93 percent. Oppose: 6 percent. Unsure/No answer: 1 percent. Pew Research Center poll, conducted July 14-20: Do you favor or oppose ""making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks""? Favor: 85 percent. Oppose: 13 percent. Unsure/Refused: 2 percent. Pew found that support for background checks spans all partisan and demographic groups, and it is also favored by a majority of households that own guns and those that do not. So are all of these polls wrong? We reached out to Ingraham’s producers and didn’t hear back. We couldn’t find any sort of definitive debunking of this stat, but we did find that some gun rights advocates have taken issue with this statistic for reasons such as the survey questions referring to the general idea of background checks rather than specific legislation. For example, in 2013, polls found that 90 percent of Americans supported expanded background checks. However, when Congress failed to pass a popular bill that would have increased background checks, 47 percent were disappointed or angry that it failed, while some 39 percent were relieved or very happy, according to a Washington Post/Pew Research Center poll. Some gun rights activists took this as proof that the 90 percent figure was phooey. This highlights an odd discrepancy: While people overwhelmingly support specific gun policy ideas, like universal background checks and banning suspected terrorists from buying guns, the support is not as robust when it comes to actually expanding gun control. The same October CBS/New York Times poll that found 92 percent support for expanded background checks also shows 46 percent of Americans think laws covering gun sales should be either made less strict or stay the same. Just 51 percent said the laws should be made more strict. ""People don't seem to like the idea of ‘gun control,’ but they still want the government to do more to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill,"" said Adam Winkler, a law professor at the University of California Los Angeles and author of Gunfight: The Battle over the Right to Bear Arms in America. Our ruling Ingraham said, ""The 90 percent statistic of supporting background checks, that's been debunked."" Numerous respected polls from 2015 show around 90 percent support for some sort of expanded background checks for gun purchases. While there are some questions as to what inferences can be made from these findings — such as whether that 90-percent support translates into support for specific legislation — there hasn’t been a definitive debunking of the statistic",False,"January 5, 2016"
"""Everywhere that we have more citizens carrying guns, crime is less. There's a study showing that where states have open carry or concealed carry, but particularly open carry, the crime is down 25 percent.""","President Barack Obama may be considering executive action on gun sales in his final year in the White House, but Texas’ lieutenant governor says his state shows why the country needs less gun control, not more. Texas became the 45th state to allow concealed-carry permit holders to openly tote their firearms on Jan. 1. Concealed carry has been allowed in the state since the 1990s with basically ""zero problems,"" Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said on NBC’s Meet the Press. ""Everywhere that we have more citizens carrying guns, crime is less,"" Patrick said Jan. 3. ""There's a study showing that where states have open carry or concealed carry, but particularly open carry, the crime is down 25 percent. Murders are down. Having law-abiding citizens having guns is a good thing."" Is it true that states with concealed carry have seen a 25 percent decline in crime? The evidence for such a sweeping statement, we found, is lacking. Correlation, not causation Patrick’s statement reminded us of a very similar claim by Florida state Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fort Walton Beach, who said, ""In the states that allow open carry, violent crime was 23 percent lower."" Gaetz crunched the numbers himself, comparing the rate of violent crimes (murder, forcible rape, robbery and aggravated assault) in the 42 states that allowed open carry in 2012 with the eight states that didn’t. While his math technically checks out, experts told PolitiFact Florida that Gaetz’s statistic is meaningless, as you can’t really draw conclusions about the impact of a single law with data from a single year. But Patrick cited a ""study,"" not Gaetz’s napkin calculations. He did not get back to us by deadline, but he could be referencing one by economist John Lott, president of the pro-gun Crime Prevention Research Center, and flubbing some of the details. Lott’s research — which was not published in a peer-reviewed journal but on the Crime Prevention Research Center’s website — looked at the increase in concealed-carry permits but did not discuss open carry, as Patrick mentioned on air. And the 25 percent refers to a decrease in murder rates across the nation as well as a decline in violent crime. According to the study, the number of concealed-handgun permits across the country has increased by 178 percent from 4.6 million to 12.8 million from 2007 to 2015. Meanwhile, national murder rates have fallen from 2007 to 2014 by 25 percent, from 5.6 to 4.2 homicides per 100,000. ""Overall, violent crime also fell by 25 percent over that time period,"" Lott writes, though he doesn’t give the numbers behind this rate in the study. In an interview with PolitiFact, Lott noted that the third edition of his book More Guns, Less Crime, shows that murder rates decreased 1.5 percent every year after concealed-carry legislation was passed, while robberies and rapes declined by 2 percent. Over 10 years, that comes out to about 15 to 20 percent, he said. Experts said that the study notes an ""association"" but doesn’t actually show causation between increased gun ownership and fewer murders or less crime. Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, called Patrick’s claim ""ridiculous"" and pointed out another coinciding trend. ""Mass shootings have more than doubled over that time,"" said Webster. ""But I don’t make the claim that more gun carriers have led to more mass shootings."" A peer-reviewed study in the Journal of Criminology directly refuted Lott’s findings (and Lott in turn criticized that research). Researchers at Texas A&M University looked at county-level crime data in Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Texas from 1998 to 2010 — the only four states with at least a decade’s worth of data after concealed-carry legislation was passed.   While all the states saw an increase in the amount of concealed-carry permits, the crime trends varied. Rape and burglary decreased across all four states from 1998 to 2010, and murder decreased in Michigan and Texas. However, robbery, aggravated assault and larceny increased in Michigan and Pennsylvania while murder increased in Florida and Pennsylvania.   ""We found no effect of increases in (concealed-carry permits) issued in a county on changes in crime rates,"" Charles Phillips, a public health professor at Texas A&M and lead author of the study, told PolitiFact. An inconclusive theory at best The ""more guns, less crime"" theory largely stems from Lott’s highly influential and equally controversial book of the same name, which analyzed 30 years’ worth of crime data. More than a decade after its first publication, the theory continues to be the subject of heated academic and policy debate as well as numerous fact-checks. Lott contends the ""vast majority"" of research supports his work, but some researchers say he’s been discredited. Major critiques in the Stanford Law Review and by the National Research Council note that the evidence does not show a causal link between the passage of right-to-carry laws and crime rates. ""The only real dispute is whether the benefits and the costs of these (right-to-carry) laws are a wash or whether they lead to increases in violent crime,"" said Stanford Law professor John Donohue, a vocal critic of Lott’s work. Donohue’s own influential 2014 working paper shows an increase in violent crime in 22 states. According to Donohue, much of the national decline in crime came from New York, a state that has no right-to-carry law. Webster of Johns Hopkins pointed out that permit holders are low-risk when it comes to involvement in violent crime, so it’s counter-intuitive to suggest that they’re the cause of a decline in murders. That holds true in Patrick’s home state of Texas, where concealed-carry licensees commit very few crimes, said Phillips of Texas A&M, based on his own research. ""But when convicted, they are more likely to be crimes involving violence, guns and death."" Finally, experts have pointed to a lot of theories beyond right-to-carry laws that may account for falling crime rates,including improved police technology, mass incarceration, online financial practices that keeps paper money out of homes, and extended unemployment benefits. So it's not as if the crime is falling because of loose gun restrictions alone. Our ruling Patrick said, ""There's a study showing that where states have open carry or concealed carry, but particularly open carry, the crime is down 25 percent."" It’s possible that Patrick is referencing a disputed study by gun rights advocate John Lott and getting some details wrong. Lott’s study shows a 25 percent decrease in murder and violent crime across the country from 2007 to 2014, as well as a 178 percent rise in the number of concealed-carry permits. Those two trends may be correlated, but experts say there’s no evidence showing causation. Further, gun laws may have little to nothing to do with rates of falling crime",Mostly False,"January 3, 2016"
"""91% of suspected terrorists who attempted to buy guns in America walked away with the weapon they wanted.""","U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy joined other Democrats in demanding the House take up a bill that would keep people on the FBI’s watch list from buying guns, saying far too many people on the list have been allowed to get firearms. Murphy tweeted a graphic on Dec. 8, 2015, claiming that ""91 percent of suspected terrorists who attempted to buy guns in America walked away with the weapon they wanted."" His tweet came after Republicans repeatedly blocked a bill that would keep people on the FBI list from buying guns. In an unusual procedural move, Murphy and other Democrats signed a petition to bring the bill to the House floor, but it currently doesn’t have the required 218 signatures for further action. The Senate earlier in December struck down a similar bill. We were curious if Murphy -- who is also running in the Democratic primary for U.S. Senate in 2016 -- was right to say that 91 percent of suspected terrorists looking to buy guns were able to get one. Our research showed that is accurate by the best available estimates, but there are some caveats about the watch list we should keep in mind. Watching the watch list The FBI maintains what is informally known as the terrorist watch list through its Terrorist Screening Center, which maintains a consolidated file of ""those known or reasonably suspected of being involved in terrorist activity."" As you can imagine, some critics are uneasy about the government maintaining any sort of list designating people potential enemies of the state, but it’s generally considered a valuable tool for national security. The Democrats’ bill allows for cross-referencing the list while conducting a background check for a firearm purchase. The actual size of the list and who is on it is not public information, but we have estimates: In 2011, an FBI fact sheet said there were 420,000 people on the list. Current estimates have put the list at around 700,000. Since the database pulls information from U.S. and global agencies, only a relative handful — about 8,400 in 2011 and likely around 10,000 now — are American citizens or legal residents. Murphy’s stat comes from a March 2015 report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office, which examined how many people applying for gun purchases were run through the FBI’s instant background checks and also were on the watch list. Between February 2004 (when the FBI started keeping tabs on people on the list trying to buy guns) and December 2014, there were 2,233 people on the list who applied to buy a weapon. Of those, 2,043 were allowed to proceed, including three applications to buy explosives. That’s a bit more than 91 percent. Experts have told PolitiFact that the GAO report is plausible, and not really that remarkable, considering how many gun purchases Americans have made in the past decade. But there are things to keep in mind. The data show how many weapons applications there were, not how many individuals, so one person could have potentially made several purchases. The report also didn’t show transactions made at gun shows, where federal background checks aren’t conducted, so the number actually could be higher. There also have been some issues with the terror watchlist database in the past. A 2009 U.S. Justice Department audit showed that 35 percent of the people on the list were ""associated with FBI cases that did not contain current international terrorist or domestic terrorism designations"" and should have been removed from the list. There also are multiple entries for slight variations of the same name, which has previously led to people with the same name as a person on the watch list being stopped at airports, a problem that experts say has largely been resolved. Our ruling Murphy said, ""91 percent of suspected terrorists who attempted to buy guns in America walked away with the weapon they wanted."" His figure comes from a GAO report that showed a bit more than 91 percent of gun store weapons applications by people on the FBI’s terrorist watch list were approved. There are some caveats to the watch list, including past issues with who is included and why. The report also didn’t distinguish how many individuals are making these applications, or how many people on the watch list potentially buy firearms at gun shows. But experts have told us the report is both plausible and not altogether unsurprising, given how many guns Americans purchase",Mostly True,"December 29, 2015"
"""Secretary Clinton changes her position on (gun issues) every election year, it seems, having one position in 2000 and then campaigning against President Obama and saying we don't need federal standards.""","Hillary Clinton goes wherever the wind blows on gun control, former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley said at a Democratic presidential debate in New Hampshire. ""Secretary Clinton changes her position on this every election year, it seems, having one position in 2000 and then campaigning against President (Barack) Obama and saying we don't need federal standards,"" O’Malley said at the Dec. 19, 2015, debate hosted by ABC News. In the wake of several mass shootings this year, Clinton has pushed for stronger federal gun control, so we decided to look back and see if O’Malley is correct that she had a different position on the issue in the past. O’Malley’s campaign sent us several news articles detailing Clinton’s stance on guns. Pre-2008 From the time she was first lady through her 2000 Senate run in New York, Clinton supported strict federal gun control measures. In 1993, then-President Bill Clinton signed into law the Brady bill, which mandated federal background checks and a waiting period for gun purchases, as well as an assault weapons ban that expired in 2004. As first lady, Hillary Clinton supported these measures. ""The first step is to take weapons off the streets and to put more police on them,"" she wrote in her 1996 book It Takes a Village. ""Since (the Brady bill) was enacted, more than 40,000 people with criminal records have been prevented from buying guns."" Following the Columbine, Colo., school shooting in April 1999, Clinton pushed for more gun control, including a proposal to raise the legal age to own a handgun from 18 to 21. And during her 2000 Senate run, Clinton endorsed gun registration, photo licenses for gun owners and ballistic fingerprinting. Clinton continued to push for more gun control while serving as the senator from New York, but in her 2008 presidential run, she seemed to back off a bit. 2008 Positioning herself to the right of then-Sen. Barack Obama, Clinton spoke throughout the campaign about the importance of guns to American culture while still defending Bill Clinton’s record on gun control. ""You know, my dad took me out behind the cottage that my grandfather built on a little lake called Lake Winola outside of Scranton and taught me how to shoot when I was a little girl,"" she said at a town hall in 2008. At a 2008 Democratic debate in Las Vegas, Clinton gave an affirmative ""yes"" that she was backing off her 2000 call for a national licensing and registration plan because it would ""preempt"" cities and states’ initiatives. But she also called for reinstating the assault weapons ban and better background checks for potential gun purchasers. Clinton responded to another question about her position on a gun registry at a debate in Philadelphia. ""What might work in New York City is certainly not going to work in Montana,"" she said, explaining her reason to abandon the proposal. ""So, for the federal government to be having any kind of, you know, blanket rules that they're going to try to impose, I think doesn't make sense."" ""I respect the Second Amendment. I respect the rights of lawful gun owners to own guns, to use their guns,"" she went on to say later in the debate. ""But I also believe that most lawful gun owners whom I have spoken with for many years across our country also want to be sure that we keep those guns out of the wrong hands."" While Clinton clearly was no longer in favor of a gun registry out of professed concern for individual states’ needs, she did not wholly reject all federal gun laws. 2016 More so than in her 2008 campaign, Clinton has been forceful and impassioned about gun control this cycle, pushing for universal background checks, closing the so-called gun show loophole, and a bill that aims to stop people on the no-fly list from purchasing guns, among several other measures. ""This epidemic of gun violence knows no boundaries,"" she said in a recent campaign ad. ""We’re better than this. We need to close the loopholes and support universal background checks. How many people have to die before we actually act? Before we come together as a nation?"" Clinton’s list of the gun control measures she would support does not, though, include the gun licensing and registration program she advocated for in 2000 but backed off of in 2008. In sum, O’Malley does have a point that Clinton’s rhetoric and her position on a few specific gun control measures shifted from 2000 to 2008, and then from 2008 to 2015. But in her 2008 campaign, she was not really against all ""federal standards"" because she still called for some federal gun control measures, such as reinstating the assault weapons ban. Our ruling O’Malley ""Secretary Clinton changes her position on (gun issues) every election year, it seems, having one position in 2000 and then campaigning against President Obama and saying we don't need federal standards."" In 2000, in the wake of the Columbine school shooting, Clinton was emphatic about her support for gun control. In 2008, she dropped her support for a gun license and registration proposal and positioned herself to the right of her major opponent, Obama. While Clinton also advocated for leaving some gun control to the states, she still advocated for federal gun control efforts, and she never said ""we don’t need federal standards."" In 2015, Clinton has been more forceful with her support for gun control than she was in 2008 -- closer to her rhetoric in 2000. O’Malley has a point that Clinton’s positioning on gun control has shifted between election cycles, but it wasn’t nearly as dramatic as he made it out to be",Half True,"December 19, 2015"
"""Since 2004, more than 2,000 suspected terrorists have legally purchased weapons in the United States."""," Every year, millions of average Americans legally buy guns in this country. But have thousands of people on the FBI’s Terrorist Watch List also legally purchased guns, and other weapons, on U.S. soil? That’s the claim Rep. Mike Thompson, D-St. Helena, made following the terrorist attack in San Bernardino. Thompson and others in Congress called for a ban on weapons purchases by anyone on the watch list. The U.S. Senate struck down a bill that sought to accomplish that earlier this month. ""Since 2004, more than 2,000 suspected terrorists have legally purchased weapons in the United States,"" Thompson said on floor of the House of Representatives on Dec. 7, urging passage of the bill.  Was this true? We decided to fact-check the eye-opening statement. But first, we wanted to learn more about the list itself. The list, which includes the smaller No Fly List, is a database comprising information about ""those known or reasonably suspected of being involved in terrorist activity,"" according to the FBI. National security officials consider it a key tool in preventing future attacks. Civil liberty groups and some elected leaders have called it unconstitutional, citing a lack of due process and vague standards for inclusion on the list. It’s caused headaches at airport security checkpoints for people with similar names to those on the list, including the late Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass., and Rep. Tom McClintock, R-Elk Grove. The database is believed to include hundreds of thousands of individuals, including roughly 10,000 Americans. But being on the list as a ""suspected terrorist"" does not mean the person has a criminal record, or has ever been charged with a crime. It just means they’re ""reasonably suspected"" by a federal official of being involved in terrorist activity. Our Research We know it’s legal for suspected terrorists to buy weapons — specifically, guns — because that’s the right Thompson and even President Obama have said they want to take away. But how are purchases by suspected terrorists tracked? And how can anyone know for certain that ""more than 2,000"" have legally bought weapons over the past decade in the U.S.? Enter the FBI. The federal agency conducts instant criminal background checks on people seeking to buy firearms at licensed gun stores. In 2004, these checks began examining whether an applicant was on the terrorist watch list.  Photo by Andrew Nixon/Capital Public Radio In March, the U.S. Government Accountability Office published an analysis of FBI data showing that from February 2004 through December 2014, 2,043 out of 2,233 weapons applications by people on the terrorist watch list were allowed to proceed. Nearly all applications were for firearms. Three were for explosives, all of which were approved. When we contacted Thompson’s office, a staffer pointed us to the GAO analysis to back up the congressman’s claim. The GAO found an average of about 200 successful weapons purchases by the group of people on the list, each year, during the timeframe. Experts we spoke with told us there’s no way of independently verifying information on the list, as it’s not public. They referred to the GAO analysis as the best estimate available. ""I have no means of independently confirming who is a reasonable suspect even if I knew the names. I imagine this is true of most average persons. We have to go on trust,"" Martha Crenshaw, Stanford University political science professor and expert on terrorism, said in an email. The FBI has declined to comment on the watch list’s current size, but we found an estimate on a 2011 FBI fact-sheet that put it at 420,000 individuals. Of those, only about 8,400 were American citizens or legal residents. Current estimates of the number of people on the list -- foreign and American combined -- now hover around 700,000. A 'plausible number' Two experts who helped oversee the watch list told us the congressman’s claim of ""more than 2,000"" suspected terrorists legally buying weapons over 10 years is realistic. ""That’s certainly a plausible number,"" said Martin Reardon, former chief of the FBI Terrorist Screening Center’s operations branch. The screening center maintains the watch list. Reardon, who now works for an intelligence consulting firm, estimated the number of Americans on it is currently no more than 10,000. Another expert knowledgeable about the list agreed. ""Two thousand, over such a long period of time -- 10 years -- does not actually strike me as being overly large because there are a lot of people in this country that are purchasing firearms,"" said Timothy Edgar, who oversaw civil liberties and national intelligence issues, including the terrorist watch list, under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. ""So it’s not surprising that there’s been a fairly substantial number of encounters with people who are on that terrorist watch list for one reason or another, over the past decade."" The data show weapons applications, not the number of individuals making those requests. So presumably, the same person could have made multiple applications. Even so, the experts said, the number cited by Thompson could be much higher. Suspected terrorists could have legally bought weapons at gun shows, where transactions are not subject to federal background checks. Faulty list? While there’s data to back up Thompson’s claim, it’s also important to consider the accuracy of the names on the terror watch list. How do we know, for example, that the people on the list really are ""suspected terrorists?"" In 2009, the U.S. Department of Justice’s Office of the Inspector General released an audit  that found that 35 percent of the identities on the watch list at the time were ""associated with FBI cases that did not contain current international terrorism or domestic terrorism designations."" Many of the records were for people who had originally ""been appropriately watchlisted but should have been removed from the watchlist after the case had been closed,"" the audit said. The American Civil Liberties Union has repeatedly criticized what it calls the ""unconstitutionally vague"" standards for inclusion on the terror watch list. It repeated a call earlier this month for major reforms of the database. Edgar and Reardon both acknowledged the list is ""not perfect."" Edgar added, however, that many of the early problems with the list, which caused some people with the same name as a suspected terrorist to be stopped at airports, have been resolved. Even if a large chunk of the names on the list are outdated, we presume a majority truly are ""suspected terrorists,"" based on our research and that of the experts we spoke with. Our Ruling Rep. Mike Thompson said recently on the House floor that: ""Since 2004, more than 2,000 suspected terrorists have legally purchased weapons in the U.S."" He backed up his claim with FBI data that show 2,043 people on the agency’s terror watch list successfully applied for weapons at licensed gun shops over the past decade. There’s no way to track how many people on the list legally bought weapons at gun shows, as those transactions aren’t subject to federal background checks. But it makes sense to assume some did. The congressman left out the fact that a federal audit in 2009 found 35 percent of the identities on the list had no ties to current terrorism cases. The audit said many of the names remained on the list when they should have been removed. But given the large size of the terror watch list — with perhaps 10,000 Americans and hundreds of thousands of foreigners — it’s reasonable to assume that 200 or more on the list made legal weapons purchases each year over the past decade",Mostly True,"December 17, 2015"
"The Charleston, S.C., shooter ""should have never been given a gun, but the universal background check was not fast enough.""","Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton defended her call for stricter gun control in the wake of the mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif. Clinton’s Republican rivals have criticized her for pushing gun control following a terrorist attack. But lax firearms laws, Clinton said on ABC’s This Week, allow people on the no-fly list to purchase guns, just as they enabled Dylann Roof, accused of killing nine African-Americans in a Charleston, S.C., church attack in June. ""(Roof) should have never have been given a gun, but the universal background check was not fast enough,"" Clinton said Dec. 6. ""We should be able to approach both of these with some sense of, you know, unity about how we prevent terrorist attacks and how we prevent the wrong people from getting ahold of guns."" Is Clinton right that this system didn’t catch the Charleston shooter in time? She omits some important details in her description, but it largely checks out. How Roof obtained a gun Under current federal law, the FBI performs background checks on would-be gun buyers in South Carolina and 29 other states through its National Instant Criminal Background Check System (the rest of the states do their own background checks). If the check isn’t denied or completed in three days, the gun seller can proceed with the sale. What happened in Roof’s case comes down to clerical errors. Here’s how FBI Director James Comey explained why Roof’s background check wasn’t finished in time to prevent his purchase of a .45-caliber Glock pistol. Roof tried to buy a handgun in West Columbia, S.C., a suburb of Columbia, on April 11. A West Virginia-based FBI examiner began vetting him the next business day, April 13, and found that Roof had been arrested for a felony drug charge March 1 (the charge was later corrected as a misdemeanor). Because the records didn’t show a conviction, the examiner couldn’t deny the purchase but continued to look into Roof’s criminal history. Roof’s rap sheet mistakenly listed the neighboring county’s sheriff office as the agency that arrested him, leading the FBI examiner to request more information on Roof from the wrong county sheriff’s and prosecutor’s offices. The examiner then contacted the West Columbia police, who replied they had no records of Roof’s arrest. Had the database listed the correct police station (Columbia) or included the report in which Roof admitted to possessing drugs, things would have turned out different, according to Comey. ""If a NICS examiner saw that, Roof would be denied permission to buy a gun. But the examiner never saw that,"" he said. When the three days were up on April 16, the case was still listed as ""pending"" and Roof was able to purchase the gun. Two months later, on June 17, Roof allegedly shot and killed nine worshippers and injured one in a historically black church in Charleston. Clerical error or ‘Charleston loophole’ Both sides of the gun debate came to very different conclusions about this news. Clinton and some advocates for tighter gun laws argued Roof was abetted by the three-day time limit for background checks, dubbing it the ""Charleston loophole."" Supporters of gun rights say the onus is actually on the FBI and its botched paperwork. Daniel Webster, the director of the Center for Gun Policy and Research at Johns Hopkins University, agrees with Clinton that the FBI would have been able to catch Roof’s conviction if it had more than three days to track down the details. ""The follow-up investigation found that the FBI analyst doing the check was still in the process of tracking down the information on the case and hadn’t given up because of the clerical error,"" Webster said. CNN reported that FBI examiners officially denied Roof’s gun purchase application a week after the shooting, when he was already in custody. Usually when the FBI denies a gun purchase after the fact, the agency notifies the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which then retrieves the firearm. In 2014, the FBI denied approximately 1.1 percent, or 91,000, of would-be gun purchases within three days. Of the transactions that required more than three days to vet, the FBI referred 2,511 for retrieval. Back in 2000, the Government Accountability Office reported it took an average of 25 business days for the FBI to determine whether a gun purchase should have been denied. We could not find more recent data. Our ruling Clinton said the Charleston shooter ""should have never have been given a gun, but the universal background check was not fast enough."" Dylann Roof admitted to a drug offense a few weeks before he tried to buy a gun, so the FBI said he should have been denied one. However, it wasn’t the three-day time limit by itself that undermined Roof’s background check. There were clerical errors in the FBI’s database that prevented the examiner from seeing Roof’s drug admission. Clinton’s characterization misses some important information about Roof’s case",Mostly True,"December 6, 2015"
"""There are over 700,000 Americans on some watch list or another that would all be captured"" in a Democratic amendment intended to stop suspected terrorists from buying guns.","Democrats’ proposed legislation to stop terrorists from buying guns would unintentionally harm the Second Amendment rights of everyday Americans, said presidential candidate Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. Rubio and other Senate Republicans voted down legislation that allowed the attorney general to ban ""known or suspected dangerous terrorists"" from obtaining firearms or explosives. Under current law, thousands of people on the FBI’s terrorist watch list have been able to purchase such weapons legally. But the terrorist watch list sometimes includes people who aren’t actually terrorists, Rubio said on CNN’s State of the Union Dec. 6, and it would be wrong to deny those people their right to own a gun. ""If these were perfect lists, that would be one thing,"" he said. ""But there are over 700,000 Americans on some watch list or another that would all be captured under this amendment the Democrats offered. And that's the problem."" We wondered if there were really 700,000 Americans who could potentially get caught up on a terrorist watch list and be prevented from buying guns under Democratic legislation. Rubio’s count is way off. The number of Americans on the consolidated terrorist watch list is likely in the thousands, not hundreds of thousands. We reached out to Rubio’s team, but they didn’t get back to us. By the numbers The FBI’s Terrorist Screening Center maintains what is colloquially known as the terrorist watch list. The Terrorist Screening Database is a consolidated collection of information about people known or reasonably suspected to have some level of involvement in terrorist activities. The no-fly list is a subset of the terrorist watch list. The terrorist watch list is the one the attorney general would pull from when deciding whether someone should be denied a firearm if there’s reasonable belief that the person would use that firearm for terrorism, under the Democrats’ bill, said Ashley Schapitl, spokeswoman for bill sponsor Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif. The terrorist watch list pulls information from numerous government agencies in the United States and around the world, so American citizens and legal residents only make up a portion of the list. A pretty small portion, in fact. A Terrorist Screening Center spokesman declined to comment on the watch list’s current size, but we found an estimate on a 2011 FBI fact-sheet that put it at 420,000 individuals. Of those, only about 8,400 were American citizens or legal residents. The no-fly list subset included about 16,000 names, only 500 of whom were Americans. Current estimates of the number of people on the list -- foreign and American combined -- now hover around 700,000, the number Rubio cited. But there’s no way that the number of Americans on the list has grown to 700,000, said Timothy Edgar, who oversaw civil liberties and national intelligence issues, including the terrorist watch list, under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. ""Rubio is almost certainly off by orders of magnitude,"" said Edgar, now a visiting fellow at Brown University. The number of Americans on the list likely doesn’t exceed 10,000, said Martin Reardon, former chief of the FBI Terrorist Screening Center’s operations branch. Some innocent people have been wrongly included in the terrorist watch list or the no-fly list, which can affect their lives in ways such as having to go through extra airport security or being stopped from boarding a plane. But for an American to get on that list by accident is ""harder than people think,"" added Reardon, who is now a vice president at the Soufan Group, a consulting firm. It’s more likely that a person would have the same name as someone who is on the list, and that person could run into problems at the airport if a security agent makes a misidentification, Reardon said. This happened to the late Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass., who once wasn’t allowed to fly because he had a similar name to the alias of a suspected terrorist on the no-fly list. But the problem of same names is less common than it used to be, and there is a reasonably efficient redress process for people to appeal to the government to get their name removed from the terrorist watch list, Edgar noted. ""That shows that the redress process is not a sham, but it also shows that a fairly significant number of people are put on the watchlist by mistake,"" he said. Still, it’s nowhere close to 700,000 Americans. Our ruling Rubio said, ""There are over 700,000 Americans on some watch list or another that would all be captured"" in a Democratic amendment intended to stop suspected terrorists from buying guns. Under the Democrats’ proposal, the attorney general would have some discretion in denying firearms to people on the FBI’s consolidated terrorist watchlist. While it’s reasonable to estimate that there are 700,000 people on this list, only a small fraction are American citizens or legal residents. Experts said it’s likely that only about 10,000 are Americans, while the rest are foreigners",Mostly False,"December 6, 2015"
"Oregon’s Umpqua Community College ""where the shooting occurred was a gun-free zone.""","The sponsor of a bill that would allow concealed weapons on Florida’s college campuses said his legislation would help prevent mass shootings like the attack at Oregon’s Umpqua Community College, which he described as a gun-free zone. Whether the school was a gun-free zone or not emerged as a point of contention at a Nov. 19 House Judiciary Committee hearing on HB 4001. Its sponsor, state Rep. Greg Steube, R-Sarasota, disagreed with testimony against the bill from Austin Engelbrecht, a lobbyist for Florida State University. Engelbrecht said Oregon law allows students to bring guns on campuses, but it was still the police, not a gun owner, who stopped the Umpqua attack. Steube responded that guns were not allowed at Oregon schools. ""Oregon is a gun-free zone. The state of Oregon allows each university the ability to decide for themselves whether it's a gun-free zone or not,"" Steube said. ""The community college where the shooting occurred was a gun-free zone. Don't believe me, look it up on your cell phones."" We decided to figure out whether Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Ore., allowed guns on its campus or not. Exception to the rule Christopher Harper-Mercer, a 26-year-old enrolled at Umpqua, killed eight students and an assistant professor and injured nine others before police arrived and wounded him in a shootout on Oct. 1, 2015. Harper-Mercer then killed himself, ending the deadliest mass shooting in Oregon’s modern history. Some gun rights advocates said the shooting could have been prevented if campuses weren’t gun-free zones — that is, the schools restrict students, teachers or anyone else from having a gun on school property. Steube used the shooting as an example of why HB 4001 is necessary, citing an Umpqua policy that bars guns from campus and therefore exposed students to danger. The school’s student code of conduct lists the ""possession or use, without written authorization, of firearms,"" among other weapons and dangerous chemicals or devices, on college property or at college-sponsored events as a punishable offense. There’s a similar policy spelled out on Umpqua’s website. The clause ""without written authorization"" is important. There is a policy prohibiting guns at Umpqua Community College, as Steube said. But students are allowed to have guns on campus if they have a concealed carry permit — essentially what Steube’s HB 4001 wants to codify in Florida. His bill, which cleared the committee process to be heard in the 2016 legislative session, would apply to all colleges and universities, which would not be able to restrict concealed carry permit holders from carrying guns. While the Oregon University System banned guns in the 1970s, a concealed weapons law from 1989 said only the state’s Legislature can make rules on gun possession. The law was at the center of a challenge by a Western Oregon University student who was suspended in 2009 for bringing a concealed handgun on campus. The student had a permit for the gun. The Oregon Court of Appeals ruled in 2011 that the university system’s ban was beyond its authority and was invalid, so concealed carry permit holders could bring weapons on campus. (Having the gun out in the open was still not allowed.) Oregon is currently one of eight states that allow students to carry concealed handguns on postsecondary campuses — the others are Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Mississippi, Utah, Wisconsin and Texas, which recently passed a bill that takes effect in August 2016. Legally speaking, community colleges can neither arm their own security guards nor remove people with guns from campus. On Nov. 9, Umpqua began paying for an armed sheriff’s deputy to act as armed security, because the school couldn’t directly hire an armed guard. Steube acknowledged the 2011 Oregon court ruling to PolitiFact Florida, but he said schools are now allowed to set their own policies prohibiting weapons. ""I stated in committee that state law allows (concealed) carry in Oregon but the school banned guns,"" Steube told PolitiFact Florida via email. ""My statement was an accurate reflection of the law and policy."" The State Board of Higher Education in 2012 did create a policy that banned students, employees, contractors, ticketholders to university events and people renting university property from carrying guns on university property, according to The Oregonian newspaper. If someone had a concealed carry permit, they could bring the gun on campus, but he or she could not take it into a building or sports venue. There were exceptions for police, ROTC members, people in off-campus housing, and shooting and hunting clubs. But keep in mind, that policy was for the state’s seven universities, not its 17 community colleges. Their governing boards each set their own rules. Umpqua’s ban on guns doesn’t prevent students with a valid concealed weapons permit from bringing guns on campus. Umpqua Community College spokeswoman Anne Marie Levis told us the school’s gun-free policy didn’t apply to students with a valid permit. ""UCC was never designated as a ‘gun-free zone’ by any signage or policy,"" she said. ""Umpqua Community College does comply with state law by allowing students with concealed carry licenses to bring firearms on campus."" It has been widely reported that students with firearms were on the Umpqua campus on the day Harper-Mercer attacked. One particularly harrowing account included the experience of student John Parker, an Army veteran who was carrying a concealed handgun on Oct. 1. ""When I got into the room that was locked down, one of the professors asked if anyone was concealed carry,"" Parker told Reuters. ""I raised my hand and said: ‘Don’t worry, nobody is coming through that door.’ "" Parker was in a building away from the shooting. He told MSNBC that a professor convinced him to stay put lest he be targeted by the shooter or mistaken for the suspect by police responding to 911 calls. Our ruling Steube said Oregon’s Umpqua Community College ""was a gun-free zone."" The school does have a policy generally prohibiting firearms on campus. However, Oregon law allows for students with valid concealed carry permits to bring guns on school grounds with some restrictions. An Umpqua official confirmed that students with concealed carry licenses are allowed to bring them on campus in compliance with state law, just as Steube wants to see in Florida. Steube’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression",Mostly False,"November 24, 2015"
"""29 mass shootings have been committed by concealed carriers since 2007, while during this period only one (1) licensed civilian meaningfully intervened in a mass shooting.""","When Texas lawmakers agreed to allow people to carry concealed handguns in college and university buildings, the law included wiggle room for school presidents and boards to determine rules and regulations for their campuses. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed Senate Bill 11 - the ""campus carry"" measure - into law on June 1, 2015, but the rancorous debate over whether the law willl prevent mass shootings continues. Some groups are using risque tactics to draw attention to their opposition, like the student-organized ""Campus Dildo Carry"" day, scheduled to take place next summer at the University of Texas in Austin. Gun Free UT, which opposes the law, is taking a more serious approach in its opposition, in part through a website that drew our attention thanks to this claim posted Oct. 28, 2015: ""29 mass shootings have been committed by concealed carriers since 2007, while during this period only one (1) licensed civilian meaningfully intervened in a mass shooting."" The same day, we took a screenshot of the blog post containing the claim, headlined ""Guns in Classrooms: Report from the trenches and tasks."" After we asked for some clarification on the relationship between the two sources cited in the claim, the post was taken down. Joan Neuberger, UT professor of history and a co-chair of the Gun Free UT steering committee, said the claim made on the site in a bullet point left no room for nuance. ""We can see that our statement needs more context."" Still, is the claim -- suggesting mass shooters won’t be stopped even if more students carry weapons -- accurate? We looked first at whether 29 mass shootings have been committed by licensed concealed carriers since 2007. Then we turned to whether only one licensed civilian ""meaningfully"" intervened in a mass shooting in the period. Counting mass shootings In an Oct. 28, 2015 post, The Washington Post’s Wonkblog cited an Oct. 14, 2015 report from the Violence Policy Center, a research and advocacy group that promotes gun control, stating that since 2007, there had been 29 mass shootings by people with concealed weapons in the U.S. The National Rifle Association, which backed SB 11, has taken issue with the center’s breakdown. NRA Institute for Legislative Action spokesman Lars Dalseide directed us to a criticism of the center’s methodology on Bearing Arms, a Second Amendment rights advocacy blog. The Oct. 26, 2015 Bearing Arms post looks at each of the shootings compiled by the center and concludes that only six instances were actually mass shootings committed by concealed carry permit holders using concealed weapons. That’s a whopping difference. So what gives? For one thing, the Violence Policy Center and Bearing Arms define ""mass shootings"" differently. In its analysis, the center defined a mass shooting as the killing of three people or more. According to VPC Communications Director Avery Palmer, this definition is ""consistent with the federal definition contained in the Investigative Assistance for Violent Crimes Act of 2012."" This is also the definition used in ""A Study of Active Shooter Incidents in the United States Between 2000 and 2013,"" the FBI report from which Gun Free UT pulls its statistic on civilian interventions. On the other hand, the Bearing Arms post author, Bob Owens, defines a mass killing as the killing of four people or more, thus disregarding incidents in which three people were killed. His definition is actually consistent with the FBI definition of a mass murder (as opposed to a mass shooting). In a 2005 report on serial murder, the FBI defined mass murder as ""a number of murders (four or more) occurring during the same incident."" Only one civilian intervened? We come to the second part of the claim, that ""during this period (since 2007), only one licensed civilian meaningfully intervened in a mass shooting."" Gun Free UT pulls this figure from the aforementioned FBI study on active-shooter incidents. It’s worth noting that while Gun Free UT implies the FBI report contains data on interventions from 2007 through the present, it actually only examines incidents through 2013. According to the report, there were five instances in which ""the shooting ended after armed individuals who were not law enforcement personnel exchanged gunfire with the shooters."" Gun Free UT did not count four of these incidents because the intervening civilians were security guards armed for their jobs. When we took a closer look at the one case where an armed civilian stopped the shooting, we found something interesting. The FBI report didn’t just look at mass shootings -- it focused on all ""active shooter incidents"" (in which ""an individual actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people in a confined and populated area"") during a 13-year period. As it turns out, the situation cited by Gun Free UT was not what either the center or the FBI would define as a mass shooting in that two people died, rather than three. In that case, Ernesto Villagomez, 30,  killed two people and wounded two more inside Player’s Bar and Grill in Winnemucca, Nevada. He was then shot and killed by another patron at the bar. Other analyses Unlike the FBI report, the center’s analysis considered only mass shootings committed by concealed carry permit holders. A third tally of mass shootings,  published Dec. 15, 2012 by the left-leaning Mother Jones magazine, found there had been 62 mass shootings over 30 years, with not a single case in which the killing was stopped by a civilian with a gun. The Mother Jones investigation used the more restrictive ""mass murder definition""-- four or more killed at once  in its count of shootings. Meantime, the  Wonkblog post that cited the center’s shooting count reached its own -- higher -- tally of eight instances that someone with a concealed-carry license intervened in a mass shooting situation. That count was attributed to an Oct. 3, 2015, Washington Post blog post, by UCLA law professor Eugene Volokh; two more incidents were added later to his list. In his post, Volokh acknowledged that the effect of more widespread gun possession on the outcome of mass shootings remains unknown. Of his examples, he conceded ""at least some examples are ambiguous, because it might be unclear… whether the shooter had been planning to kill more people when he was stopped."" By either FBI definition, the death toll only climbed high enough to count as a mass shooting in one of the 10 incidents identified by Volokh. In all the others, it is unsure whether the shooter would have continued shooting had he not been shot himself, making it difficult to do an authoritative count of interventions. For instance, in a 2014 incident at Mercy Fitzgerald Hospital near Philadelphia, a psychiatric patient shot his caseworker in the face and wounded his psychiatrist before the psychiatrist shot him. He was then wrestled to the ground. The shooter, Richard S. Plott, had more than 30 additional rounds of ammunition on him when he was stopped. There are drawbacks to any attempt to compile and compare statistics from different sources; there’s also a good reason comprehensive data on gun violence is hard to come by. Since 1996, Congress has restricted research into gun violence with a budget that states: ""None of the funds made available for injury prevention and control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may be used to advocate or promote gun control."" The CDC read the restriction broadly and radically reduced research on gun violence as a result; Obama reversed the funding rule by executive order in 2013. Our Ruling When we looked, the Gun Free UT blog included this claim:  ""29 mass shootings have been committed by concealed carriers since 2007, while during this period only one (1) licensed civilian meaningfully intervened in a mass shooting."" The first Gun Free UT claim is accurate in that in that 29 mass shootings, according to a definition provided by the FBI, were carried out by people with concealed weapons. An attempt by Bearing Arms to refute the claim calls the incidents mass killings, but uses the FBI definition for mass murder. The claims leaves out information that could clarify the tangle of definitions used.  By Gun Free UT's own admission, the website claim lacks context. The second claim that only one licensed civilian intervened in a mass shooting is false by the FBI definition of a mass shooting, but bolsters Gun Free UT’s cause because no armed civilian has intervened in a mass shooting",Half True,"November 23, 2015"
"""Forty-five states allow open carry of firearms.""","The former president of the National Rifle Association is defending bills in the Florida Legislature proposing the open carry of handguns, saying the vast majority of states already allow the practice. Marion Hammer, currently executive director of United Sportsmen of Florida, responded to criticism of SB 300 and its companion in the House, HB 163. In a column posted on the NRA’s Institute for Legislative Action website on Nov. 1, 2015, Hammer pointed out how many states allow open carry. ""Forty-five (45) states allow open carry of firearms,"" she wrote. ""Varying restrictions on open carry in some states does not alter the fact that 45 states allow open carry."" Hammer was refuting Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri, who is the Florida Sheriffs Association Legislative Committee chairman. Gualtieri, whose group opposes the bills, previously told the Palm Beach Post it’s not really accurate to say those 45 states allow open carry because there are various rules and restrictions on the practice. PolitiFact Florida decided to get to the bottom of just how many states do let you carry guns openly in public. Laws across states The bills filed in the state Legislature would allow anyone with a valid concealed weapons permit to also carry their handgun openly, a practice currently prohibited by law. Obtaining a license for concealed carry already includes requirements for registration, fingerprinting and firearm training. Florida has about 1.4 million concealed weapon permit holders. Both bills are pending approval by committees before the 2016 legislative session. Hammer told PolitiFact Florida that her figure came from the NRA’s own research of state laws. According to that analysis, there are four other states that prohibit handgun open carry in public places like Florida — California, Illinois, New York and South Carolina. The District of Columbia does not allow it, either. Hammer is equating the lack of an outright ban in other states with the other 45 states allowing the practice, but it isn’t quite that cut and dried. There are different rules and restrictions in different places, and some so-called open carry states can be very specific about what’s required. The Florida bills address the open carry of handguns, so that's the context of Hammer's column. There are other states that allow the open carry of handguns while restricting long guns, such as rifles and shotguns. The Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence agrees with the NRA on the same five states that prohibit open carry. But the center points out that Massachusetts, Minnesota and New Jersey prohibit the open carry of long guns, just as Florida, California, Illinois and D.C. do. But New York and South Carolina allow open carry for long guns, while preventing it for handguns. So Hammer’s statement that 45 states allow the open carry of firearms, period, is imprecise. Further, 15 states require a permit or license to open carry, while eight more have other restrictions on how, when or where you are allowed to do so. Some municipalities restrict open carry in ways their state doesn’t. In Pennsylvania, open carry is generally allowed without a license, but Philadelphia does require a license. There are even more caveats about specific states and where they land on the open carry spectrum. For example, gun rights group OpenCarry.org doesn’t include Texas on its list of open carry states, because its recently passed law doesn’t take effect until Jan. 1, 2016. Like Florida’s proposed change, the state’s concealed carry license will become an open carry license for handguns as well. There are also states that could be categorized differently depending on how you interpret the local laws. The NRA’s Institute for Legislative Action noted Arkansas is hard to categorize. The state decriminalized the open or concealed carry of a loaded handgun in 2013, but the state’s ban was not repealed. Attorney General Leslie Rutledge said in a nonbinding opinion that the law was intended to protect people traveling through or across the state, even though open carry was still technically against the law. The Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence notes you generally can’t carry openly or concealed in Arkansas with the gun ""readily available for use with a purpose to employ (it) as a weapon against a person."" All the groups we consulted agreed California is not an open-carry state because it banned open carry of loaded handguns starting in 2012, but there’s still more to the story. If you live in a California county with less than 200,000 people, you can ask the local sheriff or police chief to give you an open-carry license at his or her discretion. Of course, the license is only good for that county, but there’s wiggle room in saying California prohibits open carry. Our ruling Hammer said, ""Forty-five states allow open carry of firearms."" Groups both for and against stricter gun laws told us there are five states that have laws banning open carry for handguns: California, Florida, Illinois, New York and South Carolina. It’s worth remembering, however, that the laws in some open-carry states are not as permissive as Hammer makes it seem. Several states have restrictions on the open carry of certain types of firearms, and in some places the rules are stricter than others",Mostly True,"November 18, 2015"
"""Since we last debated in Las Vegas, nearly 3,000 people have been killed by guns.""","At the Democratic presidential debate in Des Moines, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called for more gun control. ""Just think about this -- since we last debated in Las Vegas, nearly 3,000 people have been killed by guns,"" she said. The Iowa debate took place Nov. 14, and the Las Vegas debate happened on Oct. 13. Really? Were 3,000 people were killed by guns in just one month? We decided to check it out. When we reached out to the Clinton campaign for evidence, they directed us to the Centers for Disease Control. In 2013 -- the most recent CDC tally -- 33,636 people died in gun incidents. If you divide that by 12, it comes out to 2,803 -- or nearly 3,000 people a month. But Clinton was talking about 2015, not 2013. More recent data doesn’t seem to exist. We surveyed a number of experts, and they all said the CDC is the best source on this topic. A CDC spokesman told us that 2014 data will come out in December. The only alternative we could find is the Gun Violence Archive, which is a nonprofit organization that keeps a running tally of gun deaths by combing through police blotters and news media, among other sources, daily. The Gun Violence Archive’s numbers aren’t comprehensive, though. In 2014, the group counted 12,500 gun deaths in 2014 and 11,500 so far in 2015 -- both less than half of what the CDC counted in 2013. This is largely because the count doesn't include suicides, which make up more than half of all gun deaths.  The archive will receive 2015 suicide data in about six months, said Mark Bryant, the archive's executive director. He said that their total number of gun deaths could triple when that data is added in. So Clinton is wrong to suggest we can know how many people died from gun injuries since the Democrats debated in Las Vegas. Still, we wanted to know if it was possible Clinton’s claim is accurate for this year, so we ran her number by some experts. ""My call is that Clinton’s claim is not necessarily proven, but it is well in the range of possibility,"" said Jay Corzine, a sociology professor who studies violent crime at the University of Central Florida. In fact, the total for 2015 might be higher than 2013, as gun suicides are up, said Garen Wintemute, an expert in gun violence at the University of California Davis. Homicides are up, too, which would contribute to a higher number of gun deaths this year, Corzine noted. One final note on Clinton’s phrasing: Some could interpret her description of gun deaths -- ""killed by guns"" -- as violence inflicted upon one person by another. However, more than 60 percent of all gun deaths in 2013 were intentional suicides, according to the CDC. Our ruling Clinton said, ""Since we last debated in Las Vegas, nearly 3,000 people have been killed by guns."" We found a few problems with her statement. First, we don’t actually know how many people have died in the last month. Clinton’s statement is based on 2013 data from the CDC, which tallied nearly 3,000 gun deaths per month that year. There’s not more recent data available. Experts say the number of gun deaths this year is likely to be similar to or higher than 2013, so Clinton’s claim is probably not too far off. But we can’t know for sure. Also, it’s likely that at roughly half of these deaths are due to suicide. It could be even higher. Clinton’s phrasing obscures that point. Clinton used very specific language even though she’s actually extrapolating from old data",Half True,"November 17, 2015"
"""After Sandy Hook, Ted Cruz stopped Obama’s push for new gun control laws.""","A group supporting Ted Cruz for president took a jab at another big-state Cuban American hopeful in a video ad that debuted before the Nov. 10, 2015, Republican presidential debate in Milwaukee. The 60-second spot from the Courageous Conservatives PAC suggests that unlike Cruz, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida doesn’t have a record to celebrate. The group is a super PAC, meaning it may raise and spend unlimited amounts of money from sources including corporations and unions to campaign independently for candidates for federal office. We noticed this pro-Cruz claim in its ad: ""After Sandy Hook, Ted Cruz stopped Obama’s push for new gun control laws."" The ad’s reference to the Dec. 14, 2012, shootings at a Connecticut school drew a rebuke from Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., who said the ad made him want to throw up, according to a news story in the Hartford Courant. Murphy said: ""If Ted Cruz wants to brandish his pro-gun credentials to Republican primary voters, that's his right. But it's sick that he thinks he'll win votes by specifically pointing out that in the wake of 20 dead first-graders, he was the face of the fight to ensure no action was taken."" To be fair, Cruz doesn’t control the Courageous Conservatives PAC; that would be a legal no-no. Still, did Cruz stop Obama’s gun-control plans, as the group says? That seemed unlikely in that the Texan was only elected to the Senate a few weeks before a man entered Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., and killed 20 children and six adults, prompting calls for stiffer gun laws from President Barack Obama and others. We asked a PAC contact for its backup information. In a Facebook message, consultant Rick Shaftan said the ad was based on Cruz's comments in an Oct. 29, 2015, interview with Bret Baier, chief political anchor for Fox News. Cruz told Baier: ""Over two years ago, following the tragic shootings in Newtown, Conn., the Democrats came out with a massive raft of new gun control proposals. I led the opposition against it. … We defeated every one of those proposals on the floor of the Senate, defending the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms."" Cruz opposed gun-control proposals To get a fix on Cruz’s role in the 2013 debate, we checked news accounts and the Congressional Record, which recaps each speech and floor vote. On Jan. 3, 2013, the day he was sworn in, Cruz hammered his opposition to gun-control proposals, saying the tragic school shootings didn’t justify efforts to curb Second Amendment rights. ""I think every parent who saw what happened in Newtown was understandably horrified,"" Cruz told reporters, but ""I also think, predictably and sadly, within minutes of that horrific crime we saw politicians out trying to exploit that tragedy and to push their gun control agenda."" About a week later, Cruz responded to Vice President Joe Biden’s vow that Obama would use executive action where he could to help stop gun violence. Cruz said on Facebook: ""Let us hope that this is just another one of the vice president's infamous gaffes and not another end-run of Congress and the constitutional balance of powers through unilateral action by the president. I stand ready to defend the Second Amendment and efforts to undermine our God-given rights."" Cruz subsequently stuck to his guns. At a Jan. 30, 2013, hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee, for instance, the former solicitor general of Texas urged members to ""be vigorous and unrelenting in working to prevent, to deter and to punish violent criminals. I have spent a substantial portion of my professional life working in law enforcement. And the tragedies that are inflicted on innocent Americans every day by criminals are heartbreaking, and we need to do more to prevent them. ""At the same time,"" Cruz said, ""I think we should remain vigilant in protecting the constitutional rights of law-abiding citizens. And I think far too often, the approaches that have been suggested by this Congress to the issue of gun violence restricts the liberties of law-abiding citizens rather than targeting the violent criminals that we should be targeting."" On April 11, 2013, Cruz was on the losing end of a 68-31 Senate vote to let the body — which then had a Democratic majority — move toward considering a proposal to ""ensure that all individuals who should be prohibited from buying a firearm are listed in the national  instant criminal background check system and require a background check for every firearm sale."" Some 16 Republicans joined Democrats in agreeing to proceed. Six days later, though, the Senate blocked or defeated every major gun-control proposal championed by Obama, The Washington Post reported. A CNN news report said ""fierce opposition by the powerful National Rifle Association led a backlash by conservative Republicans and a few Democrats from pro-gun states that doomed key proposals in the gun package, even after they had been watered down to try to satisfy opponents."" The failed proposals included attempts to ban certain military-style assault rifles and limit the size of ammunition magazines, the Post story said. ""But the biggest setback for the White House was the defeat of a measure to expand background checks to most gun sales,"" designed to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill, the story said. The described proposal, presented by Sens. Joe  Manchin, D-W.Va., and Patrick Toomey, R-Penn., would have expanded criminal background checks to gun shows and Internet sales, but did not require them of family members and friends giving or selling guns to each other. It was seen as a compromise, replacing stricter language from Majority Leader Harry Reid’s Safe Communities, Safe Schools Act of 2013. Senators voted 54-46 to proceed, but that margin still left supporters short of the 60 votes needed to ward off a filibuster. It wasn’t an entirely partisan split; several Republicans voted to proceed, several Democrats voted ""no."" In other votes that day, the Post said, 40 senators supported a renewal of a federal assault-weapons ban and 46 supported limiting the size of ammunition magazines. In addition, an NRA-backed measure that clarified gun-trafficking laws fell short, with just 58 votes, stunning Democrats, the newspaper said. Afterward, Obama blamed the NRA for stoking unreasonable fears. He also laid the blame on Republicans, the Post reported. ""Ninety percent of Democrats in the Senate voted for that idea, but it’s not going to happen because 90 percent of Republicans just voted against it,"" Obama said. Opponents maintained the Manchin-Toomey background check proposal eventually would have led to a national gun registry, though the proposal outlawed a federal registry. The opponents also said it would do little to prevent mass shootings while creating an imposition for law-abiding citizens, especially those in rural areas. The Post story quoted Cruz telling colleagues: ""My biggest concern with the legislation, the Democrat legislation on the floor, is it doesn’t address the problem. It doesn’t target violent criminals. Instead, what it does is, it targets law-abiding citizens."" An alternate approach Cruz was among the critical 46 ""no"" votes. He also separately joined Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, in authoring a substitute proposal, reportedly supported by the NRA. At the substitute’s unveiling, according to a news story in The Hill, a Washington, D.C., newspaper, Cruz said that while the Obama administration was continuing to ""politicize a terrible tragedy to push its anti-gun agenda, I am proud to stand beside my fellow senators to present common-sense measures."" The Grassley-Cruz alternative did not impose background checks on transactions at gun shows or on sales over the Internet. But it would have provided incentives for states to submit relevant mental health records to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System and required federal courts to do so. It also would have allocated money for prosecuting violations of the background check requirement. In the Senate, the Grassley-Cruz proposal was favored 52-46, hence stalling out due to the 60-vote hurdle. Our ruling The pro-Cruz PAC said that after the Sandy Hook shootings, ""Cruz stopped Obama’s push for new gun control laws."" Actually, Cruz had company in stopping the Obama-supported push for new restrictions. Crucially, most Senate Republicans and a few Democrats kept the expansion of background checks favored by Obama from winning further consideration. Still, we see an element of truth here. Despite just joining the Senate, Cruz frequently spoke out on the issue and shared authorship of an unsuccessful alternative to the failed background-check plan",Mostly False,"November 13, 2015"
"""Texas #2 in nation for new gun purchases, behind California.""","Greg Abbott is embarrassed? So the Texas governor said in this October 2015 tweet: ""I'm EMBARRASSED: Texas #2 in nation for new gun purchases, behind CALIFORNIA. Let's pick up the pace Texans."" Can’t be right. Right? It wasn’t. Abbott’s tweet linked to a news blog post in which the Houston Chronicle reported that while the number of requests to buy firearms in Texas had topped 1 million for the year, the Lone Star State still trailed California in such requests, according to the FBI. The post drew on FBI counts, all right, but the agency doesn’t track the number of firearms purchased in each state. When we asked spokesman Stephen Fischer about such detail, he emailed us a link to the agency web page tallying requests made by firearms dealers through the National Instant Criminal Background Check system known as NICS to determine whether a person should be disqualified from buying a gun based on a range of matters, such as prior criminal history to mental health. A footnote to the chart says: ""These statistics represent the number of firearm background checks initiated through the NICS. They do not represent the number of firearms sold. Based on varying state laws and purchase scenarios, a one-to-one correlation cannot be made between a firearm background check and a firearm sale."" That’s a big caveat. Background checks in 2015 Still, let’s see how the requests for instant background checks have been stacking up. From January through October 2015, the most background checks were submitted from Kentucky — 2.6 million such requests. California was next, with 1.3 million, and then Texas, with nearly 1.2 million checks. Adjusting for population We recognized another way to evaluate how each of the 10 states with the most requests for background checks stack up: Adjust for population. Drawing on U.S. census estimates of each state’s population as of July 2014, we found that Kentucky led nationally through the first 10 months of 2015 by generating nearly 0.6 requests for background checks per resident. States lagging far behind included Alabama and Indiana (0.1 requests per resident); Tennessee, Illinois, Pennsylvania and Ohio (less than 0.1 requests per resident) and Texas and Florida (0.04 requests per resident). We found California ranking last in this subgroup (0.03 requests per resident). Guns purchased without background checks A wrinkle: Any estimate of gun purchases by state is hindered by the unknown number of private purchases or gifts of guns not preceded by background checks. A 1997 study occasionally is invoked to suggest 40 percent of gun sales don’t involve background checks. That’s not a correct reading of the study, PolitiFact has noted. Also, one of the researchers has since said it’s not known how many purchases occur without background checks. We asked Abbott’s office about his claim and didn’t hear back. Our ruling Abbott said: ""Texas #2 in nation for new gun purchases, behind CALIFORNIA."" Hold fire: The FBI counsels against using requests for instant background checks to estimate gun purchases, which was Abbott’s basis for his statement. Besides that, Texas ranked third behind Kentucky and California in the number of checks requested for gun purchases through the first 10 months of 2015. Adjust for population and among the 10 states with the most requested background checks, Texas tied with Florida for 8th place with both states and seven others accounting for more per-capita requests for background checks than California",False,"November 6, 2015"
"""It has been estimated that nearly 40 percent of all guns sold in America are sold by private, unlicensed sellers either online or through gun shows.""","Gov. Terry McAuliffe recently issued an executive order that banned firearms from most state buildings and offered his rationale for a gun control measure he plans to present to the General Assembly this winter. McAuliffe, a Democrat, is calling for a law that would require all prospective gun buyers in Virginia to undergo a background check to determine whether the purchaser has a disqualifying criminal record or mental health history. Although the governor long has supported this action, his intensity grew after the Aug. 26 fatal shootings of Roanoke television reporter Alison Parker and cameraman Adam Ward near Smith Mountain Lake. Virginia law now requires all licensed gun dealers - those in the business of selling arms - to conduct computerized checks on buyers. But sales between individuals are exempt and that, McAuliffe says, opens a loophole for guns to fall into the wrong hands. A federal law requiring background checks has the same exemption. ""It has been estimated that nearly 40 percent of all guns sold in America are sold by private, unlicensed sellers either online or through guns shows,"" McAuliffe stated in his Oct. 15 executive order.   Christina Nuckols, deputy press secretary for McAuliffe, said the source of the 40 percent figure is a 1997 study by the National Institute of Justice that looked at gun owners’ responses to a 1994 national survey asking how they got their weapons. The study found that 30 percent to 40 percent of all gun transactions were made through an ""off-the-books"" transfer in which a background check wasn’t required. The finding has been cited widely by gun control advocates - including Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D- Va. - in calling for a federal law mandating universal background checks. But as we and other fact checkers have noted previously, the research is old and limited. Consider: McAuliffe’s statement misses a key distinction in the study: The research looked at all gun transactions - including when a gun was obtained as a gift or as an inheritance - and not just being ""sold,"" as the governor said. The Fact Checker at The Washington Post in 2013 asked one of the co-authors of the study, Jens Ludwig of the University of Chicago, to crunch the 1994 data just looking at sales. Ludwig replied that 14 percent to 22 percent of guns were purchased without a background check. The 1994 data, we also should note, did not have a category for online sales, as McAuliffe’s statement suggests. Earlier this year, we asked the other co-author of the report, Philip Cook of Duke University, what percentage of guns currently are sold without a background check. In response, he sent us an op-ed that he and Ludwig wrote in the National Review after the December 2012 shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. - a time when the 40 percent figure was circulating again.   ""We’ve been following the give-and-take with some interest because our research is the original source of the 40-percent statistic,"" they wrote. ""Our views may come as a surprise: First, we don’t know the current percentage - nor does anyone else."" The lack of current data is due largely because federal funding for gun studies dried up two decades ago. President Barack Obama issued a memorandum in 2013 directing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to re-examine gun violence. We also should note that Virginia doesn’t keep data about private guns, said Corinne Geller, communications manager for the state police. As a result, we recently gave a False rating to a statement by state Sen. Tommy Norment, R-James City, that only 2 percent of Virginia gun sales are exempt from background checks. The fact is, nobody knows. Our ruling McAuliffe said, ""It has been estimated that nearly 40 percent of all guns sold in America are sold by private, unlicensed sellers either online or through gun shows."" His source is a small-sample survey from 1994 that included firearms that were sold and those that were given as gifts or inheritances. When the results were adjusted to guns sold - the term McAuliffe uses - only 14 percent to 22 percent of the firearms were sold without background checks. The researchers say they ""don’t know"" if their findings are relevant today. No current national study has been published. McAuliffe did not acknowledge these points, all of which have been reported widely",Mostly False,"November 2, 2015"
"""There have been more than 300 mass shootings in the United States this year – more than any other country in the world.""","On the floor of the U.S. House, Rep. David Cicilline reached for a statistic to bolster his argument for stronger background checks on gun buyers. ""There have been more than 300 mass shootings in the United States this year – more than any other country in the world,"" the Rhode Island Democrat said. It’s clear the United States has a problem with rampage shootings carried out in schools and workplaces. But more mass shootings than anywhere else in the world? Had Cicilline considered any of the world’s war zones? Richard Luchette, the Cicilline staffer who had sent us a YouTube video of the congressman’s remarks, provided two sources that Cicilline used in his speech: a website called Mass Shooting Tracker and a recent Wall Street Journal article with the headline ""U.S. Leads World in Mass Shootings."" Mass Shooting Tracker, a crowd-sourced data website that compiles media reports, has documented more than 300 incidents in the U.S. this year in which four or more people were shot. The total number of incidents meeting the site’s definition of a ""mass shooting"" could be greater than what’s reported on the site. The tracker has its issues. For one, its definition of a ""mass shooting"" does not require anyone to be killed. For another, some shootings may not make it into the news media. ""Mass shooting"" is not the term that the Congressional Research Service developed for its widely circulated report on the types of shootings taking place in schools and workplaces.   The congressional report focuses on shootings in a ""relatively public"" location in which either a gunman or gunmen select victims ""somewhat indiscriminately"" and kill, four or more people. The report calls such shootings ""public mass shootings."" Also, on Oct. 8, PolitiFact Florida gave U.S. Rep Debbie Wasserman Schultz a ruling of half true for a statement about mass shootings that PolitiFact said relied too heavily on the tracker site data.   But the Mass Shooting Tracker has documented more than 300 shootings with at least four people wounded and Cicilline quoted its findings accurately. The second half of the congressman’s claim is more problematic, in large part, because it has little in common with the first half of the claim. The Wall Street Journal article cited by Luchette refers to research assembled by Adam Lankford, an associate professor of at the University of Alabama Department of Criminal Justice. Lankford examined ""public mass shootings"" in the United States and around the world from 1966 to 2012. He did not consider mass shootings in war zones or mass shootings motivated by gang rivalries.  He identified a total of 292 shooters whose violence met his specific criteria for a public mass shooting, including at least four deaths. He determined that 90 of these shooters, 31 percent of the world’s total, had carried out their attacks in the United States. And that this was more than in any other country. ""Any politician who says that is correct, according to my research of these types of crimes,"" Lankford says.  Our ruling In the YouTube video that Cicilline’s staff sent us, the congressman said: ""There have been more than 300 mass shootings in the United States this year – more than any other country in the world.""  The problem with that sentence is that he mixes disparate facts to draw a single conclusion. The ""mass shootings"" of the first part are not the same as the ""public mass shootings"" of the second part. And so while both parts are basically correct, Cicilline was off base when he put them together. The Mass Shooting Tracker does not tally foreign shootings. And the social scientist from the University of Alabama looked at different events from a different period of time. The first half of his sentence is true and the second half is true. But two trues, in this case, don’t make the whole truth",Half True,"November 1, 2015"
"""German citizens were disarmed by their government in the late 1930s,"" which allowed the Nazis to ""carry out their evil intentions with relatively little resistance.""","Republican Ben Carson has been criticized for suggesting that gun control enabled the rise of the Nazis and led to the extermination of 6 million Jews during the Holocaust. But does he have a point? In his book, A More Perfect Union, Carson wrote that ""German citizens were disarmed by their government in the late 1930s, and by the mid-1940s Hitler's regime had mercilessly slaughtered six million Jews and numerous others whom they considered inferior. ""Through a combination of removing guns and disseminating deceitful propaganda, the Nazis were able to carry out their evil intentions with relatively little resistance,"" he wrote. Carson reiterated that argument at least twice -- in an Oct. 8, 2015, interview with CNN host Wolf Blitzer, and then again in a speech at the National Press Club. ""You know, mid- to late-30s, they started a program to disarm the people and by mid- to late 40's, look what had happened,"" he said at the Press Club. PolitiFact decided to analyze Carson’s claim on its Truth-O-Meter. German gun laws As the Nazi Party rose to power in Germany, it inherited a 1928 gun registration law that had replaced a total ban on gun ownership imposed on a defeated Germany after World War I. The 1928 law created a permit system to own and sell firearms and ammunition. ""But this order was followed quite rarely, so that largely, only newly bought weapons became registered,"" said Dagmar Ellerbrock, an expert on German gun policies at the Dresden Technical University. ""At that time, most men, and many women, still owned the weapons they acquired before or during the first World War."" When they came to power, the Nazis used whatever gun records they had to seize weapons from their enemies, but Ellerbock told us the files included very few of the firearms in circulation. ""In my records, I found many Jews who well into the late 1930s possessed guns,"" Ellerbock told us. The Nazis adopted a new gun law in 1938. According to an analysis by Bernard Harcourt, a professor at Columbia University School of Law, it loosened gun ownership rules in several ways. It deregulated the buying and selling of rifles, shotguns and ammunition. It made handguns easier to own by allowing anyone with a hunting license to buy, sell or carry one at any time. (You didn’t need to be hunting.) It also extended the permit period from one year to three and gave local officials more discretion in letting people under 18 get a gun. The regulations to implement this law, rather than the law itself, did impose new limits on one group: Jews. On Nov. 11, 1938, the German minister of the interior issued ""Regulations Against Jews Possession of Weapons."" Not only were Jews forbidden to own guns and ammunition, they couldn’t own ""truncheons or stabbing weapons."" In addition to the restrictions, Ellerbrock said the Nazis had already been raiding Jewish homes and seizing weapons. ""The gun policy of the Nazis can hardly be compared to the democratic procedures of gun regulations by law,"" Ellerbrock told us. ""It was a kind of special administrative practice (Sonderrecht), which treated people in different ways according to their political opinion or according to ‘racial identity’ in Nazi terms."" The power of a police state In short, Nazi-era Germany imposed greater gun restrictions for Jews (and other perceived enemies) at the same time it loosened gun restrictions for other groups. But that’s not what Carson said. He made a more sweeping claim about Nazis disarming German citizens. Carson then goes on to say that the lack of guns allowed the Nazis to ""carry out their evil intentions with relatively little resistance."" But a key turning point in the Nazi path to power illustrates that the availability of guns was not a pivotal issue. Paramilitary organizations were part of the Nazi operation from its earliest days in the mid 1920s. The Sturmabteilung, or Brownshirts, was a founding Nazi street fighting organization. Another outfit, the Schutzstaffel, or SS, provided protection to Nazi officials as they moved about the country. After Hitler won office, the SS under Heinrich Himmler became part of Hitler's inner circle, and Himmler felt the Sturmabteilung was too difficult to control. He and his collaborators concocted a rumor that the Sturmabteilung was plotting a coup. In 1934, in a span of three days, Himmler’s SS units killed between 85 and 200 Sturmabteilung leaders and other perceived enemies. Hitler himself oversaw the arrest of one of his oldest comrades, Ernst Roehm, the head of the Sturmabteilung. In the middle of that arrest, a truckload of armed Sturmabteilung troops rolled up, but not a shot was fired. Roehm was executed days later. The staff at the German Historical Institute wrote that with this operation, Hitler had managed to ""legitimize outright murder on a large scale – without any legal proceedings whatsoever – and that the country largely accepted the Nazi propaganda that presented this strike as necessary."" Our ruling Carson said that under the Nazis, ""German citizens were disarmed by their government in the late 1930s,"" which allowed the Nazis to ""carry out their evil intentions with relatively little resistance."" This is a misreading of history on two levels. First, German citizens as a whole were not disarmed by the Nazis. Jews and other supposed enemies of the state were subject to having their weapons seized. But for most German citizens, the Nazi period was one in which gun regulations were loosened, not tightened.  Second, a lack of guns was not the issue. If the majority of Germans had wanted to use these guns to fight the Nazis, they could have. But they didn’t. Carson ignores that the Nazis enjoyed significant popular support, or at least, broad acquiescence",False,"October 26, 2015"
"Says ""only about 2 percent"" of gun sales in Virginia are not subject to background checks.","Efforts to widen Virginia’s background checks on people seeking to buy firearms underwhelm state Senate Majority Leader Tommy Norment, R-James City. ""We have a pretty comprehensive background check right now,"" Norment said during a recent debate with Senate Minority Leader Dick Saslaw, D-Fairfax. ""Right now, statistics in the commonwealth of Virginia show that only about 2 percent of the guns that are being bought or sold are outside of that universal background check,"" Norment added. Gov. Terry McAuliffe wants a reluctant General Assembly to expand Virginia’s background check to all prospective gun buyers. His call came in the wake of the Aug. 26 fatal shootings near Smith Mountain Lake of WDBJ-TV reporter Alison Parker and cameraman Adam Ward. The law now requires all licensed gun dealers - those in the business of selling arms - to conduct a computerized check to determine whether a buyer has a disqualifying criminal record or mental health history. But casual sales and transfers between individuals are exempt. We wondered whether Norment was right in saying only 2 percent of Virginia sales fall into that exempt category. Jeff Ryer, a spokesman for the Virginia Senate Republican Caucus, told us Norment erred. ""As best we can determine, there are no state-by-state statistics available for the source of a firearm used in a crime,"" Ryer wrote in an email. Ryer is correct. Neither the Virginia State Police nor the Virginia Firearms Transaction Center ""has any way of tracking the volume of private sales in Virginia,"" said Corinne Geller, communications manager for the state police. We also should note that there are no conclusive national statistics about the percentage of guns that are sold without a background check. Many gun control advocates - including McAuliffe and U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va. - have said it’s ""estimated"" that 40 percent of U.S. gun sales occur without background checks. But this claim is based on a small-sample survey of purchasers that’s almost 21 years old and counts some guns that were brought before a national background check law took effect. As we’ve reported, even the researchers of that study say they ""don’t know"" if their findings are relevant today. There’s been no updated national study. A final note: The killer of Parker and Ward bought his gun legally and passed a background check, according to law-enforcement officials. Our ruling Norment said ""only about 2 percent"" of gun sales in Virginia are not subject to background checks. A spokesman says Norment erred, and we agree.

"""We lose an average of 90 Americans every day because of guns.""","Rallying supporters in San Antonio, Hillary Clinton said Oct. 15, 2015, that she’s running for president in part ""to protect our families and communities from the plague of gun violence."" Clinton, who was introduced and endorsed by Julián Castro, the former San Antonio mayor serving as secretary of Housing and Urban Development, went on: ""Look, you know, we lose an average of 90 Americans every day because of guns."" Is that so? Earlier in the week, the former first lady, senator and secretary of state aired the same per-day count at the Democratic presidential debate hosted by CNN. On her campaign website, Clinton says she favors more pre-purchase background checks, ""cracking down on illegal gun traffickers, holding dealers and manufacturers accountable when they endanger Americans, and keeping guns out of the hands of domestic abusers and stalkers."" A subsequent check of Clinton’s 90 gun deaths by FactCheck.org, based at the University of Pennsylvania, found that while Clinton’s figure held up for 2013, the last year of available data, it is worth noting that only one-third of firearm deaths consisted of homicides; most other gun deaths counted as suicides. At least once, Clinton has clarified her figure by mentioning suicides; according to an Oct. 7, 2015, post on her campaign website, she said in Muscatine, Iowa: ""We lose between 88 and 92 Americans a day from gun violence — homicides, suicides and accidents — and we have to act."" Let’s go to the numbers. Federal statistics According to the most recent figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 33,636 U.S. firearm deaths were recorded in 2013 — or 92 a day, on average. Some 63 percent of that year’s firearm deaths, or 21,175, were suicides, with 11,208 considered homicides and the rest classified as unintentional discharges (505), legal intervention/war (467) and undetermined (281). We confirmed those figures and checked the numbers for the four previous years (2009-12), finding a five-year average of 89 firearm deaths a day. In that period, the low was 86 firearm deaths a day in 2009 while the 2012 and 2013 averages tied at 92. For each year too, suicides by firearm accounted for far more deaths than homicides by firearm. Government statistician Next, we reached out to the CDC. By email, statistician Ken Kochanek said the 2013 figures remain the latest available. To our request, Kochanek drew on the agency’s statistics to create a document showing that the rate of U.S. deaths by firearm in 2013, roughly 10.6 per 100,000 residents, exceeded the rate of 10.4 per 100,0000 residents for 1999 through 2013. The 15-year high was set in 2012 — 10.7 per 100,000 residents. The 15-year low was set in 2004 — 10.1 firearm deaths per 100,000 residents. Asked to focus on homicides by firearm, Kochanek emailed a document indicating the 2013 rate of 3.5 homicides by firearm per 100,000 residents was less than the 3.9 homicides by firearm per 100,000 residents over the 15-year period. Over those years, the highest rate, of 4.3 homicides by firearm per 100,000 residents, was set in 2006 and the lowest rate, 3.6 homicides by firearm per 100,000 residents was set in two years, 2010 and 2011. Our ruling Clinton said: ""We lose an average of 90 Americans every day because of guns."" That’s about right. But it leaves unsaid that the bulk of those deaths are suicides, not homicides. Also, in 2013, the latest year of available data, the rate of homicides by firearm was lower than the rate for 1999 through 2013",Mostly True,"October 21, 2015"
"The gun industry is ""the only business in America that is wholly protected from any kind of liability.""","At the first Democratic debate of the 2016 presidential race, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton criticized opponent Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., for supporting a 2005 law that shields the gun industry from certain lawsuits. Clinton voted against this law when she was a senator, and she has lambasted it several times on the campaign trail this month. ""Probably one of the most egregious, wrong, pieces of legislation that ever passed the Congress when it comes to this issue is to protect gun sellers and gun makers from liability,"" she said in Iowa Oct. 7. ""They are the only business in America that is wholly protected from any kind of liability. They can sell a gun to someone they know they shouldn't, and they won't be sued. There will be no consequences."" Is Clinton right? Are gun makers and dealers ""wholly protected"" against any kind of lawsuit, and do no other industries have similar immunities? Short answer: No. The gun industry is susceptible to some lawsuits, and there are federal laws restricting liability for a number of other types of businesses. As support, Clinton’s staff sent us a public health journal article that argues the gun industry’s ""broad immunity"" against litigation inhibits safe manufacturing and distribution of firearms, though it does not directly address her claim. Exceptions The law at issue is the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, which was signed into law by President George W. Bush and seen as a victory for gun rights advocates. The purpose of the law is to protect gun dealers and manufacturers from lawsuits when their products are misused. For example, if a person buys a gun legally and then uses the gun to intentionally kill someone, the gun dealer and manufacturer cannot be held liable for the crime under the law. While opponents argue that the law stops some victims from having their day in court, supporters say the law protects gun dealers and manufacturers from frivolous and expensive legal proceedings. In any case, Clinton goes too far in saying the gun industry is ""wholly protected from any kind of liability."" The law lists several situations that are not protected from liability. It does not protect gun dealers who transfer a gun knowing it would be used for criminal purposes, nor those who knowingly break state or federal law if the violation results in harm. Gun manufacturers can also be sued if the gun, when used properly, causes injury because the product is defective. ""The statement is incorrect insofar as it suggests that gun makers are totally free from liability,"" said Adam Winkler, a law professor at the University of California Los Angeles who specializes in gun law. Some opponents of the law argue that the liability protection is so broad and ambiguous, and the exceptions so narrow, that some legitimate lawsuits won’t have a chance to appear in court. But this is different from saying the gun industry is wholly immune to all lawsuits. Clinton also said the gun industry is the ""only"" business in America with this total liability protection. We know that it doesn’t have total protection, but do other sectors have something similar? Not the only one The act ""is not the first federal law to grant a particular industry immunity from tort liability,"" said Timothy Lytton, a law professor at Georgia State University, who edited a book on gun industry litigation. Possibly the most analogous rule -- in that it protects a specific group of potential defendants from a specific liability theory -- is one that offers some immunity to online service providers, said John Goldberg, a law professor at Harvard University and an expert in tort law, in an email to PolitiFact. Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act blocks victims of online defamation from suing service providers (like Comcast) and content providers (like YouTube) for failing to monitor or remove defamatory posts uploaded by customers. In a prior interview with NPR, Goldberg called the gun industry law particularly ""aggressive"" in terms of the liability protections granted. Most of the experts we surveyed also mentioned a vaccine manufacturer liability law passed in the 1980s. Under the law, victims of injuries that they say were caused by defective vaccines are not allowed to sue vaccine manufacturers. This differs from the gun legislation, however, because it established the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, through which alleged victims can make a claim and receive compensation. ""By contrast, (the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act) simply prohibits certain kinds of tort claims against the gun industry without providing plaintiffs any alternative means of pursuing their claims,"" Lytton said. There’s also some liability protection in the medical devices and airline industries, noted Walter Olson, senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute and expert in tort law. For example,the 1994 General Aviation Revitalization Act said small aircraft manufacturers cannot be sued for accidents involving aircraft more than 18 years old. ""It’s not at all unique to the gun industry. It’s a version (of liability law) Congress developed for an industry that was under very heavy attack,"" Olson said, referring to the slew of litigation against gun sellers and makers that prompted Congress to pass the law. Our ruling Clinton said the gun industry is ""the only business in America that is wholly protected from any kind of liability."" Clinton is talking about a law that says the gun industry is protected from liability in certain instances, but the law also specifies several situations in which the gun industry is susceptible to lawsuits. Further, Congress has passed a number of laws that protect a variety of business sectors from lawsuits in certain situations, so the situation is not unique to the gun industry",False,"October 16, 2015"
"""Sen. Sanders did vote five times against the Brady bill.""","Hillary Clinton used the gun debate to try and attack Sen. Bernie Sanders from the left at the first Democratic debate. Sanders’ record on the issue has been the subject of much liberal ire. After CNN moderator Anderson Cooper grilled Sanders on his vote shielding firearms companies from lawsuits, Clinton brought up another time Sanders didn’t side with gun control advocates. ""The majority of our country supports background, and even the majority of gun owners do,"" Clinton said on Oct. 13. ""Sen. Sanders did vote five times against the Brady Bill."" Clinton is correct that most Americans (90 percent) support background checks. But did Sanders vote against the landmark Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, which mandated a five-day waiting period for background checks for gun purchases? Five nays from the Vermont congressman The Clinton campaign pointed to our July fact-check of an attack ad paid for by a pro-Martin O’Malley super PAC. We rated a slightly more expansive claim — ""Bernie Sanders voted against the Brady Bill, background checks and waiting periods"" — Mostly True. (That statement that referred specifically to background checks, which Sanders had supported.) Before it became law in 1993, the Brady bill underwent many transformations. Sanders, then Vermont’s sole representative in the U.S. House of Representatives, voted against the bill in its entirety five times: 1. In May 1991, Sanders voted against a version that mandated a seven-day waiting period for background checks, but the bill passed in the House.   2. The Senate decreased the waiting period to five days and the bill returned to the House. In November 1991, Sanders voted against that version. Though it passed in the House, the Senate didn’t muster enough votes. The Brady bill and its gun control stance remained in limbo during 1992. 3. After some back and forth, a version of the bill resurfaced that reinstated the five-day waiting period. In November 1993, Sanders voted against that version twice in the same day, but for an amendment imposing an instant background check instead (seen by some as pointless, as the technology for instant checks didn’t exist at the time). 4. He also voted against an amendment that would have ended state waiting periods, and for an amendment giving those denied a gun the right to know why. 5. The final compromise version of the Brady bill --  an interim five-day waiting period while installing an instant background check system -- was passed and signed into law on Nov. 30, 1993. Sanders voted against it. In July, when we first looked into the issue, Sanders’ campaign manager Jeff Weaver told us that Sanders voted against the bill because he believed a national waiting period was a federal overreach and because he was answering to his constituents. ""He wasn't opposed to states having (waiting periods) if they wanted to. The Republicans wanted to repeal waiting periods in states that had them, and Bernie voted that down,"" Weaver said. ""He said he would be against waiting periods, and he kept his word to the people of Vermont."" A mixed record overall Overall, Sanders is neither a gun nut nor an anti-gunner. He’s received lukewarm marks from the NRA, ranging from a C- to F in the last 15 years. ""Throughout his time in public office, Sen. Sanders has consistently voted to outlaw the most dangerous weapons and keep guns out of the hands of criminals,"" Sanders spokesperson Michael Briggs told us. Briggs noted that Sanders has voted in favor of banning assault weapons, closing the gun show loophole, regulating high capacity magazines, and expanding background checks in the wake of the Newtown massacre. On the flip side, Sanders has also voted to allow firearms on Amtrak trains and in National Parks, though his most recent pro-gun vote was in 2009. ""(Sanders’) gun control position is a reflection of living in Vermont for 40 years,"" Garrison Nelson, a professor of professor of political science at the University of Vermont, told us in July. ""Vermonters use guns to shoot deer and moose, not one another."" Our ruling Clinton said, ""Sen. Sanders did vote five times against the Brady bill."" Sanders voted against the Brady bill five times from 1991 to 1993. Sanders’ campaign manager told us in July that he did so because he was against a national waiting period and had to answer to the people of Vermont, a rural state with high gun ownership. Overall, Sanders has a mixed record when it comes to guns. But he did indeed register five nays on the Brady bill",True,"October 13, 2015"
"""In the states that allow open carry, violent crime was 23 percent lower.""","Florida is one of only a handful of states left in the country that doesn’t allow any open carry of firearms, and some state legislators want to change that. State Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fort Walton Beach, is sponsoring a bill that would allow those with a conceal carry license to openly carry their firearms. On Oct. 6, 2015, a House panel voted in favor of the bill, which will now advance to other committees in anticipation of a January legislative session. In a press conference before the hearing, Gaetz tried to allay fears that public safety would suffer by comparing crime rates in states without open carry with those that allow it. ""It is important to note that in the states that allow open carry, violent crime was 23 percent lower, the murder rate was 5 percent lower, the aggravated assault rate was 23 percent lower and robbery rates were 36 percent lower."" We decided to fact-check his claim that violent crime was 23 percent lower in open carry states. The statistic suggests that open carry laws make states safer, or at the very least don’t make them more dangerous. But the reality is much more complex, according to experts and research. Comparing states on violent crime rate Gaetz used Uniform Crime Reporting figures compiled by the U.S. Department of Justice to create his statistics. The data come 2012. He divided the states into two groups — the eight states that did not allow open carry at the time, which included Florida, Texas, California, South Carolina, Illinois, New York, Oklahoma, Arkansas — and the 42 states that did allow open carry. Gaetz then compared the total number of violent crimes (defined by federal officials as murder, forcible rape, robbery and aggravated assault) with the total population in the eight states without open carry in 2012. We checked his math and found the same result: Those states had a combined violent crime rate of about 434 per 100,000 people. The remaining 42 states had a violent crime rate of about 352 per 100,000. That means states with open carry laws did have a 23 percent lower violent crime rate that year. Not all open carry states are the same, however, and laws vary from state to state.  The Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence lists states that prohibit the open carry of handguns in public places, states that allow open carrying without a permit, and states that require some form of license to open carry. They currently list five states that prohibit the open carrying of handguns in public places. But that’s not the only issue with these statistics. We asked several experts about Gaetz’s methodology. Many of them said the single law was too narrow to draw meaningful conclusions about its impact. In essence, his number -- for one year -- is right, but so what? Gaetz framed the use of the stats as ""evidence that this bill does not create a less safe environment."" John Pierce, co-founder of gun rights group OpenCarry.org, agreed with that point. But he said the data doesn't necessarily reflect a correlation between allowing open carry and fewer instances of violent crime. He noted that Texas and Florida are both populous states with huge numbers of concealed carry permit holders so focusing just on open carry laws will give a skewed picture about the effect of legally-armed citizens on crime rates. Tomislav Kovandzic, a University of Texas professor who teaches classes on research methods and gun control, was more blunt. ""The problem with this approach is that it implicitly assumes that both groups of states were identical/similar before the laws in the treatment states (in this case, open carry states) were enacted,"" Kovandzic told PolitiFact via email. ""This is rarely, if ever, the case. As a result, the comparison merely reflects group differences that existed before the treatment states enacted the laws."" A sound look at the issue would require controlling for factors like specific crimes, population characteristics or other details, not Gaetz’s static group comparison. ""Even if he averaged multiple years together to make his open carry versus non-open carry comparison, it wouldn’t change the futility of the approach,"" he said. What does more detailed research have to say? Florida State University criminology professor Gary Kleck said that plenty of research has found rates of carry permit holding ""have no net effect on crime rates, including violent crime rates, one way or the other."" However, Kleck said that the research he has seen doesn’t differentiate between open carry and concealed carrying. Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, pointed us to a 2010 study that looked at whether right-to-carry laws affected crime rates. The conclusion: they didn’t. ""The best available evidence suggests that right to carry concealed laws are associated with increases in aggravated assaults with guns, but have no measurable effect on population rates of murder and robbery,"" Webster said. Our ruling Gaetz said, ""In the states that allow open carry, violent crime was 23 percent lower."" This is a fact that experts say is largely meaningless and shouldn’t weigh into any serious policy discussion. There may be less crime in those states, but there’s no way the single data point Gaetz gave can provide clues as to the effects of open carry laws. Gaetz’s statement is a one-year snapshot that is misleading",Half True,"October 9, 2015"
"""380 Americans have been killed in 294 mass shootings in 2015 alone.""","In the wake of the mass shooting at a community college in Oregon, Democratic National Committee chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz said that the ""national epidemic"" of such incidents demands a response from Congress. She directed some of her criticism at former Gov. Jeb Bush -- one of the Republican presidential candidates from her home state of Florida: ""A message for Jeb Bush: 380 Americans have been killed in 294 mass shootings in 2015 alone. ‘Stuff’ doesn't just ‘happen.’ Inaction happens,"" she said in an Oct. 2 tweet. (Here’s the background of what Bush said.) A reader asked PolitiFact to look at her statistical claim, because if you divide victims by shootings, then the numbers suggest that there are less than two deaths per ""mass"" shooting. We found that Wasserman Schultz used an overly broad definition of what most people would consider a mass shooting.  A look at the statistics Wasserman Schultz’s spokesman said she was citing a report in the Washington Post’s Wonkblog, which stated that the Oregon shooting brought the total of mass shootings this year to 294. The statistic came from Mass Shooting Tracker, a crowdsourced site, which defines mass shooting as any in which four or more people are shot, regardless of whether they die or are injured. But that definition is more broad than some other definitions, which we will get into later. Mass Shooting Tracker showed 294 mass shootings as of Oct. 1. About 122 of those incidents -- or about 42 percent -- involved zero fatalities. The shootings killed 379 people and injured 1,094. Brock Weller, a Portland, Ore., resident who launched the website in 2013, told PolitiFact he gets his information from news reports. Weller said he supports more gun control ""but the site is just data and is no more political than a phone book."" While the website defines mass shootings to include fatalities and injuries, a key federal government report defined ""mass shooting"" and ""mass murder"" as four or more fatalities. The federal government’s more restrictive definition means it tends to count fewer incidents than Mass Shooting Tracker. Using 2013, the most recent year for which federal data is available, the Congressional Research Service found 25 mass shooting incidents -- far less than the 363 counted by Mass Shooting Tracker. We looked for 2015 data for the federal definition of mass shootings, but it isn’t yet available. Based on its definitions, we would expect the total to be significantly lower than Mass Shooting Tracker, but we can’t say by how much. USA Today has been tracking the data and found approximately 18 mass killings by firearms so far in 2015. A spokesman for Wasserman Schultz defended her use of a broad definition of mass shooting. ""I think the main point is that mass shootings that result in both deaths and injuries are occurring too frequently in this country,"" spokesman Sean Bartlett said. ""And it’s both reasonable and publicly understood that a mass shooting does not necessarily have to require a minimum amount of deaths, because the intent of the shooter is to kill and instill fear. Regardless of the outcome of a shooting, there are still serious physical and psychological effects."" Experts’ caveats An academic told us that one problem with Mass Shooting Tracker is it lumps together incidents that are different -- for example, those shot in bar fights are counted along with school shootings. ""This is not consistent with the motivations behind events like Columbine, Virginia Tech, Aurora, Tucson, or Sandy Hook, and therefore are not comparable in the way we think of mass shootings,"" said Jaclyn Schildkraut, at State University of New York System. ""By including such events to try and quantify a phenomenon (though the loss of one life is one too many), these sources essentially are inflating the statistics."" Northeastern University professor James Alan Fox said it’s the fatal shootings that draw the most attention. ""If six people are shot and they survive, it has nowhere near the impact as six people killed. ...It’s qualitatively different,"" he said. Politicians or others who want to make a point about guns choose a set of data and a definition that reinforces the point they want to make. People who want more gun control tend to choose more expansive definitions. ""Those who want to create a sense of crisis over the violence will tend to use lower cutoffs, while those who want to minimize the problem will use higher cutoffs,"" said Gary Kleck, a criminology professor at Florida State University. Our ruling Wasserman Schultz said, ""380 Americans have been killed in 294 mass shootings in 2015 alone."" She cited the crowdsourcing site Mass Shooting Tracker, which showed 379 people killed in 296 mass shootings. But Mass Shooting Tracker uses an extremely broad definition of what many people would consider a mass shooting. If she had used a more restrictive definition that only counts incidents with deaths, as the federal government does, she would have come up with a much lower number. The Congressional Research Service counted 25 incidents in 2013, compared with 363 incidents counted by Mass Shooting Tracker.

"""While 38 percent of (firearms) dealers that were inspected in 2011 were noncompliant with federal law, only 0.05 percent of inspected dealers had their licenses revoked.""","Following the mass shooting at an Oregon community college that left nine dead, Hillary Clinton unveiled a plan to tackle gun violence that includes expanding background checks, banning assault weapons, and going after negligent gun dealers and manufacturers. ""Due to lobbying efforts by the NRA, these bad actors are granted unique protections in our laws, and the country’s law enforcement agencies often face barriers when attempting to hold them accountable,"" reads the plan released Oct. 5. ""While 38 percent of (firearms) dealers that were inspected in 2011 were noncompliant with federal law, only 0.05 percent of inspected dealers had their licenses revoked."" We were curious about her claim that less than a percent of firearms dealers found to be noncompliant had their licenses revoked by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, or ATF, the agency tasked with overseeing gun sales. Clinton’s numbers are slightly off, but she’s right that it’s extremely rare for a noncompliant dealer to lose its license. Whether that means ""bad actors"" are getting away, however, remains up for debate. Not a straight shot to revocation Clinton’s spokesperson Josh Schwerin told us the campaign got its figures from a 2013 Justice Department audit of the ATF following the Sandy Hook shooting. According to the audit, the ATF found 62 percent of more than 10,000 inspected gun dealers did not violate firearms law in 2011. Clinton’s campaign took this to mean that 38 percent of dealers were noncompliant. But the actual figure is closer to 31 percent, because about 6 percent of gun dealers were categorized as ""other"" and an additional percent opted to give up their license. Out of the noncompliant dealers, only 71 had their licenses revoked. That’s 0.05 percent of all dealers active that year (over 120,000), but 0.68 percent of inspected dealers. Clearly, both are small numbers. Why do so few noncompliant dealers get their licenses revoked? For starters, the Firearm Owners Protection Act of 1986 stipulates that the ATF can only take away licenses when the dealer is ""willfully"" violating the law. So rather than revoking licenses automatically, ATF gives dealers chances to redeem themselves. If the ATF finds that a dealer has been noncompliant, it first issues a report of violations. More significant violations — for example, not properly logging gun acquisitions and gun sales — or repeated paperwork errors prompt a warning letter or a warning conference. In 2011, as with most years, 97 percent of noncompliant dealers agreed to make changes to become compliant.  ""There’s a difference between people having a hard time trying to do the right thing versus people who don’t have any interest in doing the right thing at all,"" said Suzanne Dabkowski, a public information officer and industry operations investigator at ATF’s field division in Columbus, Ohio. ""Most people do seem to want to do it correctly."" According to the ATF, it’s rare for a dealer to demonstrate a blatant disregard for the law — ""willful"" noncompliance. This can include serious violations like knowingly selling to straw buyers (someone buying a gun for someone else who wouldn’t be able to pass the background check) or minors or consistently ignoring ATF warnings, said Mike Bouchard, a former ATF assistant director for field operations. Only in those cases does the ATF recommend revocation, and a separate process kicks in. The recommendation first goes through ATF internal review, including legal consultation. If the recommendation is approved, the dealer can request a hearing and make the case that its violations were not willful. Should the ATF decide to press on, the dealer can take the case to the U.S District Court. With all this back and forth, revoking a license can take over two years, according to the Dept. of Justice audit. Meanwhile, dealers facing pending license loss can and do still sell firearms. Procedural pains or procedural justice In her gun plan, Clinton promised to increase ATF funding and ""aggressively enforce current law"" to weed out rogue dealers. It’s important to note license revocation requires an extremely high burden of proof, thanks to the ""willful"" violation requirement, according to Lindsay Nichols, senior attorney for the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. For example, she said, if a dealer is selling guns without background checks, it could falsely claim that it just forgot to create the required record. Similarly, it would be very difficult for the ATF to prove that a dealer is abetting a straw purchase ""unless there is video or audio footage,"" Nichols said. Gun dealers, however, contend that the inspections regime ensures due process. Many violations reported by the ATF are paperwork mistakes that don’t endanger the public (i.e. writing ""Y"" instead of ""Yes""), said Larry Keane, the senior vice president of the firearms industry’s trade association, the National Shooting Sports Foundation. ""The dealers have certain rights, and ATF has certain rights to shut them down if they’re bad apples,"" he said. ""No one minimizes the paperwork violations. That still results in warning letters or more. ...The idea that dealers are selling guns to criminals willy nilly is just false."" Many of the most common violations are indeed paperwork errors, but the list also includes not obtaining identification, not reporting multiple handgun sales, and selling guns to someone likely to be prohibited from purchasing a firearm. Here’s a snapshot:  If bad dealers are getting away, said Bouchard, ""it’s a resource issue."" ATF’s staff size, 2,500 agents, hasn’t increased in four decades unlike other law enforcement agencies. To conduct all the inspections due in a year, the agency would need to increase its manpower by 45 percent, according to the Dept. of Justice. On top of that, by law, the ATF is not allowed to keep a centralized electronic database, and it must prioritize other duties (i.e. explosives inspections) over cyclical inspections of firearms dealers. As a result, 58 percent of dealers haven’t been inspected within five years, the legal requirement. In practice, visits actually come only once a decade, reports the Washington Post. ""There are so few agents and inspectors to do all the work,"" said Bouchard. Our ruling Clinton said, ""While 38 percent of dealers that were inspected in 2011 were noncompliant with federal law, only 0.05 percent of inspected dealers had their licenses revoked."" The numbers are slightly off. About 30 percent of inspected dealers had violated firearms regulations in 2011, and about 0.7 percent of them had their licenses revoked. That’s because revocations are only allowed when the dealer is ""willfully"" violating the law, which some say is a huge legal obstacle. The inspections and revocations process gives noncompliant dealers the chance to demonstrate willingness to comply, and the vast majority say that they will",Mostly True,"October 8, 2015"
"""States with the most gun laws tend to have the fewest gun deaths.""","In the wake of a Oct. 1 shooting spree in Oregon that killed 10, many -- including President Barack Obama -- are calling for more gun control laws. ""There is a gun for roughly every man, woman, and child in America,"" Obama said in remarks the day of the shooting. ""So how can you, with a straight face, make the argument that more guns will make us safer? We know that states with the most gun laws tend to have the fewest gun deaths. So the notion that gun laws don't work, or just will make it harder for law-abiding citizens, and criminals will still get their guns is not borne out by the evidence."" There is plenty of debate over the effectiveness of gun control laws, so we decided to dig into Obama’s sweeping claim: that ""states with the most gun laws tend to have the fewest gun deaths."" We ran this claim past several experts and found that the statistic generally holds up, but the implications are less clear. Cause and effect The meat of the claim comes from a 2015 National Journal investigation, which concluded that ""the states with the most gun laws see the fewest gun-related deaths."" The report considered seven types of gun control: handgun permits, background checks, handgun registries, ""stand your ground"" laws, concealed carry permits, open carry permits and gun purchase waiting period. It found that states that had generally more restrictive laws within these categories generally had fewer annual gun deaths. Here’s a chart by National Journal showing the states with the fewest and most gun deaths per 100,000 people, compared to each state’s’ gun laws (more blue = more restrictive laws). You should look at the chart that shows all 50 states.  There are some limitations to this kind of research, notably that they do not determine cause-and-effect: whether a state has fewer gun deaths because of the law, said Adam Winkler, a University of California Los Angeles law professor and second amendment expert. Other demographic characteristics -- such as education level, marital stability, rural or urban -- might explain the fewer gun deaths in a particular state. Setting that caveat aside, Winkler said Obama’s statement is true. There are also a couple of outliers to National Journal’s report. For example, New Hampshire has some of the least restrictive gun laws but also the seventh-lowest gun death rate. An academic study published by the American Medical Association in 2013 found similar results: ""A higher number of firearm laws in a state was associated with a lower rate of firearm fatalities in the state."" In a commentary on the 2013 study, Garen Wintemute, director of UC Davis’ Violence Prevention Research Program, pointed out that the correlation between restrictive laws and fewer deaths ""essentially disappeared"" when firearm ownership rates were taken into account. ""Perhaps these laws decrease mortality by decreasing firearm ownership, in which case firearm ownership mediates the association,"" Wintemute wrote. ""But perhaps, and more plausibly, these laws are more readily enacted in states where the prevalence of firearm ownership is low — there will be less opposition to them — and firearm ownership confounds the association."" While wary of making such a general claim, Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, said Obama’s claim is generally accurate. In many states, individual gun laws have shown to be associated with fewer gun-related deaths. He linked us to some of his own research showing, for example, a reduction in murders committed with firearms followed a handgun purchase permit law in Connecticut. In contrast, the repeal of a permit law in Missouri preceded a rise in firearm-caused murders. We looked for evidence to contradict Obama’s statement, and found several complaints from those who favor gun rights. James Agresti, a gun control expert for the conservative-leaning think tank Just Facts, wrote in an email to reporters that statements like Obama’s are ""meaningless"" and ""subjective and ill-defined,"" linking to a Just Facts article that said classification systems that evaluate gun laws state-by-state can be ""haphazard."" Agresti added that the claim ignores the number of lives saved by defensive gun use, and the fact that some states with highest gun-ownership rates also have low homicide rates. Overall, though, we found nothing that offered an outright contradiction to the National Journal analysis. States with laws that restrict guns do tend to have lower death rates, as Obama said. Suicide vs. homicide A notable critique of Obama’s claim is that these gun deaths include suicides -- which account for more than half of all gun deaths -- and Obama was delivering remarks in the context of how to prevent future mass shootings. While research does show that gun laws correlate with fewer firearm-caused suicides, there’s not universal agreement on the effect of gun laws on murders. In his commentary on the 2013 study, Wintemute noted that the vast majority of the observed decrease in gun deaths were suicides. Our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker did a calculation of their own and found that when suicides are taken out of the picture, there’s not as clear a correlation between more gun laws and fewer non-suicide gun deaths. (They rated Obama’s statement as two out of four Pinocchios.) Obama’s use of this factoid is deceptive because he was selling gun control as a way to stymie murders, not suicide by gun, said David Kopel, a gun rights advocate and research director of the conservative Independence Institute in Denver. He likened it to a car salesman telling a family a car is ""safe, according to government studies."" The family takes this to mean the car will protect them in an accident, but the salesman was actually referring to the fact that studies have found the car to be safe for the environment. Experts do, though, see reason to believe that stronger gun laws will reduce homicides, as well, even if the research isn’t conclusive yet. One survey of about 150 researchers actively publishing work on guns found that 71 percent believe that strong gun laws reduce the number of homicides, compared with12 percent who disagree. While there are always exceptions, ""the research on the whole shows that if you make it more difficult for individuals -- especially individuals with a criminal background -- to obtain firearms you will prevent some gun-related criminal offenses,"" said Jay Corzine, a sociology professor at the University of Central Florida who studies homicide and violent crime. Our ruling Obama said, ""States with the most gun laws tend to have the fewest gun deaths."" Research shows that the more gun laws a state has, the fewer gun deaths there are. Obama gets some wiggle room because he said ""tend to"" as opposed to making a definitive statement. The problem is, however, that this is an overly general statement. The research doesn’t prove a universal cause-and-effect relationship between gun laws and fewer gun deaths; it might just be a correlation. Some laws are more effective than others, and other cultural, demographic or socioeconomic factors might be the driving force behind the number of gun deaths in different states",Mostly True,"October 6, 2015"
"""More preschoolers are shot dead each year than police officers are in the line of duty.""","The Oregon shootings raise the question of what can be done to reduce the frequency of gun violence. New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof argued in favor of smaller steps that might enjoy public support, such as requiring safe storage at home and a 10-year ban for anyone convicted of domestic violence or assault. Kristof said the country would do well to tackle this problem as a matter of public health. To drive home that point, he made a grim comparison. ""In America, more preschoolers are shot dead each year (82 in 2013) than police officers are in the line of duty (27 in 2013), according to figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the FBI,"" Kristof wrote in an Oct. 3, 2015 op-ed. A reader asked us to see if that was accurate. We found that it was, and for more years than the one he cited. We also stress-tested his comparison by defining preschoolers more narrowly than he did and for the most part, the comparison still holds up. The Federal Bureau of Investigation tracks the deaths of law enforcement officers, whether they serve in the smallest sheriff’s department or a large federal agency. In 2013, 26 officers died in shootings. (Kristof was off by one because he included a non-shooting death.) Counting the deaths of preschoolers is a bit more complicated. You have to decide the age range that defines a preschooler, and whether to include both accidental and intentional killings. We learned from Kristof that he took preschoolers to mean every child from a newborn to 4-years-old, and he included gun deaths under all circumstances. Since public health routinely focuses on accidents, that is consistent with Kristof’s approach and gun violence normally includes homicide. Kristof said he picked his age group based on the definition used by the U.S. Education Department. The agency’s guide to Title 1 services (aid for lower income children) leaves the range rather open-ended. It says ""For the purpose of Title I, children from birth to the age that the LEA (Local Education Agency) provides a free public elementary education may receive preschool services."" Some school districts might take children at age 5, in others, it might be 6. Kristof’s 0 to 4 seems defensible. However, we also found that the CDC often considers preschoolers to be children from the ages of 3 to 5. We used both age groups when we pulled death statistics from the CDC’s WISQAR fatal injury database. This table using FBI and CDC data shows the results.  For the age range Kristof used, firearm deaths of preschoolers exceeded those of law enforcement officers in every year back to 2008. For the more restricted CDC age range, his statement held up in four out of the past six years.  Our ruling Kristof said that more preschoolers are shot dead each year than are on-duty police officers. For children aged 0-4, that is accurate for the past six years. For children aged 3-5, the statement is true in most years, but not in every year",Mostly True,"October 6, 2015"
"""90% of Americans want national background checks that close loopholes.""","An adviser to a group focused on turning Texas Democratic-blue suggested after the fatal shootings in Oregon that there’s a huge consensus nationally in favor of mandating a background check before any gun purchase. Jeremy Bird, a Chicago-based senior adviser to Battleground Texas, said in an Oct. 2, 2015, tweet: ""90% of Americans want national background checks that close loopholes. 9-0. Won't solve whole problem but is a start."" He posted that comment the day after a man opened fire at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Ore., killing nine. According to news accounts, authorities subsequently collected 14 guns owned by the man, who killed himself at the scene. Hours before Bird tweeted, ATF Assistant Special Agent in Charge Celinez Nunez said at a news conference that all of the weapons were purchased legally, seven of them by the shooter or his family members in the last three years. And was Bird right about sweeping support for universal background checks? A previous ‘True’ Bird’s claim rang a bell. In April 2013, we found True a claim by Lee Leffingwell, then Austin’s mayor, that 90 percent of Americans and 74 percent of National Rifle Association members supported background checks of gun purchasers. Polls taken in 2012 and 2013 supported both figures, though one taken closest to Leffingwell’s comment indicated support among all Americans possibly slipping a bit below 90 percent. Currently, background checks are required in sales by federally licensed gun dealers but not for gun sales by private sellers. But President Barack Obama and others have called for requiring criminal background checks for all gun sales. In 2013, the National Rifle Association suggested that an expansion would fail to rope in criminals. A January 2013 Pew Research Center poll found 85 percent of all respondents in favor of making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks, with comparable support from Republicans, Democrats and independents, Pew said. The margin of error for the entire sample was 2.9 percentage points. Several 2015 polls By email to our inquiry about Bird’s statement, Pew spokesman Brian Mahl pointed out a center survey of 2,002 adults taken from July 14-20, 2015, that found (again) 85 percent of respondents in favor of making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks. Pew said in its August 2015 results summary: ""While there is broad support for several specific gun policy proposals – and opinion on these measures has not changed significantly since 2013 – the public continues to be more evenly divided in fundamental attitudes about whether it is more important to control gun ownership or to protect the right of Americans to own guns. Currently, 50% say it is more important to control gun ownership, while 47% say it is more important to protect the right of Americans to own guns."" Our own web search turned up a survey of 1,326 adults, intended to be a representative national sample, taken Jan. 2-16, 2015 by researchers at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Some 84 percent of respondents favored requiring background checks for all gun sales, compared to 89 percent in a similar survey taken two years before, a ""slight erosion,"" the authors wrote. We noted before a January 2013 CBS/New York Times poll indicating 92 percent of all the respondents at that time favoring background checks for all potential gun buyers. The poll had an overall margin of error of three percentage points. A more recent CBS News poll, taken of 1,047 registered voters July 29-Aug. 2, 2015,  showed 88 percent of respondents favoring background checks for all gun purchases including, CBS News said, ""large majorities of Republicans (81 percent), Democrats (93 percent), and independents (89 percent)."" Quinnipiac University polls National voter surveys by Quinnipiac University continue to show widespread support for universal background checks. We noted in our Leffingwell check that a national Quinnipiac University survey of 772 registered voters, taken Jan. 30 through Feb. 4, 2013, found 92 percent supporting background checks for all gun buyers. That survey had a margin of error of 2.3 percentage points. A subsequent Quinnipiac University survey, taken of 1,944 registered voters from Feb. 27, 2013 through March 4, 2013, found 88 percent in favor of background checks for all gun buyers. The poll had a margin of error of 2.2 percentage points. By email, Battleground Texas replied to our inquiry by pointing out a news story in The Hill, a Washington, D.C., newspaper, stating that a June 2014 Quinnipiac University poll found 92 percent of surveyed voters in favor of universal background checks for gun purchases. The survey reached 1,446 registered voters from June 24-30, 2014 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 2.6 percentage points. More recently, a Quinnipiac University survey of 1,574 registered voters, taken Sept. 17-21, 2015, found 93 percent of respondents in favor of requiring background checks for all gun buyers. Similarly, 93 percent of respondents with a legally acquired gun in the household indicated support for such checks. The poll had a margin of error of 2.5 percentage points. Quinnipiac University Survey (Sept. 17-21, 2015)  SOURCE: Press release,  ""Don't Shut Down Government, U.S. Voters Say 3-1, Quinnipiac University National Poll Finds; Voters Oppose Admitting Syrian Refugees,"" Quinnipiac University Poll, Sept. 28, 2015 Texas poll shows less support there And in Texas? A February 2013 University of Texas/Texas Tribune poll of 1,200 Texas voters found 78 percent of respondents somewhat or strongly supporting criminal and mental health background checks for all U.S. gun purchases, including at gun shows and for private sales. Those results had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.3 percentage points. A June 2013 follow-up survey found 74 percent of the 1,200 respondents somewhat or strongly supporting such background checks. Our ruling Bird said: ""90% of Americans want national background checks that close loopholes."" Polls continue to show a strong tilt in favor of background checks prior to all gun purchases; the latest available poll before Bird spoke found 93 percent of adults in favor. Then again, the popularity of this idea may bear watching. Other 2015 polls found as few as 84 percent of respondents backing the universal checks",True,"October 5, 2015"
"Number of Americans killed by terrorism in the last decade: 24. Number of Americans killed by guns in the last decade: 280,024.","In the wake of the Oct. 1 shooting at Umpqua Community College in Oregon, President Barack Obama tasked the media to put the number of gun violence-related deaths into perspective. ""Have news organizations tally up the number of Americans who've been killed through terrorist attacks in the last decade and the number of Americans who've been killed by gun violence, and post those side by side on your news reports,"" he said in his address on the shooting. ""We spend over a trillion dollars, and pass countless laws, and devote entire agencies to preventing terrorist attacks on our soil, and rightfully so. And yet, we have a Congress that explicitly blocks us from even collecting data on how we could potentially reduce gun deaths. How can that be?""  Obama's underlying point was to highlight the lack of resources and legislative action taken on gun violence. Some have questioned the merit of such a comparison -- for example, critics have pointed out that cigarettes kill more people than guns. We're not weighing in on that debate. Rather, we're looking just at the data.  Multiple outlets obliged (though each came up with slightly different numbers). Several readers asked us to check out one specific comparison widely shared on Facebook and Twitter. It was created by NowThis, a New York-based news company that produces content specifically for social media. The image says that 24 Americans have been killed by terrorism in the last decade, while 280,024 Americans were killed by guns. While NowThis’ numbers aren’t perfect, the overarching point is accurate. There have been far more deaths from gun violence than from terrorist attacks. Walking through the math Let’s start with the tally for terrorist-related deaths. NowThis senior editorial producer Versha Sharma told PolitiFact that the 24 figure refers to the number of U.S. citizens killed by terrorist attacks on U.S. soil, and does not include deaths abroad. Sharma acknowledged that this could have been made clear in the graphic. But she maintained that it’s more apt to compare domestic gun deaths to domestic terrorism deaths. Counting terrorist attacks abroad, she said, would make it an apples to oranges comparison. The number comes from the nonpartisan think tank the New America Foundation’s count of lethal jihadist attacks on U.S. soil from 2005 to 2015. It includes for example the four people killed during the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013 and the 13 deaths from the Fort Hood shooting in 2009. To get to 280,024 gun deaths, NowThis compiled data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Vital Statistics System and the Mass Shooting Tracker, a crowd-sourced project that tallies deaths and injuries in mass shootings. According to the CDC, the number of violent gun deaths between 2005 and 2013 (the latest year on record) was 279,976. That includes suicides, homicides, and police-related shootings. Mass Shooting Tracker counts 389 mass shooting gun deaths in 2014 and 375 so far in 2015. There are, however, a few issues with these numbers. For starters, a spokesperson for New America told us it would have been more accurate to include lives lost to both jihadist and non-jihadist extreme violence (47 deaths from 2005 to 2015) for a total count of 71 deaths from terrorist attacks on U.S. soil. Secondly, Mass Shooting Tracker, as the name implies, only tracks deaths from mass shootings, defined by the group as when four more people are shot in an event. If we look at all gun-related deaths as the CDC does from the past two years, the numbers are much higher. According the nonprofit project the Gun Violence Archive, there were 12,562 gun deaths in 2014 and 9,959 in 2015 thus far. That’s a grand total of 301,797 firearm-related deaths in the past decade, compared to 71 deaths from domestic acts of terrorism.  If we factor in terrorist attacks overseas, the comparison is still stark. From 2004 to 2014, 303 Americans were killed in terrorist attacks worldwide, according to State Department reports. During that same time frame, 320,523 Americans were killed because of gun violence. Here’s a breakdown:    Our ruling A viral image says the number of Americans killed by terrorism in the last decade is 24, while the number of Americans killed by guns in the last decade is 280,024. NowThis, the creators of the image, told us they only counted lives lost to domestic jihadist attacks, though the image doesn’t specify that. If we look at deaths due to all extremist attacks on U.S. soil, the number goes up to 71. A more accurate count for gun deaths between 2005 and 2015 is 301,797. Though the image’s numbers are slightly off, that doesn’t undercut the point: guns have claimed many more lives than terrorist attacks",Mostly True,"October 5, 2015"
"About ""3 percent of murders and crimes are committed with guns from people who actually (legally) purchase those guns.""","The public debate to the shooting in Oregon so far has followed a familiar script. Some observers focus on cracks in mental health services. Some highlight families who fail to keep weapons away from disturbed sons and fathers. Others talk about background checks and reining in the firepower available to private citizens. Joe Scarborough, host of MSNBC’s Morning Joe, trained his sights on the underground market in guns. ""Isn't it true that only like 3 percent of murders and crimes are committed with guns from people who actually purchase those guns?"" he asked a guest on his Oct. 2 show. ""Isn't this a big trafficking problem, too?"" Scarborough supports background checks, but his focus on black market guns caught our eye. We decided to dig into the stat that only a tiny fraction of violent crimes involve guns that were purchased on the up-and-up. From the data and experts we reached, we learned Scarborough might be correct, but the data don’t precisely confirm it. Before we review the data, we should note that Scarborough’s claim is a bit ambiguous. He might have meant that out of all violent crimes, 3 percent involve a legally purchased firearm. But it’s also possible that he was thinking that out of a smaller set of violent crimes -- those involving a firearm -- the firearm was purchased legally 3 percent of the time. (We reached out to Scarborough and did not hear back.) Philip Cook, a professor of economics and sociology at Duke University, has done some of the most recent and detailed research on where criminals get their guns. But note: His work begins with the criminals, not the crimes -- which was Scarborough’s approach. Cook knows of no study that takes the crime as the starting point. And for good reason. ""The problem is that only a very small fraction of gun crimes result in the recovery of the weapon or in any other way allow us to determine how the gun was acquired by the person who committed the crime,"" Cook told us. On the other hand, if Scarborough had said that 3 percent of criminals who use guns get them legally, he would have come closer to the truth. There are still big issues with that, but he would have found some support in Cook’s work. The Chicago Crime Lab study Cook and colleagues Susan Parker and Harold Pollack at the University of Chicago interviewed 99 inmates of the Cook County Jail in Chicago. They were looking for criminals who were likely to have used a gun or had ready access to one. The authors described the group of participants as ""a convenience sample of gun-involved, criminally active men living in greater Chicago."" ""It is difficult to say how representative they are of the larger population with that description,"" they wrote. ""For that reason, we do not place much emphasis on the statistical results, as opposed to the qualitative patterns that emerged from these data."" That said, of the 70 inmates who had possessed a firearm, only 2, or 2.9 percent, had bought it at a gun store. The report found that percentage was in line with the findings of the Chicago Police Department when it traced weapons seized from suspected gang members. (For a glimpse into how guns move through a community, Cook's full article is good reading.) There are some important caveats however. First, Cook noted that it’s possible to buy a gun illegally from a gun store. You can use a fake ID or employ a straw purchaser (someone who can pass a background check who buys the weapon on your behalf). Furthermore, just because the rest of the people interviewed didn’t purchase a gun at a gun store doesn’t mean they acquired it illegally. ""It’s possible to make a legal acquisition from another source – a gift from a family member, a purchase from a private seller, etc.,"" Cook said. ""Whether transactions of that sort are legal depend on the details of the transaction and local regulations."" Cook also cautioned that the numbers from the Chicago study might not apply across the country. The national data In 2004, the government conducted its periodic Survey of Inmates in State and Federal Correctional Facilities. It found that among inmates who had a gun when they committed their crime (16 percent of all prisoners), about 11 percent had bought the firearm at a retail store, a pawn shop, a flea market or a gun show. Another 37 percent had gotten it from a friend or family member. About 40 percent said they got it illegally on the black market, from a drug dealer or by stealing it. But the same caveats apply. A retail purchase might not have been legal and a gift from a family member might not be illegal. A 1994 study by researchers James Wright and Peter Rossi came up with a larger percentage of potentially legal purchases. They surveyed prisoners in 10 states. About 21 percent said they acquired their weapons from a gun or other ""customary retail outlets"" as the researchers put it. About one out of four came through gray or black market sources. However, gun laws were looser when that data was collected. The Brady Bill and its background check provisions passed the year the study was published. Ultimately, there are holes in the data. But Cook said while 3 percent or 10 percent might not be the exact number of legally purchased firearms used by criminals, the fraction is in that ballpark. ""I think it’s safe to say that a low percentage of criminal assaults and robberies are committed with guns that were acquired by legal purchase from a gun store,"" Cook said. Joseph Olson, a professor at Hamline University School of Law and former board member of the National Rifle Association, believes that the number of legally acquired firearms used by criminals is negligible. ""Criminals don’t go through background checks because they know they wouldn't pass them,"" Olson said. Olson said with homicides, there are two key exceptions. Legal firearms are often found when the killings occur duing domestic violence or mass shootings. Our ruling Scarborough said that about ""3 percent of murders and crimes are committed with guns from people who actually (legally) purchase those guns."" Recent studies that look at prisoners who had a gun when they committed a crime found that between 3 and 11 percent purchased the weapon at a store or gun show.  But the studies only tell us where the guns came from, not whether they were acquired legally, and there are issues with using the data to reach the conclusion Scarborough did, experts told us",Half True,"October 5, 2015"
"""We sell 40 percent of our guns without a background check.""","As the country grapples with Thursday’s mass shooting at an Oregon community college, a retired astronaut whose wife survived a killing spree four years ago is leading the charge for stricter gun control. Mark Kelly is married to former congresswoman Gabby Giffords, who was severely injured in a 2011 mass shooting in Tucson that left 10 others dead. Following the assassination attempt, Kelly and Giffords created Americans for Responsible Solutions, a super PAC that supports gun control.   ""One thing is really clear. We sell 40 percent of our guns without a background check,"" Kelly said during CNN’s State of the Union on Oct. 4. ""That means felons, people who are dangerously mentally ill have easy access to guns."" The 40 percent figure was often invoked by gun control advocates who wanted stricter background check laws after the Newtown, Conn., elementary school mass shooting. We and other fact-checkers have pointed out that it’s based on outdated research. We wanted to know if there had been any updates that would give this statistic more weight. The 21-year-old statistic, recently reproduced in an unpublished survey, is still the best figure available, experts told us, thanks to a two-decade ban on federal funding of gun violence research. Virtually all iterations of the 40 percent claim can be traced to a 1994 survey by Duke University’s Philip Cook and the University of Chicago’s Jens Ludwig. Kelly’s source is a 2013 white paper that cites Cook and Ludwig’s survey as its source, according to a spokesperson for Americans for Responsible Solutions. The survey was based on a small sample (251 people) and counted background checks on firearm purchases before the 1996 Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, which required federal background checks on firearm purchases, was enacted. There’s debate among researchers on whether the 40 percent figure still holds true today, and Cook and Ludwig have both said that no one knows the current percentage of guns sold without a background check. Robert Spitzer, a SUNY Cortland political science professor and author of The Politics of Gun Control, noted that the background check statistic is ""notoriously slippery,"" because gun sales that don’t go through a federally licensed seller are, as you would expect, not subject to formal record keeping. ""How would a researcher identify a sufficiently large and representative sample of non-background check gun purchases/exchanges, given the absence of a paper trail?"" Spitzer said. ""My general sense is that 40 percent might be on the high side but is certainly possible."" Nevertheless, it’s the best estimate we have, said Jon Vernick, co-director of the Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, adding, ""There's no good reason to believe that the number has changed substantially — though we can't know for sure."" Ludwig told PolitiFact that he can see why people use the 1994 survey as the benchmark, ""even though everyone recognizes the estimate is now old."" So why is the most recent statistic on gun purchases without background checks about two decades old? There’s very little funding for research on gun violence. Problems with methodology also play a role, but the 1996 appropriations bill, experts said, is mainly to blame for the lack of research dollars. Strong-armed by the powerful gun lobby, Congress wrote in a provision that effectively banned the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from researching the roots of gun violence. ""None of the funds made available for injury prevention and control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may be used to advocate or promote gun control,"" the bill reads. ""It basically was a shot across the bow by Congress on the part of the NRA,"" Mark Rosenberg, former director of the CDC’s National Center for Injury Control and Prevention, told the Washington Post. ""All federally funded research was shut down."" As a result of the attack on CDC funding, all government funding for the issue was stifled, agreed David Hemenway, director of Harvard University’s Injury Control Research Center. Private foundations, too, were wary of putting dollars toward a controversial and politically divisive topic, he said. (There are fewer than five foundations providing the funding today, said Garen Wintemute, director of UC Davis’ Violence Prevention Research Program, to Slate.) Just a few years ago, it looked like things were about to change for gun violence research. In the wake of the Newtown shooting in 2012, President Barack Obama issued a proclamation directing the CDC and other federal agencies to look into the causes of gun violence. In spite of the presidential pressure, the 20-year moratorium on gun violence research wasn’t really lifted, and researchers haven’t exactly heeded Obama’s call. Six days after the Charleston, S.C., church shooting on June 17, 2015, House Republicans blocked an amendment that would have funded CDC gun violence research in the next fiscal year. Instead, the appropriations bill ""continues the general provision to prevent any funds provided from being spent on gun research."" Advocates of the funding ban say the research is inherently biased to support stricter gun control and is irrelevant to the mission of the CDC. In the words of outgoing House Speaker John Boehner, ""a gun is not a disease."" Hemenway has managed to get around the lack of federal and private funding for gun research with a recent project financed by the Fund for a Safer Future, a program aimed at reducing gun violence. He told PolitiFact that the Harvard Injury Control Research Center conducted a 2015 national survey with a sample size over 3,000 that confirmed the 40 percent of sales without a background check figure. However, this study has not been published, and we could not read it for ourselves, so we cannot factor it into this fact-check. Our ruling Kelly said, ""We sell 40 percent of our guns without a background check."" The figure he’s citing comes from a 21-year-old survey with a small sample size before a key gun law took effect. Even its authors say they’re not sure if it holds true today. Still, there are few credible alternative statistics because of a two-decade dearth of gun violence research funding",Half True,"October 4, 2015"
"""Eighty-three law enforcement officers have died in the line of duty this year. Twenty-four of them were shot and killed in cold blood.""","Years have passed, but not the collective chill that comes when our minds are drawn back to Sept. 11, 2001. In the days leading up to this year’s 14th anniversary of the terrorists’ attacks, Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle issued a press release, urging Georgians to stop to reflect on the critical role that law enforcement officers play in our communities. ""Eighty-three law enforcement officers have died in the line of duty this year,"" Cagle said in the statement issued Sept. 8, ""Twenty-four of them were shot and killed in cold blood."" Those are sobering national statistics, the sort that have been replayed more lately -- the result of angry displays and discourse that have escalated since the August 2014 killing of a black teenager by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri. But are the stats accurate? PolitiFact decided to check. We contacted Ben Fry, Cagle’s chief of staff, who said the numbers came from the Officer Down Memorial Page, a resource that he said was recommended by the Georgia Sheriffs Association. The privately run website is dedicated to memorializing police officers who die in the line of duty and is constantly updated. It showed a 2015 death count of 92 by Sunday, Sept. 20, that included seven Georgia law enforcement officers. The causes of death varied. Twenty-eight died from gunfire, two accidentally. Auto and motorcycle accidents claimed 24 lives. Vehicle pursuits killed four, and vehicle assaults three. Heart attacks accounted for 15 deaths, and a fall caused one death. Five law enforcement officers died in 2015 of illnesses related to the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, according to the website. Texas and Louisiana have had the most officers die this year, 10 and 9, respectively. The website numbers track those in Cagle’s statement; they’re more current and so higher. We decided to spot check the website’s data against information gathered for the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial, as well media reports. The names of officers who die in the line of duty are etched in marble each spring, in conjunction with National Police Week, at the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial in  Washington D.C. That group keeps up-to-date data on law enforcement deaths and reported 92 on Sunday (identical to what the Officer Down Memorial Page was reporting that day.) We also used Google to verify all seven of the officer deaths in Georgia noted on the Officer Down Memorial Page. This included DeKalb County Police Officer Kevin Toatley, who was killed Saturday night when his patrol car was struck head on by a vehicle traveling in the wrong direction on South Fulton Parkway. The Officer Down Memorial Page, which has data that appears spot on, says that with the count of 92 deaths as of Sept. 20, all law enforcement deaths for 2015 are down 1 percent this year, compared to 2014. Gunfire deaths are down 26 percent; and auto-related deaths, at 36, are up 13 percent. (In May of this year. the FBI released its preliminary stats for 2014 law enforcement deaths in the line of duty. It showed 51 law enforcement officers were feloniously killed, meaning they were killed with ""criminal intent, as opposed to by accident), an increase of  almost 89 percent from 2013 when the death count was 27.  Between 1980 and 2014, an average of 64 law enforcement officers died this way each year. The 2013 death count was the lowest in this 35-year period.) With all the conversation about relations between the police and the communities they serve, that’s valuable information to know, especially when a recent poll by Rasmussen Reports.com suggests that all those discussions may be influencing public thinking. The telephone survey showed that 58 percent of likely U.S. voters believe there’s a war on police in America today. Our conclusion:  In the days leading up to the 9/11 anniversary, Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle issued a press release, urging Georgians to stop to reflect on the critical role that law enforcement officers play in our communities. ""Eighty-three law enforcement officers have died in the line of duty this year. Twenty-four of them were shot and killed in cold blood,"" he said. His numbers come from a group that works to diligently track data and pay tribute to law enforcement officers who die in the line of duty",True,"September 22, 2015"
"""In countries where there are higher, more strict gun laws, there is more gun violence.""","The murders of two television journalists in Virginia renewed the debate about gun control in America. On Fox News’ The Five, panelist Juan Williams said he feels more threatened by the number of guns on the street in New York and Washington, D.C., than he does by the militant Muslim group ISIS. Show co-host Eric Bolling shot back, ""In countries where there are higher, more strict gun laws, there is more gun violence."" We decided to see if Bolling had his facts straight. We couldn’t find proof that he did, and neither Bolling nor Fox News got back to us to show otherwise. There is no hard and fast yardstick to compare gun laws across nations, but there are some rough indicators. The United States is unusual in framing gun ownership as a right, so at the most basic legal level, most countries begin from a more restrictive starting point. There’s helpful data on gun regulation in other countries from the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva, Switzerland. According to the group’s 2011 small arms survey, personal protection is not a sufficient reason to own a weapon in Australia and the United Kingdom. In fact, in the United Kingdom, the 1996 slayings of 16 school children in Scotland led to a ban on private handguns. Japan also bans handguns. Canada requires all would-be gun owners to get a license to own a gun. They must pass a background check and complete a safety course. If they then go and buy a weapon, they must register it. They can buy a gun for personal protection, but they must show that they face an imminent threat and that police protection is not good enough. In a previous fact-check, a researcher at the study center in Geneva told us that Australia, Japan, Singapore, South Africa and the United Kingdom have some of the strictest gun regulations. Comparing gun violence The studies we found measured gun violence in terms of the rate of firearm-related homicides. By that standard, America ranks worst among every country of comparable economic status. David Hemenway at Harvard’s School of Public Health has looked at gun deaths across nations. ""If we look at high-income countries, the weakest gun control laws are in the United States, and we have by far the most gun violence,"" Hemenway said. ""At the other extreme are the U.K. and Japan, which have the strongest gun laws, and they have among the lowest levels of gun violence."" The World Bank provides a list of high-income countries. Based on data from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and reporting by the Guardian, America does top the list for the rate of murder by gun fire with a rate of 2.97 deaths per 100,000. Chile comes next, but Chile is not on the list of wealthy nations with strict gun laws. (The full list is here.) In the wealthy group with strict laws, the data undercut Bolling’s claim. Country Homicide by firearm rate per 100,000 population United States 2.97 Canada 0.51 Australia 0.14 United Kingdom 0.07 Japan 0.01 Source: UNODC, Guardian For the countries that have tougher gun laws but lower wealth than the United States, South Africa has a higher rate of gun violence, 17.03 deaths per 100,000, and Singapore has a lower rate, .02 deaths per 100,000. Our ruling Bolling said that countries with tougher gun laws have more gun violence.  The data show that among countries more like America economically, nations with stricter regulation have much lower rates of gun-related homicides. South Africa has tougher laws but is much poorer, and it is the only exception. Bolling described a pattern that does not exist",False,"September 1, 2015"
"""More Americans have died from guns in the United States since 1968 than on battlefields of all the wars in American history.""","In a column published shortly after the on-air slayings of two TV journalists in southwestern Virginia, the New York Times’ Nicholas Kristof offered some ""data points"" about the pervasiveness of gun violence in the United States. One of them was: ""More Americans have died from guns in the United States since 1968 than on battlefields of all the wars in American history."" That sounded familiar. Really familiar. As it turns out, the web version of Kristof’s column sourced a PolitiFact article from Jan. 18, 2013, that fact-checked commentator Mark Shields’ claim that since 1968, ""more Americans have died from gunfire than died in … all the wars of this country's history."" (Shields used the year 1968 because it was the year presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy was assassinated by gunman Sirhan Sirhan.) We rated the claim True. Two and a half years later, we wondered whether the statistic still held up, so we took a new look at the data. Deaths from warfare We found a comprehensive study of war-related deaths published by the Congressional Research Service on Feb. 26, 2010, and we supplemented that with data for up-to-date deaths in Iraq and Afghanistan using the website icasualties.org. Where possible, we’ve used the broadest definition of ""death"" — that is, all war-related deaths, not just those that occurred in combat. The one change we’ve made since our initial fact-check is to revise upward the number of Civil War deaths. As several readers pointed out after we published our earlier fact-check, the CRS report cited 525,000 Union and Confederate dead, but a subsequent study revised that estimate upward to 750,000. The study’s author acknowledged a great deal of uncertainty about the proper figure, and some experts later questioned whether it’s wise to include so many deaths from disease — perhaps two-thirds of the 750,000 figure — since disease in an era of relatively primitive medicine was so widespread that it’s unclear what share of fatal disease during that period was really a result of the war. Still, we’ll err on the side of the higher estimate and use the 750,000 figure this time. Here’s a summary of deaths by major conflict: War Deaths Revolutionary War 4,435 War of 1812 2,260 Mexican War 13,283 Civil War (Union and Confederate, estimate) 750,000 Spanish-American War 2,446 World War I 116,516 World War II 405,399 Korean War 36,574 Vietnam War 58,220 Persian Gulf War 383 Afghanistan War 2,363 Iraq War 4,492 Other wars (includes Lebanon, Grenada, Panama, Somalia and Haiti) 362 TOTAL 1,396,733 Gunfire deaths As we did in our previous fact-check, we used a conservative estimate of data from a 1994 paper published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to count gun-related deaths from 1968 to 1980. For 1981 through 2013, we used annual data sets from CDC. Finally, for 2014 and the first eight months of 2015, we estimated that the number of gun-related deaths were equal to the rate during the previous three full years for which we have data — 2011 to 2013. Here is a summary. The figures below refer to total deaths caused by firearms:   Years Firearm-related deaths 1968 to 1980 377,000 1981 to 1998 620,525 1999 to 2013 464,033 2014 (estimated based on rate from 2011-2013) 33,183 2015 (estimated based on rate from 2011-2013) 22,122 TOTAL, 1968-2015 1,516,863 So the statistic still holds up: There have been 1,516,863 gun-related deaths since 1968, compared to 1,396,733 cumulative war deaths since the American Revolution. That’s 120,130 more gun deaths than war deaths -- about 9 percent more, or nearly four typical years worth of gun deaths. And that’s using the most generous scholarly estimate of Civil War deaths, the biggest component of American war deaths. We’ll offer some added thoughts for context. These figures refer to all gunfire-related deaths, not just homicides. In fact, homicides represent a minority of gun deaths, with suicides comprising the biggest share. In 2013, according to CDC data, 63 percent of gun-related deaths were from suicides, 33 percent were from homicides, and roughly 1 percent each were from accidents, legal interventions and undetermined causes. There’s a risk in using a statistic like this to decry mass homicides carried out with guns. Using total firearm-related deaths makes the case against guns more dramatic than just using homicides alone. However, in our view, Kristof framed this comparison with care. He mentioned suicides not once but three times in his column, and he referred broadly to the ""unrelenting toll of gun violence,"" not specifically to the toll of gun homicides. Indeed, at one point, Kristof specifically referenced the impact that stricter gun laws can have on gun suicides, writing that in 1996, after a mass shooting in Australia, lawmakers tightened gun laws. ""The firearm suicide rate dropped by half in Australia over the next seven years, and the firearm homicide rate was almost halved,"" according to data published in the Journal of Public Health Policy, Kristof wrote. Finally, we’ll note that Kristof’s wording differed ever so slightly from the claim by Shields that we checked previously. While Shields said that ""more Americans have died from gunfire,"" Kristof wrote that ""more Americans have died from guns."" Some may argue that guns don’t kill people, people do. However, that’s a philosophical judgment and beyond our ability to fact-check. Here, we’ll stick to the numbers, and we find they’re on Kristof’s side. Our ruling Kristof wrote, ""More Americans have died from guns in the United States since 1968 than on battlefields of all the wars in American history."" Even using a significantly higher estimate for Civil War deaths than we did the last time we fact-checked this claim, the comparison still holds up. The number of gun deaths since 1968 — including, as Kristof was careful to note, both homicides and suicides — was higher than war fatalities by roughly 120,000 deaths, or almost four years’ worth of gun deaths in the United States",True,"August 27, 2015"
"The Navy ""is bringing charges against"" a Navy officer who shot at the Chattanooga shooter ""for illegally discharging a firearm on federal property.""","The story about what’s happening to a Navy officer ""will make your blood boil,"" professes a Aug. 1 headline on the blog of former Rep. Allen West, R-Fla., a retired Army lieutenant colonel It stems from the July 16, 2015, shooting in Chattanooga, in which a gunman, Muhammad Abdulazeez, began firing at two military facilities, killing four Marines and a Navy sailor. During the onslaught, the commanding officer at the Navy Operational Support Center in Chattanooga used his personal firearm to fire back at Abdulazeez, according to Navy leaders and the officer himself. While some supporters are circulating a petition to honor the actions of the officer, Lt. Cmdr. Timothy White, West said that the Navy is prosecuting him for using his gun. ""Ladies and gents, resulting from the text message I received yesterday, I can confirm that the United States Navy is bringing charges against Lt. Cmdr. Timothy White for illegally discharging a firearm on federal property,"" West wrote. And West wasn’t the only political figure raising the alarm. Democratic presidential candidate Jim Webb, former secretary of the Navy, also tweeted that he had heard the same thing. ""Navy charging LCDR Tim White w/ a crime for trying to defend our sailors & Marines in #Chattanooga? He deserves a medal, not an indictment,"" Webb tweeted. He later added, ""The charge being considered is illegally discharging a firearm on federal property."" Many readers asked us to look into the claims in West’s blog, which was the source for other posts that proliferated on the Internet. So we took a closer look. Unsubstantiated rumors For the record, the Navy has issued a full denial that they have charged or are planning to charge White with any crime related to the Chattanooga shooting incident, both in posts on Facebook and an interview with PolitiFact. ""I can tell you definitively it’s not true,"" Navy spokesman Lieutenant Junior Grade Johnny Michael told PolitiFact. Michael said an investigation into all aspects of the shooting is under way and is far from finished, so no charges are pending or even being seriously considered at this point. ""(Prosecution) is not in the works. We have no plans to press charges,"" Michael said, declining to speculate further about the course of the investigation. We reached out to White to ask him ourselves, but we didn’t hear back. There are only a handful of media reports on this question, and most of those include a statement from the Navy saying the rumor is false. So how did these rumors start? Webb said on Twitter that he ""confirmed with a defense official."" West’s blog said he considered the charges confirmed when he received a text message from an unidentified person asking if West could meet with White. We reached out to West for clarification. Through a spokesperson at the National Center for Policy Analysis -- a conservative think tank where he is the CEO -- West deferred comment to Navy officials and White’s attorney, though he did not name the attorney. The blog also linked to an article from a conservative website, Western Journalism, that said White could in theory be punished for violating a policy (not a law) that says only certain employees can carry firearms at military sites. The Western Journalism article does not say that White is facing any criminal charges or other punishment. It’s also worth noting a difference between this policy about carrying firearms at a military site and the potential charges that West and Webb said White would face: illegally discharging a weapon on federal property. There is a federal law that says people are not allowed to use or carry weapons on federal facilities. There is an exemption for some members of the military regarding their ability to carry weapons on federal property, though we don’t know if White fell under this exemption. Our ruling West wrote that the Navy ""is bringing charges against"" a Navy officer who shot at the Chattanooga shooter ""for illegally discharging a firearm on federal property."" Certainly no charges were filed at the time West wrote his blog post, and none have been filed to date. To the contrary, the Navy has said that it has ""no plans to press charges,"" and we have found no credible reporting to call the Navy’s official statement into question",False,"August 4, 2015"
"""Obama Makes Huge Move to BAN Social Security Recipients From Owning Guns""","After the shooting in Charleston, S.C., that left nine African-American worshippers dead, President Barack Obama made it clear where he directs the blame. ""Every country has violent, hateful, or mentally unstable people,"" Obama said. ""What’s different is not every country is awash with easily accessible guns."" Though efforts to enact comprehensive gun control legislation through Congress withered amid intense opposition from gun rights supporters, Obama has done what he can to use executive orders to curb access to guns. One potential policy for his administration would have the Social Security Administration share information with the national background check system that is used to conduct background checks of gun purchasers. Adding names from the Social Security list would potentially increase the number of people barred from purchasing a gun. After this possibility emerged, gun-rights advocates reacted quickly and aggressively. ""SPREAD THIS: Obama Makes Huge Move to BAN Social Security Recipients From Owning Guns,"" read the headline in the Conservative Tribune. Breitbart, another conservative website, declared: ""Obama’s Secret Plan to Block Seniors on Social Security from Owning Guns."" Other websites qualified their message by referring to ""some Social Security recipients,"" and some cited a specific figure -- 4.2 million -- as the number of people that would be unable to own guns. We were curious to see how all these claims stacked up, so we dug into the evidence. The background check system Under existing federal law, several factors can prevent someone from buying a gun. Most of these have to do with law enforcement issues, such as a prior felony conviction or a record of domestic abuse. Mental-health issues can be another factor, such as involuntary commitment to a mental institution. The National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS, is supposed to streamline the process of gun purchasing by quickly weeding out those who cannot legally buy a gun. In 36 states or territories, the FBI performs all background checks, whereas the remaining 25 states set up their own state agencies to either conduct full or partial background checks. But such a system is only as good as the databases it’s linked to -- and several analyses have shown that these databases are far from complete. If someone is ineligible to purchase a gun but their information didn’t get into the right database, then the background check won’t stop the purchase. For instance, suspected Charleston shooter Dylann Roof should have been ineligible to buy a gun because of a prior felony on a drug charge, but errors in paperwork, and a mistake by the FBI examiner in charge of the background check, meant that Roof passed the check. The Los Angeles Times article The source that every site we found linked back to was a July 18 Los Angeles Times article, headlined, ""Obama pushes to extend gun background checks to Social Security."" The article reports that the Social Security Administration is crafting a new policy that would prevent gun purchases by certain types of beneficiaries. The ineligible beneficiaries would be those who were deemed mentally incompetent. In this instance, a mentally incompetent person would be categorized as someone who has their finances handled by another party, known as a ""representative payee."" The Social Security change did not emerge suddenly. It stems from an executive order by Obama in January 2013 that required ""require federal agencies to make data available to the federal background check system."" The idea behind the executive order was to make the background check database more complete and prevent gun purchases by people who, under the law, are ineligible. We found several problems with the websites’ claims. • The new policy would not ban all Social Security recipients from owning guns. Rather, it would only affect the small fraction who are deemed mentally incompetent, and who are thus are barred from purchasing guns under the law. • The policy is not yet in force. When we reached out to the Social Security Administration, a spokesman responded, ""We are still developing our policy."" In developing the plan, the Social Security Administration is following the lead of another federal agency, the Veterans Administration, which is already sharing names with the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. The Social Security Administration’s policy is expected to be similar. • The policy would not take away guns from people who already own them. There is no indication that this policy would take guns away from people who already own guns. Rather, the policy would affect the ability of some mentally incompetent people from buying new guns. ""There is nothing in the policy that would change the definition of who may possess a gun, nor anything that extends the federal government’s authority to take guns away from those who already have them,"" said Gary Kleck, a professor of criminology at Florida State University. There is one exception to this: California currently tracks and disarms ineligible gun owners. In addition to seizing the guns of those people determined to be mentally unstable, California law enforcement also disarms people with felonies or a domestic violence restraining order. The new policy, once it’s instituted, could marginally increase the number of mentally incompetent individuals living in California who are disarmed under that 2013 law. What about the charge that 4.2 million people would be affected by the policy? There’s some truth to it, but there’s an important caveat: 2.7 million of the beneficiaries who have their finances managed by others receive Social Security because of a mental disability, not just because of their age, according to LaVenia LaVelle, a spokeswoman for the Social Security Administration. So it’s not really accurate to say, as Breitbart did, that the plan is ""to block seniors"" from buying guns, since a large number of those affected would not be seniors. Data from December 2013 shows that about 1.2 million disabled workers with mental disorders who were receiving Social Security disability were under 50.  Finally, some of these people may already be in the database for another reason.  Our ruling Bloggers such as the Conservative Tribune wrote headlines like this one: ""SPREAD THIS: Obama Makes Huge Move to BAN Social Security Recipients From Owning Guns."" This is a vast exaggeration of the actual policy under consideration. It would not affect all Social Security recipients, but rather those who have already been declared mentally incompetent, and thus ineligible under current law from purchasing a gun. And it is targeted at blocking gun purchases, not taking away guns from people who already have them. Only in California could the policy lead to increased gun seizures, and only -- potentially -- for mentally incompetent residents of the state who would be newly added to the background check database.  Obama has not made a sweeping move to disarm gun-owning senior citizens, as these websites claim",False,"July 30, 2015"
"""A law was passed, apparently in the Clinton administration, about whether, in recruiting offices … Marines or other military should be able to have guns. Apparently it is prohibited.""","A day after the shooting rampage at two military sites in Chattanooga that would ultimately take the lives of four Marines and a Navy petty officer, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush -- a Republican presidential candidate -- pointed the finger at former President Bill Clinton’s administration for a law that he said banned the carrying of guns by military recruiters. The shootings took place at two sites -- a military recruiting office in a strip mall and a Navy Operational Support Center. The gunman -- Mohammad Youssef Abdulazeez, 24, a native of Kuwait who had lived in Tennessee for most of his life -- was shot dead by police. Authorities are investigating the killings but haven’t yet confirmed a terrorist motive. Speaking at a Carson City, Nev., town hall on July 17, Bush said, ""A law was passed, apparently in the Clinton administration, about whether, in recruiting offices … Marines or other military should be able to have guns. Apparently it is prohibited."" Bush was one of several Republican candidates to call for an end to such a gun prohibition. Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, another GOP presidential candidate, also pointed blame at Clinton. Bush’s claim raised two questions for us: Are guns prohibited at recruiting offices? And if so, is that due to a law passed under President Clinton? Policies about guns and the military As it turns out, there is a policy that’s relevant here -- but it’s not as straightforward as Bush suggests, and it wasn’t written under Clinton. It stemmed from an effort under Bush’s father, then-President George H.W. Bush. In 1992, when Bush was president, the Department of Defense issued a directive related to firearms for military personnel. That directive replaced an earlier one from 1986. The directive doesn’t specifically address recruiting offices, but it applies broadly to military sites. The 1992 directive, signed by then-Deputy Secretary of Defense Donald Atwood, didn’t outright ban military personnel from carrying weapons. Instead, it said that only certain employees could carry weapons, including those who worked in law enforcement, security and prisons. The directive also did not apply in certain situations, such as in war zones. The policy explains that the intent is ""to limit and control the carrying of firearms by DoD military and civilian personnel."" So the policy did cover most military personnel. Those who have opposed this policy have sometimes referred to it as a Clinton-era policy because the Army did release a regulation that implemented the Defense Department directive in March 1993, two months after Clinton took office. (For more on a similar claim that circulated after a mass shooting at the Washington, D.C., Navy Yard, see the fact-checking website Snopes.) A new Defense Department directive issued in April 2011 after a mass shooting at Ft. Hood in Texas tweaked the policy with some new phrases, including that workers have an ""inherent right to self-defense."" However, the overall policy essentially remained the same. Here is part of that directive: ""Arming DoD personnel (i.e., administrative, assessment, or inspection, not regularly engaged in or directly supervising security or law enforcement activities) shall be limited to missions or threats and the immediate need to protect DoD assets or persons’ lives. DoD Components have the discretion to keep designated staff personnel qualified and available or on call to perform duties."" The recruiting office where the shooting occurred represented all four branches of the military. We could not reach a spokesperson for the Marines. However Brian Lepley, a spokesman for U.S. Army Recruiting Command, said that ""weapons are not permitted in recruiting stations by DoD because there are no law enforcement personnel there."" Many on the Internet noted the gun-free sign on the military recruiting office door. ""Once you cross that door, you are not allowed to have a weapon in there,"" Lepley said. The president’s role So should we blame Clinton -- or any president -- for the Department of Defense directive? ""No, I wouldn’t,"" said Richard Brennan, a senior political scientist at the RAND Corporation and a career Army officer. ""And frankly I’m unaware of any statute that prevents military personnel from carrying weapons. What there has been at least since 1975 when I was a cadet were policies and regulations that govern the circumstances under which military personnel can carry weapons."" Over the years, those policies have consistently said that personnel working as law enforcement and protecting life or federal property can carry firearms. ""There hasn’t been marked change in this,"" he said. While a president could get involved in this level of detail if they wanted to, this is generally settled at a lower pay grade. Such directives are ""internally generated by a need seen either within civilian military leadership or military leadership,"" Brennan said. Typically, they update earlier policies, he added. Steven Bucci, a military expert for the Heritage Foundation and former Army colonel, told PolitiFact that the policy about firearms existed for decades before Clinton, or Bush for that matter. ""As far back as when I joined the military in 1973, and probably further back, you have never been able to carry firearms, privately owned or government, on military installations. You always had to register it with the MP's and keep them locked in the arms rooms,"" he said, referring to military police. Bucci has disputed previous claims that President Clinton ""disarmed"" the military. ""No one ‘disarmed’ the military -- the military itself prefers to manage good order and discipline by not having everyone armed,"" he told PolitiFact. In the wake of the shooting rampage in Tennessee, several lawmakers have said they plan to introduce bills to get rid of the military directive about firearms. Then-Rep. Steve Stockman, R-Texas, introduced a bill in 2013 to repeal the Defense Department directive and prohibit the military from instituting any restrictions on guns. But it never received a vote. We sent a summary of our findings about the defense directives to a spokeswoman for Bush. She reiterated his viewpoint. ""The Clinton administration implemented this policy to prohibit guns in military recruitment offices,"" said Allie Brandenburger. ""Gov. Bush believes military recruiters should be allowed to carry guns."" Our ruling Bush said that ""a law was passed, apparently in the Clinton administration, about whether, in recruiting offices … Marines or other military should be able to have guns. Apparently it is prohibited."" The Department of Defense issued a directive, not a law, in 1992 -- when Bush’s father was president. It did not ban firearms outright; it limited them to military personnel who held certain jobs, such as positions in law enforcement. And while the Army issued a regulation implementing that directive in 1993 -- two months after Clinton was in office -- experts say it is not the sort of matter that would typically rise to the attention of a president. Bush has a point that, for the most part, military personnel can’t have firearms at recruiting offices. But most of everything else he said was incorrect",Mostly False,"July 21, 2015"
"""Bernie Sanders voted against the Brady Bill -- background checks and waiting periods.""","As hype around Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders grows, political opponents and media reporters are once again suggesting the socialist Vermont senator is a gun nut. ""One issue your Democratic rivals are starting to hit you with is the fact that you have, in the past, sided with the NRA on some gun issues,"" CNN’s Jake Tapper said in a July 5 interview with Sanders, alluding to an attack ad paid for by a pro-Martin O’Malley group. ""Bernie Sanders voted against the Brady Bill -- background checks and waiting periods,"" said the attack, which first aired June 25. ""Bernie Sanders is no progressive when it comes to guns."" Sanders’ record on guns has been the subject of liberal ire (""Bernie Sanders, gun nut"") as well as conservative glee (""Sorry liberals, Bernie Sanders is a gun nut""). So we wanted to take a look at his vote on the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, a landmark piece of gun control legislation. The Brady Act mandated that everyone who wanted to buy a handgun had to wait five days while local law enforcement ran criminal background checks. (After 1998, the firearm dealers became responsible for conducting the checks.) But before Brady became law, it underwent many transformations. Sanders, elected to the House of Representatives in 1990, voted on it numerous times, virtually almost always in opposition: • In May 1991, Sanders voted against a version that mandated a seven-day waiting period for background checks, but the bill passed in the House.   • The Senate decreased the waiting period to five days and the bill returned to the House. In Nov. 1991, Sanders voted against that version. Though it passed in the House, the Senate didn’t muster enough votes. The Brady bill and its gun control stance remained in limbo during 1992. • After some back and forth, a version of the bill resurfaced that reinstated the five day waiting period. In November 1993, Sanders voted against that version but for an amendment imposing an instant background check instead (seen by some as pointless, as the technology for instant checks didn’t exist at the time). • He also voted against an amendment that would have ended state waiting periods, and for an amendment giving those denied a gun the right to know why. • The final compromise version of the Brady bill --  an interim five-day waiting period while installing an instant background check system -- was passed and signed into law on Nov. 30, 1993. Sanders voted against it.   According to Sanders' campaign manager Jeff Weaver, Sanders’ reason for opposing the Brady bill was two-fold. First, he believed implementing a national waiting period was federal overreach. And second, he was doing his job. ""He wasn't opposed to states having (waiting periods) if they wanted to. The Republicans wanted to repeal waiting periods in states that had them, and Bernie voted that down,"" Weaver said. ""He said he would be against waiting periods, and he kept his word to the people of Vermont."" In April 1991, Sanders’ then-chief of staff Anthony Pollina echoed the idea that Sanders was simply representing the will of his constituents. ""Bernie’s response is that he doesn’t just represent liberals and progressives. He was sent to Washington to present all of Vermont,"" Pollina said. ""It’s not inappropriate for a congressman to support a majority position, particularly on something Vermonters have been very clear about."" The Green Mountain State, though left-leaning, has a high gun ownership rate and lax gun control laws (as well as a low homicide rate). That and Sanders’ own personal views are reflected in his overall voting record, experts told us. ""As a rural state with a large number of hunters and other gun owners, Vermont has been less liberal on guns than on most other issues, historically,"" explained Bertram Johnson, a professor of political science at Middlebury College in Vermont. ""He seems to support more regulation of guns than the U.S. presently has, but he recognizes his constituents’ preferences so does not make gun control a priority."" ""I think he has disappointed many progressives in Vermont with his gun positions, which sort of walk a middle line – and angering both sides through the years,"" said Chris Graff, the former Vermont Associated Press bureau chief. ""Gun control is a tough issue in Vermont for all politicians."" Former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, whose 2004 presidential bid is often compared to Sanders’ 2016 run, received high marks from the National Rifle Association. Vermont Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy also voted against the Brady bill. For his part, Sanders has voted to tighten gun control about half the time, and to protect Second Amendment rights the other half. Here are his votes on key gun bills in his 25 years in Congress (bold reflects a pro-gun control position): Year Legislation Sanders’ Vote Result 1993 Imposes a five-day waiting period and background checks on firearm purchases, part of the Brady Bill Nay Passed 1993 Imposes instant background checks instead for firearm purchases, part of an amendment to Brady Bill Yea Passed 1993 Imposes an interim five-day waiting period while while waiting to put a instant background check system in place, part of Brady Bill conference report Nay Passed 1994 Bans semi-automatic assault weapons  Yea Passed 1996 Repeals the semi-automatic weapons ban  Nay Passed 1998 Increases minimum sentencing for gun crimes Yea Passed 1999 Creates ""instant check registrants"" and narrowly defines ""gun shows,"" part of the Mandatory Gun Show Background Check Act Nay Failed 1999 Imposes three day waiting period for guns purchased at gun shows, part of an amendment to the Gun Show Act Yea Failed 2002 Allows pilots and flight personnel to carry firearms in the cockpit Yea Passed 2003 Prohibits lawsuits against firearm makers for unlawful misuse of a firearm Yea Passed 2005 Prohibits lawsuits against firearm makers for unlawful misuse of a firearm Yea Passed 2006 Prohibits funds from being used to enforce trigger locks on guns Nay Passed 2006 Increases the burden of proof for the AFT to penalize law-breaking gun dealers, as part of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms reform bill Yea Passed 2007 Prohibits foreign aid funding restrictions on U.S. gun ownership, as an amendment to the Consolidated Appropriations Act 2008 Yea Passed 2008 Prevents the use of funds for anti-gun programs as an amendment to the Indian Health Care Improvement Act Yea Passed 2009 Gives the District of Columbia seats in the House of Representatives and repeals the district’s ban on semi-automatic weapons Yea Passed 2009 Allows the use of firearms in National Parks Yea Passed 2009 Allows concealed and carry across state lines Nay Failed 2009 Allows firearms in checked baggage on Amtrak trains, as an amendment to the congressional budget Yea Passed 2009 Prohibits higher insurance premiums for gun owners, as part of an amendment to the Affordable Care Act Yea Passed 2013 Prevents the U.S. from entering the United Nations Arms Trade Treaty, as an amendment to the congressional budget Nay Passed 2013 Allows concealed and carry across state lines in states where the practice is not prohibited Nay Failed 2013 Lists all people prohibited buying a firearm in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System Yea Failed 2013 Bans high-capacity ammunition magazines carrying more than 10 rounds Yea Failed 2013 Bans assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines Yea Failed Sanders’ moderate stance is noted by firearm enthusiasts and gun control advocates alike. Former NRA research coordinator Paul Blackman says the group doesn’t consider Sanders ""an anti-gunner,"" and he’s received mixed marks from NRA ranging from a C-  to F.

"""The United States doesn’t have the highest murder rate among developed countries. You look at Russia, you look at Brazil, those are countries that have 3 to 5 times higher murder rates than what we have here in the United States.""","Following the mass shooting in Charleston, S.C., President Barack Obama claimed that ""mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries. It doesn’t happen in other places with this kind of frequency."" PolitiFact rated that claim Mostly False. The next day, Obama slightly altered his wording to make his claim more accurate. During a meeting of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, Obama said that ""you don’t see murder on this kind of scale, this kind of frequency in any other advanced nation on Earth."" Still, Obama’s words were not without criticism. We flagged one claim from John R. Lott, Jr., founder of the Crime Prevention Research Center, a pro-gun research group. ""The thing that most disappoints me with regard to the president is he just keeps on putting out information that is clearly false,"" Lott said on Fox News June 24, 2015. ""I mean, in the clip that you had, the United States doesn’t have the highest murder rate among developed countries. ""You look at Russia, you look at Brazil, those are countries that have 3 to 5 times higher murder rates than what we have here in the United States. There are other countries which are similar to us."" PunditFact decided to take a closer look at his claim. We found Lott referenced the same information in an article published in the New York Daily News that same day. ""Among developed countries … the U.S. isn’t anywhere close to having the highest homicide rate. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the arbiter of which countries are considered industrialized, ranks Russia and Brazil far ahead of the U.S., with homicide rates that are respectively 2 1/2 to five times higher than ours. Our rate was tied with Chile’s, and just slightly above the average for developed countries."" Lott’s claim has a couple areas worthy of fact checking. First of all, do Russia’s and Brazil’s crime rates match what Lott said? And second, are Russia and Brazil even considered to be developed countries as Lott seems to indicate? Just the numbers PunditFact reached out to Lott for more information about his claim. Lott cited data gathered by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). According to the report (which includes statistics for 2011, the latest available year), the United States has a homicide rate of 5.2 murders per 100,000 inhabitants. Comparatively, Russia has a homicide rate of 12.8 murders, and Brazil has a rate of 25.5 murders. With these numbers, Russia’s rate comes out to be 2.46 times greater than that of the United States, and Brazil’s murder rate comes out to be 4.90 times larger than that of the United States. Lott mentioned Chile in his op-ed in the Daily News. That country’s murder rate is 4.4 murders per 100,000 inhabitants, which is actually less than the rate of the United States. Other sources largely support the OECD research, and Lott’s use of the numbers. According to the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime’s study, in 2011 the United States had a homicide rate of 4.7 murders per 100,000 people, Russia’s murder rate was 9.6 per 100,000 people and Brazil’s rate was 23.4. According to this data, Russia’s murder rate was 2.04 times higher than that of the United States, and Brazil’s was 4.97 times greater. That’s close to what Lott said. Developed or Developing? Now comes the trickier part of Lott’s claim. Lott was reacting to Obama’s use of the word ""advanced"" to describe a group of countries, and saying Obama was providing false information. Lott described a group of counties with the word ""developed"" and included Brazil and Russia. Those words are important, and whether you consider Brazil or Russia advanced and/or developed makes all the difference. The OECD is currently comprised of 34 member countries and lists Brazil and Russia as ""key partners."" But just because the OECD includes these 36 countries when compiling its Better Life Index does not mean that they are all automatically classified as developed nations. The OECD’s member countries ""include many of the world’s most advanced countries but also emerging countries like Mexico, Chile and Turkey."" PunditFact reached out to OECD’s Better Life Index to inquire what criteria was used to distinguish between ‘developed’ and ‘developing’ countries, but did not hear back. However, other experts shed some light on the issue. According to Massimo Morelli, Columbia University professor of political science and economics, Brazil and Russia are considered intermediate countries. They are not ""developing"" nations, but not quite considered ""advanced/developed,"" either. ""The so-called BRIC countries  (Brazil, Russia, India and China) are those who moved from developing to developed very fast due to fast growth rates, but they are definitely not advanced yet,"" Morelli said. However, he did note that out of the four intermediate countries, both Russia and China may be considered advanced in some respects. Leonid Peisakhin, assistant professor of politics at New York University in Abu Dhabi, agreed. ""There is no hard definition for what an advanced country is. There are different markers having to do with human development levels, levels of industrialization, income per capita, size of the services sector, etc. Russia is a tricky case, as it is, in fact, highly industrialized; however, Russia does not have very high income or human development levels. Brazil is less ambiguously a developing economy,"" he said. However, even some of these factors are not always clear cut. ""If you define ‘advanced’ countries based on something simple such as per capita real GDP, I think that you are going to have a hard time including countries such as Chile, Poland, Greece, Portugal, and many others, but not include Russia,"" Lott said in a follow-up statement to PunditFact. The World Bank uses GNI (Gross National Income), and not GDP, as its prime indicator. (The total national income is divided by the population of the country to determine the GNI per capita.) In 2013, Brazil’s GNI per capita was $11,690. Russia’s was $13,850. Using the World Bank definition, Brazil is classified as having an upper-middle-income economy, which places it under the category of a developing nation. Russia is ranked as a high-income nation, and is not labeled as ""developing."" For comparison the U.S. GNI in 2013 was $53,470. Meanwhile, the World Trade Organization allows members to decide for themselves how to classify themselves, although other member countries can dispute the decision. ""Setting aside these ambiguities, there can be no doubt that the U.S. should be compared to other countries with similar levels of income and development and a similar historical trajectory: Western Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. These are all highly advanced and developed economies with similar historical trajectories and consequently functional rule of law systems,"" said Peisakhin. One final note: Out of the nations observed, the United States’ murder rate was only exceeded by three countries in the study: Brazil, Russia, and Mexico. (Mexico is considered emerging or developing by most organizations, including OECD.) Our ruling Lott said that the ""United States doesn’t have the highest murder rate among developed countries. You look at Russia, you look at Brazil, those are countries that have 3 to 5 times higher murder rates than what we have here in the United States."" Although the specific murder rates vary across different sources, Lott’s statement about Russia’s and Brazil’s murder rates did match up with the information the OECD had. What didn’t quite match up was the consensus on how to classify Brazil and Russia. They are advanced on some fronts, especially Russia, but not as developed as others. Ultimately, they may not be the best choice when comparing murder rates in the United States and other ""developed"" nations. Lott’s statement is partially accurate",Half True,"June 30, 2015"
"""Two weeks ago, a man entered the world’s busiest airport in Atlanta, Georgia, carrying a loaded AR-15 automatic weapon with an extended-capacity, 100-round magazine.""","When Jim Cooley carried his AR-15 rifle fully loaded with a 100-round drum into Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport last month, it revived a Georgia congressman’s efforts to restrict weapons in airports nationwide. U.S. Rep. Hank Johnson, D-Lithonia, cited the incident in again proposing the Airport Security Act, which would ban loaded weapons outside airports’ security areas. Federal law already bans carrying weapons through airport security checkpoints. ""Two weeks ago, a man entered the world’s busiest airport in Atlanta, Georgia, carrying a loaded AR-15 automatic weapon with an extended capacity, 100-round magazine,"" Johnson said in a House floor speech June 15. ""Mr. Speaker, actions like this, which follow shootings at airports in Los Angeles and Houston, undermine public security in the same way as yelling ‘fire’ in a crowded theater."" Johnson’s proposal has been assigned to the House Homeland Security Committee, where the political battle over gun control will continue. But something in the rhetoric caught our eye for a closer look. Was the rifle in question at our airport an automatic weapon? THE HISTORY The AR-15 that Cooley carried is most likely the most popular such rifle on the market today. That is in part because several variants have been made since Colt started selling its version of the rifle as a semi-automatic weapon to civilians in the early 1960s. One modified version of the firearm was adopted as the M-16 rifle, deployed by the U.S. Army during the Vietnam War era. Several different manufacturers have since made versions of the rifle for private use. But the term ""AR-15"" has consistently been used to refer to the semi-automatic version Colt made popular. A fully automatic version is not sold directly to civilians. The federal assault weapons ban prohibited some versions of the AR-15 – such as those with collapsible stocks and bayonet lug – sold to civilians between 1994 and 2004. However, AR-15s built before the ban were legal – as were versions designed to comply with the federal law. Those loopholes effectively kept various forms of the AR-15 in production. For instance, admitted movie theater shooter James Holmes used a version of the AR-15 in the Aurora, Colo., massacre in 2012 that would have been illegal under the federal ban. But similar versions, including the Colt Match Target rifle, would have been legal, according to a 2004 University of Pennsylvania study funded by the National Institute of Justice. AUTOMATIC VERSUS SEMI-AUTOMATIC So, it’s clear the rifles can be deadly. In fact, semi-automatic weapons are often more deadly than the scarier sounding automatic versions, said Jay Corzine, a sociology professor at the University of Central Florida. That boils down to the difference between the two: Automatic weapons fire continuously when the shooter pulls the trigger once. The firing stops only when you release the trigger. Semi-automatic weapons will automatically reload, but the shooter must pull the trigger for each shot fired. Many law enforcement agencies that use small arms rifles, such as for SWAT teams, prefer semi-automatic weapons because there is less recoil in firing them. That allows for better aim, Corzine said. Nearly all AR-15 rifles are manufactured as semi-automatic weapons, in part because of that accuracy. However, gun shops do sell converter kits and manuals, which allow the rifles to be turned into automatic weapons that wouldn’t differ at a glance from the semi-automatic version, Corzine said. ""An automatic firing mechanism is not more lethal in number of people killed, but you will end up with more people hit,"" Corzine said. ""If you are shooting into a crowd, you’re going to hit a lot of people."" IN GEORGIA The 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting that killed 26 children and school staff prompted Connecticut, Maryland and New York to join three other states with heavy restrictions or outright bans on the AR-15. But Georgia is not one of the states with restrictions. Likewise, Cooley was legally able to sling his AR-15 over his chest because of a 2010 state law that allows weapons in areas not covered by airport security. Cooley, who lives in Winder, said he brought his gun and the high-capacity magazine for safety when dropping off his daughter for a flight. His weapon, he said, is a semi-automatic rifle. ""If you look at the video, the officer called my rifle an automatic weapon, and I had to correct her,"" said Cooley, who posted a video of his visit to the airport while carrying the weapon. ""It is a semi-automatic rifle. To say it’s not is untrue. You can’t just say anything you want on the House floor."" In his floor statements, Johnson cited the economic role that airports, especially Hartsfield-Jackson, play in communities as a reason to regulate guns for safety concerns. Johnson was at meetings in the United Nations when we reached out to him. Ben Waldon, his director of intergovernmental affairs, told us the congressman concedes he misspoke in calling Cooley’s weapon an automatic rather than a semi-automatic weapon. Waldon added that the 100-round drum also was a concern, regardless of the status of the weapon. Studies indicate limiting high-capacity magazines can affect gun violence since they are involved in more crimes (about 25 percent) than automatic and semi-automatic weapons (2 percent to 8 percent). Small-capacity magazines require the shooter to reload, which gives bystanders a chance to intervene as they did in the 2011 shooting of U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords that killed six. ""Mr. Cooley’s weapon was a semi-automatic. But it is an assault rifle, with a high-capacity magazine,"" Waldon said. ""The congressman feels these kinds of weapons stoke fear, not civility, and the incident in Atlanta demonstrates the extremes of allowing these kinds of guns in airports."" OUR RULING U.S. Rep. Hank Johnson cited a recent incident of a man carrying his AR-15 rifle in Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport in reviving his efforts to ban weapons from all areas of airports. Johnson called the gun an ""automatic weapon,"" something he and his staff concede was incorrect. The gun owner has confirmed he owns the semi-automatic version of the rifle. That is the more common make of this weapon, although all sides and experts acknowledge the weapon can be converted to an automatic weapon. The bigger concern was the 100-magazine drum. Even in a semi-automatic weapon, that would allow a shooter to fire 100 rounds before reloading, the scary prospect that Johnson appeared to want to reference in his statement. Johnson got the gun wrong, the magazine for the weapon right",Half True,"June 23, 2015"
"""Here are the stats: Per population, we kill each other with guns at a rate 297x more than Japan, 49x more than France, 33x more than Israel.""","Ever since nine people were killed by a gunman at a historic African-American church in Charleston, S.C., President Barack Obama has taken to various forums to discuss the issue of gun violence in the United States. In a tweet sent from his @POTUS account on June 20, 2015 -- three days after the killings -- Obama said, ""Here are the stats: Per population, we kill each other with guns at a rate 297x more than Japan, 49x more than France, 33x more than Israel."" The tweet clearly struck a nerve; within the first three days, Obama’s message was retweeted almost 40,000 times and favorited almost 30,000 times. The data appear to come from a credible source, a study by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. The Guardian, a British newspaper, used raw data from that U.N. report to create a streamlined, country-by-country table showing selected measurements. One of the metrics included in that table was homicide rate by firearm per 100,000 population. Here are the rates for the four countries Obama cited, according to the Guardian: United States: 2.97 per 100,000 Japan: 0.01 per 100,000 France: 0.06 per 100,000 Israel: 0.09 per 100,000 Using this data, the United States has a rate 297 times higher than Japan, 49.5 times higher than France and 33 times higher than Israel -- precisely as Obama said. We will note a few caveats, all of them common for this kind of claim. The data is a bit old. It's from 2007 (for the United States, France and Israel) and 2008 (for Japan). The data is not ideally standardized. The data is culled from various international sources that have different standards and degrees of quality control. There is at least one different data set. A website produced by the University of Sydney in Australia, gunpolicy.org, has data from the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that is slightly different. The ratio was 3.4 times higher than Israel in 2011, and almost 18 times higher for France in 2010. (Japan can't be easily calculated because its rate approaches zero.) Still, the broad patterns held. David Hemenway, a professor of health policy at the Harvard School of Public Health, urged caution in making international comparisons, but he added that Obama seems to use the available data responsibly. ""The exact numbers change every year and can change a fair amount since the number of homicides from these other countries are so low each year,"" he said. Still, he added, ""the story the data tell is largely the same whichever source or year is used."" Our ruling Obama tweeted, ""Here are the stats: Per population, we kill each other with guns at a rate 297x more than Japan, 49x more than France, 33x more than Israel."" It’s always worth being cautious of international comparisons of crime statistics, given technical limitations with the data. But even if some data sources produce different numbers than the ones Obama cited, the general pattern is the same -- the United States has firearm homicide rates many times higher than those in the three countries mentioned",Mostly True,"June 22, 2015"
"""This type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries. It doesn’t happen in other places with this kind of frequency.""","After a gunman shot and killed nine worshippers in a historic African-American church in Charleston, S.C., President Barack Obama took to the White House podium the next day to ""express our deep sorrow over the senseless murders."" In his June 18, 2015, remarks from the White House, Obama said, ""Now is the time for mourning and for healing. But let’s be clear: At some point, we as a country will have to reckon with the fact that this type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries. It doesn’t happen in other places with this kind of frequency. And it is in our power to do something about it."" A flurry of PolitiFact readers -- some of them prompted by articles objecting to Obama’s claim -- wrote to us to ask us to check it, so we did. An important point to make right off the bat is that many of the critics have pointed to the first part of Obama’s claim -- that ""this type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries."" As we’ll explain, the critics have a point here -- mass violence, including mass shootings, happen in a wide variety of countries. However, the critics have truncated the quotation, leaving off the next sentence -- that ""it doesn’t happen in other places with this kind of frequency."" That’s also not fully correct, but it’s not quite as wrong as the first claim. The White House argues that Obama's second sentence qualifies the first, and added that PunditFact rated Mostly True the claim that ""Americans are 20 times as likely to die from gun violence as citizens of other civilized countries."" However, that claim refers to gun violence generally, not mass killings specifically, the topic of Obama's comment. For a look at the statistics, we checked with two researchers, Jaclyn Schildkraut of the State University of New York in Oswego and H. Jaymi Elsass of Texas State University. They have been collecting and analyzing mass-shooting incidents in 11 countries, covering the period from 2000 to 2014. Aside from the United States, the countries they studied are Australia, Canada, China, England, Finland, France, Germany, Mexico, Norway and Switzerland. (They also looked at less-developed countries, but we will exclude those since Obama specifically mentioned ""advanced"" countries.) Schildkraut and Elsass shared the summary information from their database with PolitiFact. Here’s their table:  The chart does show that the United States has more mass shootings -- and more people cumulatively killed or injured -- than the other 10 nations combined, partly because it has a much bigger population than all but China. Still, using this data, it’s easy to dispense with the first claim Obama made -- that ""this type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries."" Over the decade and a half studied, the researchers found 23 incidents of mass shootings in the other 10 countries, resulting in 200 dead and 231 wounded. In the United States over the same period, there were 133 incidents that left 487 dead and 505 wounded. Here are a just a few examples of mass shootings in other countries: • On July 22, 2011, a total of 80 people were killed in Norway when Anders Behring Breivik, a political extremist, bombed a government building in Oslo and then went on a shooting rampage on the island of Utoya, just outside the city. • On March 11, 2009, in Winnenden, Germany, a teenage gunman killed 15 people. The majority of the victims were children and teachers killed when the shooter opened fire in three classrooms in a local secondary school. The gunman shot two other people before killing himself after being cornered by the local police. • On Sept. 23, 2008, in Kuahajoki, Finland, a gunman shot 10 people to death after opening fire on a classroom in the Kuahajoki School of Hospitality. After killing the students, the shooter burned the victims’ bodies. In sum, then, Obama is wrong to say that ""this type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries."" Clearly it does happen elsewhere, and not in trivial numbers. Seven of the countries saw double-digit numbers of people killed in mass shootings during that period. By contrast, the second part of Obama’s claim -- that ""it doesn’t happen in other places with this kind of frequency"" -- isn’t entirely off-base. We compared mass shooting incidents across countries is to calculate the number of victims per capita -- that is, adjusted for the country’s total population size. Calculating it this way shows the United States in the upper half of the list of 11 countries, ranking higher than Australia, Canada, China, England, France, Germany and Mexico. Still, the U.S. doesn’t rank No. 1. At 0.15 mass shooting fatalities per 100,000 people, the U.S. had a lower rate than Norway (1.3 per 100,000), Finland (0.34 per 100,000) and Switzerland (1.7 per 100,000). We’ll note that all of these countries had one or two particularly big attacks and have relatively small populations, which have pushed up their per-capita rates. In Norway, that single attack in 2011 left 67 dead by gunfire (plus additional bomb casualties). Finland had two attacks, one that killed eight and one that killed 10. And Switzerland had one incident that killed 14. Still, while the United States did rank in the top one-third of the list, the fact that three other countries exceeded the United States using this method of comparison does weaken Obama’s claim that ""it doesn’t happen in other places with this kind of frequency."" In at least three countries, the data shows, it does. Elsass warned PolitiFact of a few caveats about the data. While they believe their database ""to be among the most exhaustive compilations available,"" Elsass noted that it may not include every instance of mass shootings. It also doesn’t include every example of mass killings -- just those committed by firearms, even though mass stabbings are not uncommon in such places as China. Finally, their database doesn’t include acts generally considered to be terrorism, such as the attack in Paris on the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. ""If these were included, we are likely to see something much different statistically as there have been a number of very high-profile terrorist attacks in Europe, some including the use of firearms, that are excluded from the current analysis,"" she said. But in all likelihood, this would only make the case against Obama’s claim stronger. The bottom line is that it’s unwise to take these numbers as gospel -- but the figures from this database are clear enough to cast significant doubt on the accuracy of the specific claim Obama made.

It doesn’t happen in other places with this kind of frequency."" The data shows that it clearly happens in other countries, and in at least three of them, there’s evidence that the rate of killings in mass-shooting events occurred at a higher per-capita rate than in the United States between 2000 and 2014.

Ninety-seven percent of Americans do not receive subsidies for health care under the Affordable Care Act.,"(Editor's note: An earlier version of this fact-check included an incorrect number for the $1.7 billion in monthly tax credits potentially at risk for 6.4 million people in Georgia and 33 other states in the lawsuit King v. Burwell.)   The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to rule later this month in a lawsuit that could wipe out premium subsidies for millions of Americans under President Barack Obama’s healthcare law.   About 6.4 million people in Georgia and 33 other states who use the federal marketplace could be at risk of losing a total of $1.7 billion in monthly tax credits and face net premium increases of 287 percent, according to a state-by-state analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation.   Many in the GOP, particularly Tea Party Republicans, are likely to resist extending the subsidies, even temporarily, The Washington Times reported June 5.   Those Republicans are much more worried about angering their base by appearing to concede on Obamacare than they are about having a handful of constituents lose their subsidies, the newspaper said..   ""Ninety-seven percent of Americans aren't receiving those subsidies,"" Georgia Congressman Austin Scott told reporters.   That statistic caught the eye of a PolitiFact reader who asked us to do some checking. ""Is that claim accurate?"" the reader wrote. . We promised to do some checking.   First a little background about the closely watched lawsuit, King v. Burwell.    The plaintiff, King, argues that because the health care law refers to ""an exchange established by the state,"" individuals in states with federally run exchanges are not eligible for subsidies.    Others contend that the clear intent of the ACA  -- the most significant overhaul of U.S.healthcare since passage of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965 --  is to allow individuals to obtain subsidized insurance regardless of whether they obtain it through a state or federal exchange.   Currently, 34 states rely on the federal exchange and could lose subsidies if the Supreme Court rules in favor of King.    Florida could be the most affected, with 1.3 million residents losing monthly subsidies worth a combined $206 million a month, according to forecasts.   In Georgia, 412,385 people could lose subsidies, with a total monthly value of $113 million, the Kaiser Family Foundation analysis showed.   States such California and New York, which set up their own exchanges, would be untouched by the ruling.   So what about Scott’s statement that 97 percent of Americans aren’t receiving ACA insurance subsidies. We reached out to Ryann DuRant, Scott’s communications director.   She told us Scott’s statement was based on calculations that were done using data from the Kaiser Family Foundation analysis, reports in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and population information from the U.S. Census.   This includes: about 6.4 million people who receive federal subsidies to buy insurance;, estimates of all insurance subsidies, state and federal combined,totalling about nine million; the national  population estimate of about 318 million. (We calculated 2.83 percent or just shy or 3 percent with subsidies, leaving about 97 percent of Americans without subsidies)   We asked the Kaiser Family Foundation in D.C.to independently run the numbers for us.   Chris Lee, a communications officer with the foundation, said about 2.7 percent of Americans receive ACA tax credits.    His calculation is based on information that slightly more than 8.6 million of the nation’s 321 million residents have received advance premium tax credits, or subsidies, to buy their insurance, Lee said.   That would mean about 97.3 percent of Americans aren’t receiving subsidies to buy insurance.   DuRant told us Scott is co-sponsoring a bill, introduced June 4, to repeal ObamaCare and ""address healthcare for all Americans.   ""So in no way was this to discount the 3 percent or the 97 percent,"" she said. ‘We are concerned with 100 percent of Americans and with lowering health insurance premiums for 100 percent of Americans.""   The GOP-controlled Congress has repeatedly expressed interest in passing legislation to fully repeal and replace ObamaCare, and Scott’s bill is one of several options that is available.   .Our ruling U.S. Rep. Austin Scott said 97 percent of Americans don’t receive subsidies for health care under the Affordable Care Act. His numbers are close",True,"June 15, 2015"
"""The American murder rate is 50 times that of any other developed nation.""","In 2014, eccentric British comedian Russell Brand launched an Internet video show called The Trews, short for ""true news."" True news! Something PunditFact can get behind. The show usually features Brand offering his opinion on the topics of the day, often about his native England but also sometimes about the United States. In the 327th episode of The Trews, Brand criticizes Fox News pundit Greg Gutfeld for cheering the death sentence for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, convicted for his role in the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings that killed three people and injured scores more. Brand said Gutfeld and other Fox News pundits ignore the prevalence of gun violence in the United States that kills a lot more people, throwing out a slew of statistics to capture his point. ""In a country that has more guns per person than any other country in the world, where the American murder rate is 50 times that of any other developed nation, where women are estimated to be 11 times more likely to be murdered with a gun than women in any other developed country, why does the focus fall on this particular story?"" Brand said. ""Because it’s a story that helps to maintain the order."" Brand’s soliloquy continued after his round of fact-dropping, but the show being called The Trews and all, we were struck by the claim that the U.S. murder rate ""is 50 times that of any other developed nation."" Unfortunately, it’s not Trews. ""Fifty times is ridiculous,"" said James Alan Fox, Northeastern University professor of criminology, law and public policy. ""Fifty times the homicide rate is much too high,"" said David Hemenway, a Harvard School of Public Health professor of health policy who studies gun-homicide rates. ""Maybe it just was hyperbole."" The FBI-estimated homicide rate for the United States in 2013 was 4.6 deaths per 100,000 population. The World Health Organization estimate is a bit higher at 5.4. For our calculations, we’ll use the official and most recent FBI rate of 4.6, though it doesn’t matter either way to debunk Brand’s point. While either estimate is considerably higher than the homicide rate of other Western, high-income countries, it is not remotely as much as Brand suggests. Canada, for example, had a WHO-estimated homicide rate of 1.8 deaths per 100,000 population. So the U.S. rate is a little less than three times higher. The homicide rate in the U.S. was three times higher than the United Kingdom (1.5 per 100,000) and about eight times that of Switzerland (0.6 per 100,000). Compared to Japan (0.9 per 100,000), the U.S. rate is five times higher. We put together a table of of all the developed nations, using the World Bank definition of high-income countries. The reason the United States has such a high homicide rate compared to those countries is tied to the fact that it has more firearms per capita and more permissive gun control laws. A 2003 analysis, while more than a decade old, concluded the U.S. firearm homicide rate was more than 20 times the rate of Australia, France, United Kingdom (except Northern Ireland), Israel, South Korea, Japan, Norway, Poland and Slovenia. (See a related fact-check.) The findings, published in the Journal of Trauma, Injury, Infection and Critical Care, also found that the firearm homicide rate was strikingly larger among American 15-24-year-olds compared to peer countries — 42.7 times bigger, as a matter of fact. That’s closer to the number Brand presented, but it’s not how he presented it. Regardless, experts cautioned against drawing sweeping conclusions about murder rates from country to country. Every nation presents a new set of societal differences, and developing countries in particular have various definitions and methods of counting homicides, said Alan Lizotte, University at Albany professor and dean of the School of Criminal Justice. ""It’s not really good to compare countries to each other without considering the culture,"" he said. The turbulent history of the United States partially explains today’s violent American society, he said, from Western settlers’ hostile encounters with the indigenous population to the haphazard move out west and the underlying history of defending oneself and one’s property. The Canadians, by contrast, were more peaceful as they settled their western territories, sending out mounties to look for new land to inhabit and making peace with the native population first, Lizotte said. ""The main point is when you’re comparing countries, you’re comparing things that don’t compare very well,"" he said. Emails to Brand’s representatives were not returned. Our ruling Brand said, ""The American murder rate is 50 times that of any other developed nation."" Yes, the American homicide rate is pretty bad, at least compared to most of its high-income peers. But it’s not even close to being as bad as Brand suggests. For instance, the homicide rate in the United States is just three times higher than that in the United Kingdom. Brand considerably overstated things",False,"June 2, 2015"
"Says Marco Rubio said that ""felons should not have their voting rights restored"" but that ""convicted felons should be allowed to own guns after they have done their time.""","A Facebook meme suggests that U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., believes convicted felons should regain their right to own a gun but not the right to vote. The meme, sent to us by a reader, presents two quotes purportedly by Rubio. The first, dated March 16, is, ""No, felons should not have their voting rights restored even after they have served their sentence."" The second quote, from May 6, says, ""Of course, convicted felons should be allowed to own guns after they have done their time. It is their constitutional right."" The claim was attributed to the Facebook community group ""Stop the world, the teabaggers want off."" We’ll note right off the bat that the group’s Facebook page cops to being a primarily satirical site. It says, ""This page is for entertainment purposes. It is NOT meant to be taken seriously. It is primarily satire and parody with a mix of political memes and messages."" Still, casual Facebook users are unlikely to see this bit of context and could easily take the quotes in the meme at face value, so we’ll check the substance of the meme anyway. We searched Nexis and Google for the quotes and did not find any instances in which Rubio said those words. (We contacted spokespersons for Rubio and did not get a response. We also tried to contact the ""Teabaggers"" group via Twitter and Facebook but did not hear back.) Felons and voting rights States have the power to decide how -- or whether -- to restore the rights of felons to vote once they have served their time. (Maine and Vermont allow felons to vote while in prison.) In Florida in 2007 under then-Gov. Charlie Crist, the Cabinet agreed to relax the rules to make it easier for felons to regain their civil rights, including the right to vote. The Cabinet set rules for three levels of offenders who could apply to get their rights back, including the requirement that they had to finish their sentences. At the time, Rubio was the speaker of the House, but since the Cabinet set the rules, the Legislature had no official role. When Rubio ran against Crist for a U.S. Senate seat in 2010, he attacked his record on restoration of voting rights. In 2009, Rubio said on Morning Joe that Crist ""restored the rights of felons to vote automatically here in Florida."" The following year, Rubio said Crist ""worked with ACORN and groups like that to give felons voting rights in Florida."" (ACORN, or the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, dissolved in 2010 in the wake of a video sting that showed ACORN employees telling people posing as a pimp and a prostitute how to conceal their criminal activities. The group advocated for increased voter access, but there was no proof that Crist worked with ACORN on his plan to restore voting rights to felons, so we rated that claim False.) In both instances, Rubio clearly sounded like he was criticizing Crist. It’s not a big leap to think that he is personally against allowing felons to regain their right to vote, but his words fall short of making that clear. The issue of restoring voting rights to certain felons has come up in the U.S. Senate the past two years but it hasn’t received a vote, so we don’t know Rubio’s position on it. The Civil Rights Voting Restoration Act of 2015 would allow citizens to vote in any federal election even if they had been convicted of a non-violent criminal offense unless the individual was in jail or on probation. The bipartisan duo of Sen. Rand Paul, a Republican presidential candidate from Kentucky, and Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, are the measure’s co-sponsors. Last year, Paul co-sponsored a similar bill with U.S. Rep. Frederica Wilson, D-Florida. Paul, who has made efforts to court black voters, has said that stripping voting rights from felons is a form of voter suppression and has disproportionately harmed black voters. Felons and gun ownership Under federal law, individuals with felony convictions lose their right to own guns, but states can restore these rights, a 2011 New York Times investigation found. In some states, felons can only regain their right to bear arms if they are pardoned, while others allow certain felons to regain their rights after five to 20 years. In Florida, felons are eligible to apply eight years after the completion of their sentence. But we could not find any statements in which Rubio directly talked about whether convicted felons should be able to regain their right to own a gun. Our ruling A Facebook meme says Rubio said that ""felons should not have their voting rights restored"" but that ""convicted felons should be allowed to own guns after they have done their time."" The meme was posted by a site that describes itself as satirical, and we found no evidence that Rubio actually said the words attributed to him. While Rubio has spoken critically in the past about felons regaining voting rights, he does not appear to have taken a stance on the restoration of felons’ gun rights",False,"May 27, 2015"
"""Once again, a police officer has been killed with an illegal gun from Georgia – a state that last year did the NRA’s bidding and weakened its already lax gun laws.""","The fatal shooting of New York City police officer Brian Moore has the advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety again taking aim at Georgia and its gun laws. ""Once again, a police officer has been killed with an illegal gun from Georgia -- a state that last year did the NRA’s bidding and weakened its already lax gun laws,"" Megan Lewis, the group’s vice president, said in a May 6 press release.. Moore, 25, was shot in the face May 2 and died two days later.  Police took a convicted felon into custody 90 minutes after the shooting and later said the suspect’s weapon was one of 23 guns reported stolen in a break-in at  Little’s Bait, Tackle & Pawn in Perry, south of Macon, in October 2011. Nine of those 23 stolen guns have since turned up at New York crime scenes, including the silver Taurus .38-caliber revolver seized in connection with Moore’s slaying, NYPD officials said. But have there been other police officers killed by illegal guns traced to Georgia as Everytown for Gun Safety’s statement suggests? PolitiFact decided to check. First a little background. Everytown for Gun Safety, an advocacy group founded by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and gun-control advocate Shannon Watts, contends that stolen and illegally trafficked firearms are making their way to cities such as New York from Georgia and other states, especially in the South, that have lax gun laws via the so-called ""iron pipeline."" Erika Soto Lamb, the group’s communications, said Everytown for Gun Safety can back up the statement. As evidence, she pointed to the killings of two NYPD police officers last December in a rampage by a convicted felon. The suspect was using a  gun that was first sold legally by Arrowhead Pawn Shop in Jonesboro, she said. We asked: Is it fair to say that’s ""an illegal gun from Georgia?"" ""The shooter in that event was a convicted felon -- which means he should not have been in possession of a gun and which makes that an illegal gun,"" she wrote in an email.. Tracing and tracking firearms The job of tracing guns falls to the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the only agency authorized to track firearms made in the United States and abroad when law enforcement agencies request help. Police recover guns in various ways – as part of a criminal investigation, during regular patrols and even in buyback events. They can submit requests to the ATF’s National Tracing Center to track a weapon’s history, said ATF Agent Charles J. Mulham, the public information officer for the Bureau’s New York field division. Because a gun’s history can become evidence in a trial, the records are not public unless the requesting agencies disclosing them. The New York Police Department submitted such a request following the shooting of Moore in Queens. It later made the findings public in a press conference. Without required public disclosure of the trace records, the question of whether additional illegal guns from Georgia were used in the shooting deaths of other New York City cops becomes fuzzy to answer. Federal law requires only that guns stolen or lost from licensed gun dealers be reported to the ATF. The District of Columbia and another 10 states – including New York and neighboring New Jersey and Connecticut – require private citizens to report the theft or loss of at least some handguns or weapons. Georgia has no such requirement. That means those who aspire to make money by selling hard-to-come-by firearms in New York City for profit could, in theory, not even bother to steal them in Georgia. They could buy them here, sell them for high mark-ups in New York and, if the trace came back to a legal purchase, possibly face no penalty if they claimed the weapons had been stolen but not reported, Mulham said. In other words, it’s a tricky definition to term a gun ""illegal"" given the patchwork of state laws that govern their purchase. That complicates the definition of the gun used in the December shooting deaths of New York City officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos That gun, a Taurus 9 mm, was bought legally in 1996 from the Jonesboro pawn shop, said NYPD Lt. John Grimpel. The weapon’s history then becomes murky before convicted felon Ismaaiyl Brinsley ended up with it and shot the officers as they sat in their patrol car. It was illegal for Brinsley to have the gun, given restrictions on ownership by felons as well as New York law making it illegal for anyone to have a handgun without a permit. But the gun itself was officially legal because it was legally purchased. That history was uncovered when NYPD requested the gun be traced after the shootings. ""After 1996, the whereabouts of the gun were unknown, until December 2014 when it was used in the murders of officers Ramos and Liu,"" Grimpel said. Our conclusion Police have seized a gun stolen from Georgia nearly four years ago and believe it was used  in the recent, tragic shooting death of a young NYPD officer. But Everytown For Gun Safety overreaches in suggesting that an earlier fatal shooting of two officers involved an ""illegal gun from Georgia."" That weapon was sold according to federal law and therefore legal, until it found its way to someone who used it to commit a horrific crime. Such overreaches allow political debate to shape facts",Mostly False,"May 12, 2015"
"The man who killed a motorist who fatally struck a 2-year-old was ""back on the street"" because he had received a 13-year sentence for bank robbery but only ""served two years.""","Although his department’s primary activity is running two jails and patrolling freeways, not fighting crime on the streets, Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. frequently speaks out nationally on policing, and often in a critical way. Most recently, he made multiple appearances on Fox News to talk about rioting in Baltimore that followed the death of Freddie Gray, a black man who died of a spinal-cord injury that he suffered while in police custody. Clarke blasted Baltimore’s mayor for not responding more forcefully to the violence. Local judges are also a regular target of the sheriff. Addressing Milwaukee crime on the April 26, 2015 edition of ""Upfront with Mike Gousha,"" a show produced by WISN-TV in Milwaukee, Clarke called judges ""the weak link"" in the criminal justice system, saying violent offenders don’t spend enough time behind bars.   As an example, he alluded to Ricky Ricardo Chiles III, a 27-year-old Milwaukee man who shot and killed the driver of a van that killed his 2-year-old nephew in a traffic accident. Chiles previously served time in prison for his role in a bank robbery. ""When a person comes up before a judge for an armed robbery, a bank robbery -- like the guy who shot the person who hit the 2-year-old -- he got a 13-year sentence, of which he served two years, and he's put right back on the street,"" Clarke said. ""We don’t have a law problem -- we don’t need more laws -- we need tougher sentencing."" Clarke's claim suggests Chiles was sentenced to 13 years in prison but served only two. That’s not what happened. Chiles’ case Late on the afternoon of April 12, 2015, a Sunday, Chiles’ 2-year-old nephew ran into a Milwaukee street and was killed by a passing van. Moments later, Chiles emerged. He shot the driver in the head and in a spray of bullets, fatally wounded his own 15-year-old nephew.  (Four days later, with police in pursuit, Chiles killed himself in a suburban Chicago hotel room.) The bank robbery occurred nearly four years earlier, on Aug. 4, 2011. Chiles, the getaway driver, was charged with being a party to the crime of robbery with threat of force. He pleaded guilty and, in January 2012, was sentenced. by Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Jeffrey Conen. Here is what Chiles could have faced and what he actually served for the bank robbery, in terms of time in prison and on extended supervision. The figures are based on state law and court records and were confirmed by the prosecutor who handled the bank robbery case.   Total term Portion in prison Portion on supervision Maximum possible sentence 15 years 10 years 5  years Chiles’ sentence 4 years 2  years 2 years   A few notes on the figures: Length of sentence: Chiles benefited from helping the district attorney’s office. The judge was told that Chiles cooperated in an unrelated homicide case that stemmed from an argument during a dice game, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. The way a prosecutor put it, Chiles testified at the trial of ""a more dangerous offender"" and that man was convicted of first-degree reckless homicide. Time incarcerated: Chiles was credited for the time he spent in jail while his case was pending, which is common. So, of his two years behind bars, he served six months in jail and a year and a half in prison. Extended supervision: Chiles was released from prison in August 2013 and was due to remain on extended supervision until August 2015. That meant he still had about four months to serve at the time of his death. Clarke’s position As for Clarke’s claim, let’s note that when people talk about sentencing in a felony case, they usually think about the time an offender is being sent to prison. But technically, the sentence includes both time in prison plus time on extended supervision after the offender is released. Clarke’s spokeswoman, Fran McLaughlin, told us the sheriff meant to say Chiles could have gotten a 13-year sentence. But she acknowledged the total maximum sentence was actually 15 years -- 10 years in prison, plus five years of extended supervision. McLaughlin said Clarke’s point was that Chiles could have received a 15-year sentence but he served only two years in prison. But Clarke’s claim ignores the fact that Chiles would not have been given the maximum sentence, since he had been a cooperating witness in a homicide and a recommendation for a lesser sentence was part of the plea agreement. Our rating Clarke said the man who killed a motorist who fatally struck a 2-year-old was ""back on the street"" because he had received a 13-year sentence for bank robbery but only ""served two years."" Chiles’ sentence was four years, not 13. Chiles did spend two years behind bars, as Clarke indicated, but he was also sentenced to two years of extended supervision",Mostly False,"April 30, 2015"
"""It’s estimated that 40 percent of all the guns that are sold in the United States occur with no background records check.""","U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine commemorated the eighth anniversary of the Virginia Tech shootings that left 32 dead with a call for stronger gun laws. ""It’s estimated that 40 percent of all the guns that are sold in the United States occur with no background records check,"" Kaine, D-Va., said during an April 16 floor speech.  We asked Kaine’s office for the source of the statistic. Sarah Peck, his press secretary, pointed to a 1997 study by the U.S. National Institute of Justice that looked at gun owners’ responses to a 1994 national survey that asked them how they acquired their weapons. The researchers concluded 60 percent of the guns were bought from federally licensed firearm dealers and therefore subject to background checks. Federal licensed sellers have to conduct background checks before sales, individual private sellers and gift givers do not. The co-authors of the study had released a more detailed report on their gun owners’ survey in 1996, estimating that between 30-40 percent of all guns transactions occurred through an ""off-the-books"" transfer in which a background check isn’t required. The 40 percent figure has been long offered by gun control advocates as evidence that the nation needs tighter background check laws. But there’s been much debate about the research, conducted by Philip Cook of Duke University and Jens Ludwig of the University of Chicago, including:  The 1994 survey was conducted eight months after the Brady Act went into effect, mandating background checks on individuals seeking to buy firearms from federally licensed dealers. Survey participants were asked about gun their acquisitions going back two years.Some of the participants made gun purchases prior to the Brady Act, when they were not required to undergo federal background checks. Only a small group of gun owners -- 251 people -- answered the survey question about the origin of their weapons. Some of the gun owners weren’t sure how they’d gotten their guns, answering ""probably"" or ""probably not"" on whether they got the gun from a licensed firearm dealer. The 40 percent figure included transactions when a firearm was not sold but, for example, inherited or given as a gift. When the Fact Checker at The Washington Post asked Ludwig in 2013 to boil down the 1994 data, the researcher said that between 14 to 22 percent of the guns were purchased without background checks. The survey is almost 21 years old and begs a question: What’s the modern-day percentage of guns sold without a background check? Cook pointed us to an editorial he and Ludwig wrote about the 40 percent statistic for the National Review in the aftermath of the December 2012 shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. ""We’ve been following the give-and-take with some interest because our research is the original source of that 40-percent statistic,"" they wrote. ""Our views may come as a surprise: First, we don’t know the current percentage -- nor does anyone else."" Ludwig and Cook said their national survey had not been replicated. Updated data doesn’t exist, in large part, because federal funding for gun studies dried up two decades ago. President Barack Obama in 2013 signed an executive order to get the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other agencies to reexamine gun violence. The research is in progress.  There’s debate among researchers about whether the two-decade old figure on gun purchases without background checks remains reliable. Some, like Jay Corzine, a sociology professor at the University of Central Florida, say it is.  ""That 40 percent without a background check is a pretty good estimate,"" said Corzine, who has researched crime prevention and the role of firearms in violence. ""I have no quarrel with it."" The Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, is less certain. The think tank said in a 2013 report that the figure has ""clear limitations"" given its age, and the fact that it comes from a survey of a small group of gun owners. ""Proponents of universal background checks, including this report’s authors, would be well served by acknowledging the limitations of the statistic,"" the center wrote.  Our ruling Kaine says ""it’s estimated that 40 percent of all the guns that are sold in the United States occur with no background records check."" His source is a small-sample survey that’s almost 21 years old. It counted some firearms that were purchased before a law went into effect requiring federal background checks for many gun sales. The 1994 survey measured gun transactions, which included firearms that were sold and those that were given as gifts or inheritances. When the results were adjusted to guns sold -- the term Kaine uses -- only 14 to 22 percent of the firearms were sold without background checks.  The researchers say they ""don’t know"" if their findings are relevant today. There’s no updated national study.   Kaine did not acknowledge these points",Mostly False,"April 28, 2015"
"""There's no statistical evidence that"" a waiting period for handgun purchases ""reduces violence whatsoever.""","Amid a surge in murderous gun violence in Milwaukee, the Republican-controlled Wisconsin Senate voted to repeal a state law that requires a two-day wait for handgun purchases. Just before the April 21, 2015, vote, the author of the bill, state Sen. Van Wanggaard, made this waiting-period claim: ""There’s no statistical evidence that it reduces violence whatsoever,"" the Racine Republican declared. With the repeal bill moving to the GOP-controlled Assembly, and likely headed for GOP Gov. Scott Walker, let’s see if Wanggaard is right. The law The District of Columbia and 10 states, including Wisconsin, Minnesota, Illinois and Iowa, have laws that require a waiting period for purchases of at least some types of guns, according to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. Wisconsin’s law, in place since 1976, applies only to handguns and only to purchases from firearms dealers. It prohibits a handgun buyer from taking possession of the weapon until 48 hours after a background check is started -- even if the check comes back clean within a matter of hours or minutes. The City of Milwaukee, the Wisconsin Coalition Against Domestic Violence and the Wisconsin Medical Society are among groups that oppose scrapping the law. Some say the cooling-off period can help prevent crimes of passion, such as domestic violence. Under the repeal bill from Wanggaard, who is a retired Racine police traffic investigator, a buyer could take possession of a handgun as soon as the seller completes the background check. Groups backing the repeal include the National Rifle Association, the Milwaukee Police Association union and the Wisconsin Wildlife Federation. Some say the wait following a successful background check is an ""unnecessary time tax on both the purchaser and the dealer,"" and that a person who needs a gun for protection can be put at risk. Walker has indicated he supports the repeal. Asked about such a measure in February 2015, he told the NRA: ""I think we want to be a leader in this area as well."" Studies Here are highlights from some key studies about the effects of waiting-period laws: A study done by one researcher from Georgetown University and one from Duke University that was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 2000 examined the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, a 1994 federal law that established a nationwide waiting period and background check for handgun sales. (The waiting period provision was later removed.) The study concluded that the law’s waiting period was associated with reductions in the firearm suicide rate for people age 55 and older, but not associated with reductions in homicide rates or overall suicide rates. Other research has found that people who buy handguns are at a higher risk of committing suicide during the first week after the purchase. For example, an article published in 2000 by members of the Firearm Injury Center at the Medical College of Wisconsin said a Wisconsin study found a ""sharp increase"" in the risk of suicide within one week of a gun purchase. But a 2003 report by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that reviewed studies on the effects of waiting periods on violence found that some studies indicated a decrease in violent outcomes associated with the delay, while others indicated an increase. And a 2012 study by one researcher from the University of Cincinnati and another from Arizona State University found no statistical effects from waiting periods on gun crimes. In a nutshell, except for suicide, the studies show Wanggaard’s claim about waiting periods and violence is largely correct. Experts Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins University Center for Gun Policy and Research, told us there is research linking more thorough background checks -- which take longer than an instant FBI check -- with reduced homicide rates. The more thorough checks are more likely to turn up reasons why a person cannot legally purchase a gun. But Webster said he is not aware of research that shows waiting periods reduce violence. Similarly, Harvard’s David Hemenway said he was aware only of research that links lower suicide rates with wait periods. Many studies link lower levels of lethal violence with strong gun control laws in general, but not with particular laws such as a waiting period, he said. Our rating Wanggaard said, ""There’s no statistical evidence that"" a waiting period for handgun purchases ""reduces violence whatsoever.""

"Florida has the most concealed weapon permits in the nation, ""nearly double that of the second state, which is Texas.""","Facing a long list of GOP presidential contenders at the National Rifle Association’s annual convention, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush touted his own pro-gun rights record. Bush took a friendly jab at another potential presidential contender in the room: ""Today there are well over 1.3 million law-abiding Floridians with a valid concealed weapons permit, 1.3 million. That’s the most in the nation -- nearly double that of the second state, which is Texas. Sorry, Gov. Perry."" Yep, Florida does have 1,384,756 million concealed weapon permit holders as of March 2015. It’s not surprising that Florida would be among the top states for the number of gun permits since it is now the third most populous state in the country. But does Florida lead the nation in gun permits and is that nearly double that of the second state, which is Texas? We were fired up to find the facts. Comparing state permit figures A spokesman for Bush’s PAC referred us to an August 2014 article in the Washington Times, which stated Florida led the nation with 1.3 million in concealed carry permits while Texas came in second with just over 708,000. We sought to independently find current statistics. The U.S. Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, last studied the number of active concealed weapons permits by state in 2012 based on data as of Dec. 31, 2011, in most cases. It found Florida was No. 1 with 887,000 permits at the time, followed by Pennsylvania 786,000, Georgia 600,000 permits and Texas with 519,000 permits. Looking for more current numbers, we found Florida had nearly 1.4 million permit holders as of March 2015, while Texas has 825,957 as of December 2014, according to each state's official count. Florida’s number is about 1.7 times higher than Texas, which is close to Bush’s words of ""nearly double."" To determine if Texas is No. 2, we tried to find a more current number for gun permits in Pennsylvania and Georgia. Those two states don’t make such data as readily and publicly available as Florida and Texas. Pennsylvania has 1,064,360 active carry permits, State Trooper Adam Reed, a spokesman for the state police, told PolitiFact. So Pennsylvania, not Texas, is No. 2. In Georgia, 159 probate judges report the number of applications for weapons licenses to the Administrative Office of the Courts; however, some judges fail to report the number of applicants, resulting in no firm number. PolitiFact Georgia found that the state’s compiled number was in the ballpark of 500,000 in 2012, but the numbers have been increasing. Other estimates we have seen are higher, but none exceeded the total in Texas. (The courts sent us the total number of applications in 2013 which was about 169,000.) Some caveats about conceal carry laws and Bush’s claim While Bush’s claim is based on the sheer number of permits, another valid way to measure access to gun permits is to look at the rate in each state. The 2012 GAO report, using 2010 Census data for the adult population, shows Florida’s rate at 6.2 -- equal to Connecticut but less than Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee and Utah. The rules about conceal carry and each state vary, so it’s worth mentioning some caveats we have noted before. Several states, including Florida, allow out-of-state residents to acquire concealed weapons permits. As of March, about 192,000 out-of-state residents have Florida permits, representing about 13 percent of the total. Two populous states are notably absent from the top of the list: California and New York. Those states are considered a ""may issue"" states, which gives those states much more discretion over who gets a permit. That means it is harder to get a permit there than in a state such as Florida which is a ""shall issue"" state. We interviewed John R. Lott, president of the Crime Prevention Research Center which compiles data on gun permits in states. Lott, an academic and Fox News columnist, published the book More Guns, Less Crime through the University of Chicago in 2010. He said there are four factors that influence the number of gun permits in a state: the amount of fees, hours of required training, how many places people can or can’t carry their firearms and how many years the rules have been in effect. For example, Pennsylvania has one of the lower fees, while Florida has higher fees but close to average in terms of training requirements. Our ruling Bush said Florida has the most concealed weapon permits in the nation, ""nearly double that of the second state, which is Texas."" There are three parts to this claim. On the first one, Bush is correct that Florida leads the nation in the sheer number of gun permits -- the most current figure is nearly 1.4 million. However, eight states have a higher per-capita rate of gun permits than Florida. When he says that Florida has ""nearly double"" the number of permits as Texas he is in the ballpark -- Texas has about 826,000. So Florida has about 1.7 times as many permit holders. Where Bush misses the mark is when he says that Texas is the second state in terms of gun permits. Current data from the Pennsylvania state patrol showed slightly more than one million permits -- so more than Texas",Mostly True,"April 15, 2015"
"In Wisconsin, a ""second arrest for carrying pot is a felony,"" but a second or subsequent arrest ""for carrying a gun illegally is a misdemeanor.""","Even in a city repeatedly scarred by senseless fatal shootings -- a 10-year-old girl caught in the crossfire at a playground, a toddler struck by a bullet aimed at the wrong house -- this case stood out: A man driving his van in Milwaukee late on a Sunday afternoon struck and killed a 2-year-old boy who had darted into the street. He jumped out of the vehicle immediately and was grieving as he stood over the body. Moments later, a gunman, apparently enraged about the accident, shot the 40-year-old driver to death. But he also fatally wounded a 15-year-old, the toddler’s brother, who had rushed to the scene. Reacting to the incident, Mayor Tom Barrett linked increases in fatal and non-fatal shootings in Milwaukee with gun laws. In turn, Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. criticized the mayor, saying Barrett was blaming concealed carry permit holders for more guns being on the street. Then, Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn, while speaking to reporters on April 14, 2015, two days after the accident and double-shooting, responded to the sheriff. ""We're the only place I know,"" Flynn said, referring to Wisconsin, ""where it's a misdemeanor to carry a gun illegally, but a felony for a second rap for carrying pot. Would you tell me how that makes sense? ""Second arrest for carrying pot is a felony. Second, third, fourth, 10th arrest for carrying a gun illegally is a misdemeanor. Is it any wonder these knuckleheads out there with guns aren't learning a lesson from getting locked up by us?""​ Is Flynn right about the Wisconsin laws? Except for some clarification, yes. Marijuana Carrying marijuana -- for a second offense and subsequent offenses -- is, in fact, a felony crime. But that doesn't necessarily mean a felony charge will be filed. Prosecutors generally have discretion in charging.  So, while someone with a clean criminal record who is caught a second time carrying a marijuana joint technically has committed a felony offense, a prosecutor might decide to only issue a ticket. It’s also worth noting that carrying marijuana can be a felony on a first offense -- if you’re carrying with the intent to deliver, for instance. (Coincidentally, the day before Flynn made his claim, state Rep. Melissa Sargent, D-Madison, announced she would introduce a bill to legalize marijuana in Wisconsin. With Republicans controlling both houses of the Legislature, the measure has virtually no chance of passing.) Guns Wisconsin legalized the concealed carry of guns and other weapons in 2011. Carrying a concealed gun without a state-issued concealed carry license is a misdemeanor, for the first offense and for any subsequent offenses. It’s worth noting that someone convicted of any misdemeanor on three separate occasions within five years can be sentenced to more time behind bars. So, someone convicted of carrying a concealed gun illegally could be punished more if they are also convicted of two other misdemeanors, whether gun-related or not, within five years. In addition, for certain people, carrying a gun is a felony on the first offense. That includes convicted felons and people who are subject to an injunction such as a domestic violence restraining order. Our rating Flynn said that in Wisconsin, a ""second arrest for carrying pot is a felony,"" but a second or subsequent arrest ""for carrying a gun illegally is a misdemeanor."" A second arrest for carrying marijuana is classified as a felony offense, although depending on the circumstances, only a ticket might be issued. And generally a first or subsequent offense for carrying a gun illegally is a misdemeanor -- although for some people, such as convicted felons, a first offense is a felony",Mostly True,"April 15, 2015"
"""U.S. police killed more people in just one month than the U.K.’s did in over a century.""","As the country learned about the shooting death of Walter Scott in North Charleston, S.C., a comparison between police in the United States and the United Kingdom began to spread across the Internet. The liberal website Addicting Info put up a graphic under the headline ""U.S. Police killed more people in just one month than the U.K.’s did in over a century."" Other groups made similar claims -- including RT, the English language cable channel financed by the Russian government. According to Addicting Info: U.S. police killed 111 people in March 2015 U.K. police killed 69 people from 1900-present. A reader asked us to check it out.  Tracing the source of the data Addicting Information used this eye-catching graphic to tell its story.  You won’t find this image on the Addicting Information website any longer. Elisabeth Parker, the author of the piece, explained to us where she got her information. She started with a post that made a similar but not identical claim on Daily Kos, a liberal website. The post’s count of American deaths in March tracked back to a website called Killed by Police. Killed by Police has a singular task. Each time a television station or newspaper reports that a person has died at the hands of the police, the people behind Killed by Police (we don’t know who they are) add a link to the news story in a spreadsheet. When we saw the list for deaths in March, it had 115 entries. We read each news report and found that just about every death, 98 of them, involved a police shooting. There were 16 cases when a person died from other causes, most frequently when police used a taser. One time an officer accidentally hit and killed a person with his car. In a category by itself, an officer in Hawaii got into an argument with a neighbor and killed him, thus becoming a common murderer completely apart from his role in law enforcement. The warning here is the warning with all fact-checks and analysis of police-related deaths. There is no singular, verified U.S. database of police shootings. So all we have are estimates. In this case, University of Missouri-St.Louis criminologist David Klinger said the Killed by Police numbers -- whether you settle on 98, 111 or some other figure -- ""wouldn’t be unexpected."" Deaths in the United Kingdom So, yes, the U.S. figure for March is plausible. But this claim really hinges on the stat encompassing more than 100 years in the United Kingdom. The fact is, that relies on a Wikipedia list of killings by law enforcement officers in the United Kingdom. ""I pored over the Wikipedia entry and realized that some incidents included multiple shootings and adjusted (the) figure to 69 police shootings,"" Parker said. The problem with that is that Parker had to make two big assumptions: That the list was accurate, and more critically, that it was complete. With Wikipedia, those are assumptions people should not make. In fact, the Wikipedia entry warns at the top that ""This list is incomplete."" So what’s the real number? Over such a long time horizon -- and in a country whose borders changed (Ireland was part of the United Kingdom until the 1920s) -- it’s really impossible to say. The British advocacy group Inquest has looked at police incidents in England and Wales going back to 1990. By its count, there were 55 police shooting deaths between 1990 and the present. The group reports another 1,453 deaths that had some connection to contact with police. However, the causes range from someone dying of a drug overdose while at a police station, to car thieves killing themselves in a wreck, to suicide while in custody, to excessive use of force by officers. There simply is no way to tease out the details. Comparing police shootings to the American data is the only reliable approach. The only other country in the United Kingdom for which we found hard numbers was Northern Ireland. Between April 2008 and September 2014, roughly a six-year period, members of the Police Force of Northern Ireland discharged their weapons nine times. However, there is no data on whether any deaths resulted. During the times of ""The Troubles"" from 1968 to about 2000 when separatists, generally Catholics, and unionists, generally Protestants, battled over whether Northern Ireland should break away or remain part of the United Kingdom, there were over 3,000 deaths. Some of those were at the hands of the police. Aogan Mulcahy, a researcher in the School of Sociology at the University College Dublin, walked us through the numbers. The Royal Ulster Constabulary was the police force in Northern Ireland until 2001. Based on an online database, Mulcahy told us that the RUC ""was responsible for 55 deaths over the period 1969-2001."" We found no information for Scotland. We should note that only the Northern Ireland police regularly carry firearms. In Scotland, Wales and England, the typical officer relies on less lethal equipment such as nightsticks, pepper spray and tasers. In sum, we know Wikipedia’s count is far low, but we don’t know how low. When we alerted Parker to the information we were finding, she retracted her original article and wrote another. Parker wrote that ""U.S. police killed more people in one month than the U.K.’s did in an entire year."" While the underlying numbers this time are still incomplete, that’s more accurate. Our ruling Addicting Information said that ""U.S. police killed more people in just one month than the U.K.’s did in over a century."" This comparison was based on an incomplete Wikipedia list. While hard figures for the number of police-related deaths in the United Kingdom over more than a century are impossible to come by, our research shows the comparison is inaccurate. It’s certainly unproven",False,"April 15, 2015"
"""Suntrust Bank cancels account because company sells guns.""","A bank suddenly closing checking accounts for a Brooksville pawn shop that sells guns has opened up Internet speculation that the Obama administration influenced the decision. Under the headline ""Suntrust Bank Cancels Account Because Company Sells Guns,"" the website FloridaNewsFlash.com recounts how American Gun & Pawn owner Steve Champion received a letter from SunTrust dated March 20, 2015, telling him his deposit accounts, safe deposit boxes and credit cards would be closed. (A reader first alerted us to the story after seeing it on Facebook.) The letter said that after an account review, American Gun & Pawn’s accounts were no longer jibing with SunTrust’s ""corporate business objectives."" There were no specifics in the letter, beyond information that he had a month to close his accounts or they would be closed for him. When Champion contacted the bank, he said a service rep told him he had received ""one of those gun letters going around to the gun and pawn shops."" The bank wouldn’t reverse the decision. Champion posted the letter on his shop’s Facebook page, kicking off a flurry of conspiracy theories that SunTrust and other banks were working at the behest of the Obama administration, which was trying to stamp out gun sales nationwide. FloridaNewsFlash.com, apparently first to report the news online, stoked the fire by saying it was part of an ominous program from the Obama administration called ""Operation Choke Point."" Many other sites have followed suit. SunTrust told us they didn’t close American Gun & Pawn’s accounts because the shop sold guns. As we dug into the details, we found that the bank was ending its relationship with some types of customers, but those customers weren't specifically gun shops.  Bank policy SunTrust denied they are closing accounts with gun shops, but they are ending relationships with pawn shops. ""Any suggestion that this is a firearms issue is inaccurate,"" spokesman Michael McCoy told us. SunTrust announced in a Aug. 8, 2014, press release that the bank had ""decided to discontinue banking relationships with three types of businesses – specifically payday lenders, pawn shops and dedicated check-cashers – due to compliance requirements."" The bank still works with firearms dealers, according to the release. It takes a little guesswork to determine just why SunTrust has stopped dealing with all pawn shops. There’s no specific regulation saying the bank can’t work with them, and SunTrust would only reiterate to us that they had adopted the policy. And we did find other cases of SunTrust dropping pawn shops in other parts of the country. We’re not going to weigh in on whether or not it’s fair for banks to deny accounts to pawn shops or payday lenders, although Champion said it was an unfair end to two decades of banking. ""I’ve heard about stuff like this,"" he told PolitFact Florida. ""But it doesn’t matter either way, whether I’m a pawn shop or a gun shop, because I’m a legal business. This is not right."" Choke Point FloridaNewsFlash.com writer Samuel McCall didn’t want to comment on the record about Champion’s story, but said he reported it the way Champion told it to him. McCall’s report tied the SunTrust letter to the aforementioned Operation Choke Point. The U.S. Justice Department started Operation Choke Point in 2012 as a way to stop banking fraud. The operation specifically investigated banks’ relationships with ""third-party payment processors"" -- the payment services that online stores often rely upon -- to determine if they were defrauding consumers. Gun rights advocates drew a connection between gun dealers and Choke Point from 2011 guidelines from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. that identified so-called ""high-risk"" businesses that commonly use third-party payment processors. The guidelines warned merchants who used these services had higher than normal potential for committing fraud. The FDIC list included pawn shops, payday lenders, pornography and yes, firearms and ammunition dealers. (The list also included telemarketers, fireworks sellers, dating services and coin dealers, among others.) This list led to a firestorm of criticism that the government was attempting to shut down legal businesses through Choke Point, eventually resulting in an investigation by the House Oversight Committee. A report from chairman Darrell Issa, R-Calif., concluded in May 2014 that the FDIC list had become a sort of hit list of businesses for Choke Point to target. The Justice Department denied the charge, saying none of their cases involved legal businesses like gun dealers or porn, and the FDIC removed the list in July 2014. Justice Department spokesman Patrick Rodenbush told us the three fraud cases that stemmed from Choke Point involved banks.  ""In no case has the department targeted any lawful enterprise, such as gun or ammunition sellers,"" he said. But the American Banking Association told us it was likely banks had been influenced by federal guidelines in some fashion, though it had no specific information about which ones or why. The FDIC addressed banking concerns with a letter in January 2015 urging banks to evaluate customers ""on a case-by-case basis"" instead of denying service to entire categories of businesses out of fear of not complying with federal law. In any case, the backlash against the program continues, with groups like the U.S. Consumer Coalition running a website allowing people to share their stories of businesses allegedly being affected by Choke Point. Brian Wise, senior adviser for the group, contends Choke Point has one purpose the government won’t admit: ""To go after businesses they couldn’t legislate out of existence for the last two decades."" Our ruling FloridaNewsFlash.com said, ""Suntrust Bank Cancels Account Because Company Sells Guns."" Actually, the bank decided recently to end relationships with pawn shops, payday lenders and check cashers, but it will still work with firearms dealers. The FDIC has warned banks to examine relationships with customers that use third-party payment processors, because of the risk of consumer fraud, and a federal program called Operation Choke Point has investigated the same issue. Gun rights advocates have argued that Operation Choke Point is a backdoor way of targeting gun shops, but the government denies there’s any such plan to target gun dealers, and no one has been able to truly prove otherwise",Mostly False,"April 8, 2015"
"""You know how many children in the history of the United States have died in a fire (at school)? Zero.""","By next school year, some school workers may be allowed to pack heat. A bill that has received approval by some legislative panels would allow superintendents to designate certain K-12 employees to carry concealed firearms. State Rep. Greg Steube, R-Sarasota, a sponsor of the bill, said the measure makes a lot of sense considering school shootings of recent years. Here’s what he said during a Florida House judiciary committee hearing April 2: ""Right now our schools are required to do two or three fire drills a year. You know how many children in the history of the United States have died in a fire? Zero. You know how many have died because of a school shooting? Quite a few, but the state doesn’t require them to do any type of training. So this would require them to do, every year two times, school safety training as it relates to active shooters to work out these type of details that need to be worked out."" The committee voted in favor of the bill -- as did two other House panels in March. We were alerted to Steube’s statement about the lack of fatal school fires by Associated Press reporter Gary Fineout who tweeted about it. So we decided to check it out.   Data on school fires Steube told PolitiFact Florida that he ""definitely misspoke"" about school fires. ""I was talking about Florida,"" said Steube, who first proposed such legislation in 2013 after the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. ""There has never been in the history of Florida a child who died in a school fire."" Steube said the point he was trying to make is that Florida schools are required to do fire drills, but not lockdown drills. (Staff analysis of the bill states that schools must develop procedures for hostage and weapons situations; Steube’s bill inserts language that requires schools to do drills for active shooter/hostage situations.) Some school districts already do lockdown drills including in Broward, Hillsborough, Miami-Dade Pasco and Pinellas counties. We drew information about fatal school fires from the National Fire Protection Association. The association lists school fires with 10 or more deaths. Most of the fires go back to the first half of the 20th century. We will summarize a few of the fires: Consolidated School in New London, Texas: This school fire has the largest number of fatalities documented by the association. A gas explosion in March 18, 1937, led to the deaths of 294 students and teachers at the school which was next to an oil refinery. A teacher turned on a sanding machine in an area filled with a mixture of gas and air, which set off the fire. ""Immediately the building seemed to lift in the air and then smashed to the ground. Walls collapsed. The roof fell in and buried its victims in a mass of brick, steel, and concrete debris,"" states history from a museum that memorializes the fire. Lakeview School in Collinwood, Ohio: A suburban Cleveland elementary school caught fire and killed 173 children and three adults on March 4, 1908. A furnace set fire to wooden supports, and the conflagration quickly spread throughout the building. Our Lady of the Angels school, Chicago: On Dec. 1 , 1958, fire broke out at the foot of a stairway in the school, killing 90 pupils and three nuns. A student smoking might have been the cause. Thankfully, those types of fires are no longer common due to modern safety standards. ""In recent years, the very few deaths that do occur in schools tend to be either adults or juvenile firesetters who set a fire in the school,"" said Marty Ahrens, who works for the association. In recent decades, the association has collected fire data through the federal government’s National Fire Incident Reporting System and its own survey. Between 2007-11, U.S. fire departments responded to an estimated average of 5,690 structure fires in educational properties including day cares, K-12 schools and colleges. These fires caused an annual average of 85 civilian fire injuries and $92 million in direct property damage.  In search of fires at schools in Florida Since Steube told us that he meant to say there had been no children who died in fires at Florida schools, we asked state experts if they could recall any. A spokeswoman for the state fire marshal said there were no fire-related fatalities in K-12 schools between 2000 and 2014, which includes all available incidents in the fire marshal’s database. We did find a case of a 4-year-old girl dying in a fire at a day care center in Tallahassee. A malfunctioning fan caused a fire at Stepping Stones child care center in Tallahassee in 2008. The day before the fire, a problem with a bathroom exhaust fan was noted on a repair sheet. A ""floater"" teacher assigned to the girl and her class that day had not yet been trained on what to do in a fire and was scheduled to be trained that day, the Tallahassee Democrat reported. We also found records of a dormitory fire in 1914 that killed six children and two staff members at the Arthur G. Dozier School for Boys, the infamous reform school in Marianna (although that was a penal institution and not a traditional school). The school’s superintendent and staff were on a ""pleasure bent"" in town when the fire started. The superintendent was dismissed after facts were presented to a grand jury. The school was shut down in 2011 after a bleak history full of rape, torture and unreported child deaths. Our ruling When talking about a bill to designate certain people in K-12 schools to carry firearms, Steube said ""You know how many children in the history of the United States have died in a fire (at school)? Zero."" There have been at least eight school fires with 10 or more deaths in the United States, though the most recent one was in 1958, according to a national association that tracks such fatal fires. None on that list were in Florida. Steube admitted that he misspoke -- he meant to say no children died in school fires in Florida",False,"April 6, 2015"
"""According to the state of Florida, you are almost twice as likely to be attacked by an alligator than by someone who happens to carry a conceal-and-carry permit.""","The Florida Legislature is moving toward allowing guns on college campuses. House and Senate panels have voted in favor of a proposal that would let concealed weapon license holders -- who must be 21 -- have their guns in college facilities. Currently, Florida is one of 20 states that specifically ban firearms on campuses; seven others specifically allow them under state law. The rest leave the decision up to the university. The Legislature had previously rejected allowing guns on campuses, but a shooting last year reignited the debate. Gunman Myron May, a former Florida State University student, wounded two students and a library employee before he was killed by police on Nov. 20, 2014. During a Senate Higher Education Committee hearing on March 16, 2015, students testified both for and against the proposal. ""According to the state of Florida, you are almost twice as likely to be attacked by an alligator than by someone who happens to carry a conceal-and-carry permit, and that was a study over the first 10 years of the conceal-carry law in Florida,"" said Erek Culbreath, president of Florida Students for Concealed Carry, a group that advocates for concealed carry of firearms on all the campuses. Are gator attacks twice as common as attacks by someone who has a conceal-and-carry permit? We went in search of the evidence. Data on gators and guns Florida’s concealed weapon permit program started in 1987. Currently, about 1.3 million people have Florida concealed weapon licenses. (By coincidence, the number of estimated wild alligators in Florida is also 1.3 million.) We found no study that compared gator attacks with any sort of ""attack"" by gun license owners. What Culbreath sent us -- and what we found elsewhere -- was that over the years, pro-gun advocates obtained separate data from state officials on gator attacks and gun license revocations and combined them to make such a comparison. In fact, this claim even made its way to the Connecticut General Assembly when politicians there considered a handgun safety bill in 1998. For example, one website wrote it this way in 1999:  ""Do firearms carry laws result in chaos? No. Consider the case of Florida. A citizen in the Sunshine State is almost twice as likely to be attacked by an alligator than to be assaulted by a concealed carry holder. During the first ten years that the Florida law was in effect, alligator attacks outpaced the number of crimes committed by carry holders by a 146 to 88 margin."" (The footnotes stated that the information came from a Fish and Wildlife Conservation spokesman and a statistical report about gun licenses.) We obtained some updated data from state officials. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission has documented the number of alligator bites on people between 1948 and November 2013 for a total of 357 bites. (For the record, that is strictly bites by alligators and not crocodiles, which are rare.) During the hearing, Culbreath mentioned data from the first 10 years of concealed carry in Florida. We found no comprehensive source of data for ""attacks"" by gun license holders. However, the state does have data on revocations for misuse of a firearm. Between October 1987 and February 2015, the state revoked 9,636 concealed weapon or firearm license permits, according to data maintained by the state Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, which handles gun permits. Of that group, 168 were revoked for misuse of a firearm. (In January 2011 the state stopped maintaining information about the breakdown of license revocations by type.) We were unable to obtain more details about whether those 168 assaulted someone or misused the gun in some other way. We also couldn’t isolate data just for 1987 through 1997 to provide a decade comparison to the alligator bites. But overall, alligator bites happen more often than the revocation of gun permits for misuse of firearms. Is it a meaningful comparison? Experts didn’t think it should carry much weight in the policymaking process. ""As for comparing bites to bullets, it is more than silly,"" said James Alan Fox, criminology professor at Northeastern University. ""The risk of attack by an armed person exists virtually anywhere one travels. Gators only attack near certain bodies of water. At the University of Florida, for example, the only gator you’ll see is the mascot at sporting events."" (After our fact-check posted we heard from a couple of readers who noted that there are indeed actual live alligators on the University of Florida campus. ""We do indeed have real alligators on campus,"" university spokesman Steve Orlando said. ""There are several in Lake Alice on the west side of campus, though I couldn’t give you an exact number. We have no record of any alligator attacks."") UCLA law professor Adam Winkler, an expert on the Second Amendment, had this to say about our query: ""Are you serious? I'd rather not be attacked by an alligator or a concealed carry permit holder. The data on permit revocations suggest that concealed carry permits are revoked far more often than alligator attacks. Alligators are also subject to stricter controls than concealed carry permit holders: You can't bring an alligator to the mall when you go shopping."" David Hemenway, director of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center and author of the book Private Guns, Public Health, said that revocations don’t capture every misuse of a gun by a permit holder. ""It would be like looking at the small number of driving licenses that are revoked and claiming that is a good measure of how well people are driving,"" he said. Florida State University Professor Gary Kleck said that the comparison to gator attacks was likely used to indicate how rare gun crimes by carry permit holders are. ""It could just as easily been something else that's really rare, like death from meteor strikes or midair aircraft collisions. The point is merely that these things are extremely rare,"" he said. Our ruling Culbreath said, ""According to the state of Florida, you are almost twice as likely to get attacked by an alligator than by someone with a conceal-and-carry permit."" We don't have data on attacks committed by people with conceal-and-carry permits. The gun data is based on an approximation using permit revocations that may or may not accurately reflect the number of ""attacks."" Also, the data is 10 years old.  That said, these statistics, imperfect as they are, do support the notion that both kinds of attacks are uncommon. Whether this is a valid argument in favor of the bill is in the eye of the beholder. We find the statement has an element of truth but ignores other information that would give a different impression",Mostly False,"March 23, 2015"

Lena Taylor expressed her opposition -- suggesting that even most members of the National Rifle Association, which fights restrictions on the right to bear handguns as well as long guns, would side with her against the bill. The Milwaukee Democrat issued a statement after the Republican-sponsored bill was approved by the Senate Judicial and Public Safety Committee in a 3-2 party-line vote. ""Not including background checks (of) all types of firearms, ignoring the public safety and the mental health needs of our state is downright irresponsible,"" said Taylor, who cast one of the no votes. ""Polling showed that even nearly 74 percent of NRA members support requiring background checks for all gun sales."" Setting aside the fact Taylor is muddying the waters by implying a background check would go away -- it won’t -- let’s check her statistic on polling for NRA member support for such measures. Background checks Under federal law, states decide whether they want to process background checks to ensure that people who are prohibited by law from owning guns do not purchase one. In Wisconsin, the state Department of Justice does the checks for handguns, while the FBI does them for long guns. The state’s check of handgun purchasers includes a more extensive review of databases, such as those involving offenses committed by juveniles, than the FBI routinely does. The most recent state figures show that from July 1, 2013 through June 30, 2014, the state processed more than 196,000 background checks for handgun purchases. More than 99 percent of the applications were approved, including more than 29,000 that were approved instantly. The Department of Justice has said that on average, the background checks are done within four hours. The new legislation would not change the requirement for background checks. Supporters say that in most cases, since the checks are done quickly, there is no reason for people to have to wait 48 hours to take possession of the handgun they’re buying. Opponents worry about instances such as a couple getting in an argument and then running out to buy guns before they have a chance to cool off. The polling Now to what recent polling on background checks has found among the several million members of the politically powerful NRA. In March 2013, Lee Leffingwell, then the mayor of Austin, Texas, made a two-part claim that includes the claim Taylor made. He said 90 percent of Americans and 74 percent of NRA members support background checks of gun purchasers. PolitiFact Texas rated his claim True. The key evidence was an article published in the New England Journal of Medicine on a poll done in January 2013 by two entities at Johns Hopkins University -- the Department of Health Policy and Management and the Center for Gun Policy and Research. The poll was conducted online among 2,703 adults -- including 169 NRA members -- through GfK Knowledge Networks, which specializes in working with academic and government researchers to do polling online. It recruits participants randomly via mail and telephone. The poll found that 74 percent (to be precise, 73.7 percent) of NRA members supported requiring background checks for all gun sales. (The margin of error was seven points.) This poll was the most on point that we could find in terms of Taylor’s claim. But we would also note two others done around the same time that included information on NRA households -- in other words, the person responding to the survey or someone in that household was an NRA member at the time. A CBS News/New York Times poll, also from January 2013, found that background checks on all potential gun buyers were favored by 85 percent of NRA households. And a February 2013 poll by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press found that 74 percent of people in NRA households favored making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks.  The NRA did not respond to our requests about Taylor’s claim. But as an organization, it opposes universal background checks. Two days after Taylor issued her statement, the NRA urged its members to oppose newly introduced legislation in Congress that would extend background checks to cover gun transactions at gun shows, over the Internet and in other settings. The statement on the NRA website said the federal bill ""does not address the real problems of fixing the broken mental health system and prosecuting criminals. Further, criminals will never submit to such a system so it will never truly be ‘universal.’""    Our rating Taylor said polling shows that nearly 74 percent of National Rifle Association members ""support requiring background checks for all gun sales."" The most recent national poll of NRA members that we could find, done in January 2013 by Johns Hopkins University, found that 73.7 percent of the members supported requiring background checks for all gun sales",True,"March 18, 2015"
"""Black people are eight times more likely to be arrested than white people"" in Madison.","Two months before the fatal police shooting of an African-American man in Madison, an activist group called the Young, Gifted and Black Coalition decried what it called ""the violence of heavy policing and arrest-rate disparities in Madison."" In an open letter issued Jan. 9, 2015, the Madison-based group called on Police Chief Mike Koval to ""dramatically reduce the number of police contacts with black people and poor people,"" and it made this claim: ""Given that the arrest rate shows that black people are eight times more likely to be arrested than white people, we demand that disparity cut in half by the end of 2015."" In the wake of the March 6, 2015 shooting death of 19-year-old Tony T. Robinson Jr., we thought we would take a look at the claim, which was repeated by U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Madison) three days after the shooting. Robinson case According to Milwaukee Journal Sentinel news reports: Madison police were called shortly before 6:30 p.m. when Robinson started jumping in front of cars on Williamson Street on Madison’s east side. Then in swift succession, Robinson apparently hit a friend and, after entering a house, tried to strangle someone else. A police officer entered the home, got into a struggle with Robinson and shot him. Robinson was not armed. The officer was injured, but did not need to be hospitalized. The shooting quickly drew comparisons by some with other recent high-profile killings by police of black men across the country: Dontre Hamilton at Red Arrow Park in Milwaukee, Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. and Eric Garner in New York City. Protests followed Robinson’s death. One protest, three days after the shooting, drew more than 1,000 people to the State Capitol. Nearly a year before he was killed, on April 25, 2014, Robinson, then 18, was arrested with three other people in connection with an armed home invasion at a Madison apartment.  He pleaded guilty to felony armed robbery and received three years of probation. The officer who shot Robinson, Matt Kenny, who is white, shot and killed a 48-year-old white man in the line of duty on July 15, 2007, after the man pointed what turned out to be a pellet gun at Kenny. The officer did not know the weapon was a pellet gun, and the district attorney cleared Kenny. The claim The Young, Gifted and Black Coalition based its claim on an October 2013 report on racial disparities in Dane County. So, although the claim was about Madison, the report examined the larger surrounding area. The report was done by the Wisconsin Council on Children and Families, a Madison-based liberal advocacy group whose research is respected. The report said that in 2012, African-American adults were arrested in Dane County at a rate more than eight times that of whites. Here are the adult arrest rates per 1,000 adults in 2012:   Black Adults White Adults Ratio of black to white Dane County 295 36 8.19 Wisconsin 230 53 4.34 United States 82 33 2.48   Erica Nelson, the author of the report, told us the figures were developed from an unpublished report of the state Office of Justice Assistance. She said she is working on developing figures strictly for Madison, rather than Dane County, but wouldn’t speculate on how the Madison rate might differ from the county rate. When the coalition first made its claim in the open letter, the police chief responded in a blog post, saying: ""I have always agreed that the harmful impacts of racial disparity in Dane County are not in dispute. An education system that has underserved people of color, high rates of unemployment and underemployment, a lack of suitable guardians or mentors for our youth (leading to greater gang involvement), challenged neighborhoods and a criminal justice system that is fraught with inadequacies are but a few of the drivers that contribute to the malaise we face as a community."" But, he added: ""Based on the diversity and the strength of character personified in our workforce, the training which is second to none and ever-striving for best practices, coupled with checks-and-balances that serve to bring rogue cops or practices to the light of day, I will not buy into the naive supposition that our community's disparity issues are largely owing to a pervasive pattern of systemic racism by MPD."" When we asked Koval about the eight times higher claim, he responded by email through a spokesman, saying that in his initial response to the open letter ""I was not disputing the fact that there are racial disparities; I dispute the fact that I have ‘rogue’ cops or policies/procedures which are intrinsically racist.  There is no doubt but that the police should be mindful of our role as the gatekeepers to the criminal justice system, and therefore ‘own’ part of this problem."" The chief also noted that the figures from the report are for all of Dane County, not just Madison, which ""includes big bedroom communities"" such as Fitchburg and Sun Prairie. Koval said he has not seen any figures for only Madison. Our rating The Young, Gifted and Black Coalition said ""black people are eight times more likely to be arrested than white people"" in Madison. A report the coalition relies on says that in 2012, the arrest rate for black adults was eight times higher than for white adults. However, the figures were for all of Dane County, not merely for Madison, the county’s largest city",Half True,"March 9, 2015"
"Says ""President Obama is using executive actions to impose gun control on the nation, targeting the top-selling rifle in the country ... with a ban on one of the most-used"" assault rifle bullets.","Segments of the gun-rights community are trying to block a proposed ban on certain kinds of bullets by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Paul Bedard, a columnist with the conservative Washington Examiner, recently took up the cry. ""President Obama is using executive actions to impose gun control on the nation,"" Bedard wrote Feb. 27, 2015. ""Targeting the top-selling rifle in the country, the AR-15 style semi-automatic, with a ban on one of the most-used AR bullets by sportsmen and target shooters."" We left phone messages and sent emails several times to Bedard and did not hear back. Our focus is whether Obama is using executive action to impose gun control through a bullet ban.  There’s some information to unpack here. Where the claim comes from Though we didn’t hear back from Bedard, he’s talking about the ATF’s plan for one particular type of bullet -- a 5.56 mm ""green tip."" It is found in SS109 and M855 cartridges, and it’s one of the more popular types of ammunition in America, experts told us. But this February, the ATF announced a proposal to remove an exemption that allowed gun owners to use this particular kind of ammunition. The agency’s reasoning? It can pierce the sort of body armor often worn by police, and it can be fired from a handgun. The ammunition isn’t new, nor is its ability to pierce body armor. What is new is that gun manufacturers are making handguns that use a 5.56 mm ""green tip."" That, ATF says, violates the Law Enforcement Officers Protection Act of 1985 that aimed to ban armor piercing bullets. ""The AR-based handguns and rifles utilize the same magazines and share identical receivers,"" the ATF wrote in an explanatory brief. ""These AR-type handguns were not commercially available when the armor piercing ammunition exemption was granted in 1986. To ensure consistency, upon final implementation of the sporting purpose framework outlined above, ATF must withdraw the exemptions for 5.56 mm ""green tip"" ammunition, including both the SS109 and M855 cartridges."" The public has until March 16 to comment on the proposal. ATF will assess those comments and then issue a final ruling. It has not said when it will decide. Nearly 240 members of Congress signed a letter to ATF opposing the change. ‘Using executive actions’ That’s the background. Now how does that jibe with Bedard’s claim? Bedard called this an executive action by the president. That is a stretch of the common reading of the phrase.  Yes, ATF is part of the executive branch, but there’s no evidence this was a decision made by Obama (compared to, say, Obama’s executive action on immigration.) ATF said the proposal came after it received 30 requests for exemptions to permit this sort of bullet in handguns between 2011 and today. Until then, the agency said it had received few such requests. ATF spokeswoman Janice Kemp told PunditFact ""this started with us."" When this issue came up in a daily White House press briefing, press secretary Josh Earnest said this was an ATF process that was open to public comment. (The comment period ends on March 16.) However, he said the administration supports the proposal as a ""common sense"" step. ""This seems to be an area where everyone should agree that if there are armor-piercing bullets available that can fit into easily concealed weapons, that it puts our law enforcement at considerably more risk,"" Earnest said. ‘Impose gun control on the nation’ Bedard also said Obama’s actions ""impose gun control on the nation."" That claim is also a stretch of the common meaning of the phrase. The ATF says that banning this particular kind of bullet would leave gunowners with 168 other varieties of bullets to use in the same weapons. Bullets made with copper or lead remain legal under the 1986 law. Steven Howard, a Michigan attorney and firearms specialist, agrees with ATF’s basic point.  ""Instead of shooting this particular cartridge with the forbidden bullet, you’d still have a whole bunch of different ones that you could run through,"" he said. ""A lot of this is fear mongering more than anything else. People are afraid that the list of banned ammo will grow."" (Howard among them, he told us.) Another important point: People who already have these bullets could still use them, but they wouldn’t be able to get any more in the future.   That said, removing the exemption for this type of bullet would have consequences. Sam Raheb owns Close Focus Research, a ballistics testing lab in California. Raheb said the main impact on shooters is that their ammunition might cost more. ""Before this, you could get a green-point for about 40 cents a round,"" Raheb said. ""If you had to buy a commercial hunting grade cartridge, it could cost you $1 a round."" Kyle Weaver, the National Rifle Association’s executive director of operations also cited cost during a recent interview. Weaver was asked about the effect on shooter training. ""This is the inexpensive ammo they train with and shoot with,"" Weaver said. ""This is not the high-end stuff. This is what they shoot every day."" And Wes Mason, manager of technical operations at another testing center, HP White Laboratory, said the proposal wouldn’t address other types of handgun ammunition that could pierce armor and would still be legal under the proposed change.   ""Its counterparts have the same characteristics when you’re talking about piercing body armor,"" Mason said. That would make the proposal ineffective in protecting police. Lastly, Bedard said the administration was targeting the rifle version of the AR-15. That is his interpretation. It is the pistol version that drew the ATF’s attention. The agency’s proposal would leave both the pistol and rifle versions untouched, although the ammunition for both would be affected if the ""green tip"" is banned. Our ruling Bedard said Obama was using executive action to impose gun control through a ban on certain bullets. An executive agency, the ATF, has proposed removing an exemption for a specific type of ammunition because gun manufacturers have started selling handguns that fire the rounds. That violates a 1986 federal law, the ATF says, aimed at protecting police from armor piercing bullets. Bedard’s shorthanding this as ""executive action"" is misleading, though Obama does support the proposal.   Also, it’s worth noting that the ban would not amount to gun control per se; the ATF notes that 168 other varieties of bullets will work in the same weapons. The primary impact would be a higher price for ammunition. And while Bedard says the move targets the rifle version, it is the pistol version and the cartridges it uses that lie at the center of the ATF proposal. The claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give another impression",Mostly False,"March 4, 2015"
"""200,000 students attempt suicide every year on college campuses.""","A shooting incident at Florida State University late last year has re-opened a debate in the Florida Legislature about whether to allow guns on college campuses. Gunman Myron May, a former FSU student, wounded two students and a library employee before he was killed by police on Nov. 20, 2014. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, Florida is one of 20 states that specifically ban firearms on campuses; seven others specifically allow them under state law. The rest leave the decision up to the university. In January, a Florida House panel voted to advance a bill that would allow concealed-weapon permit holders to carry their guns on campuses. Then, on Feb. 16, a Senate panel approved the bill. Both votes broke along party lines, with Republicans in support and Democrats in opposition. The bill in question would allow concealed carry permit holders, who must be 21, to carry their firearms into any college or university facility. About 1.3 million people have Florida concealed-carry permits, including about 250,000 between the ages of 21 to 35. During the Senate hearing, college professors and students were among those who testified -- and they came armed with loads of statistics. Marjorie Sanfilippo, an Eckerd College psychology professor who has researched youth access to firearms, expressed concern about allowing guns on campuses. One issue, she said, is that some college students have mental health issues, including depression and anxiety. In fact, college is sometimes the time of life when major illnesses, such as bipolar mood disorder and schizophrenia, first appear. (May, a 31-year-old lawyer who returned to the FSU campus with a gun, suffered from mental health problems.) ""What proponents of this bill won’t tell you is that 200,000 students attempt suicide every year on college campuses -- an all too common event. Is it a stretch to speculate that more of these suicide attempts would be lethal if students had firearms?"" Are suicide attempts that widespread on college campuses? We took a closer look at the available statistics. Statistics on attempted suicide and colleges Sanfilippo told PolitiFact Florida that she took her data from an assessment by the American College Health Association, an advocacy organization for colleges and universities. The association has been collecting health data about college students since 2000. About 76,000 students at 157 colleges and universities took part in the spring of 2012. (The survey included Florida institutions but the association doesn’t release the names of those who participated.) The survey published in 2014 found that about 1.2 percent of college students reported attempting suicide within the past 12 months. There are approximately 20 million college and university students; doing the arithmetic, this translates into about 200,000 suicide attempts. (The association has found similar rates in other years.) Mary Hoban, who oversees the assessment, told PolitiFact Florida there are two caveats. First, the data is self-reported from studies, and second, the schools self-select to participate, ""so our data are not truly generalizable."" We searched for additional data on suicide attempts by college students. Researchers at the University of Texas found that 1 percent of undergraduates had attempted suicide within the past year. That data, from a paper published in 2009, came from a survey of students at 70 colleges and universities. Meanwhile, the Center for Collegiate Mental Health at Penn State University released a study based on data from 140 colleges and universities and 100,000 students for the 2013-14 year. Unlike other studies which reflect the overall student body, the Penn State study is based on data provided by students when they receive mental health services. It also reflects students who have made a suicide attempt within their lifetime -- not just the past year. Over this longer period, the study found, 9 percent of students had made a suicide attempt. Because this survey looked at a specific population that has received mental-health care, the rates will naturally be higher, said Ben Locke, executive director for the center. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has not collected data on suicide attempts by colleges students specifically. However it does have emergency-department data on nonfatal suicide attempts by age. The rate for 20- to 24-year-olds in 2010 was about 300 per 100,000, while the rate for 15- to 19-year-olds was 381 per 100,000. That rate is a lot lower than the one Sanfilippo relied on. However, the use of emergency department visits doesn’t capture people who attempted suicide but didn’t then go to the hospital. ""The actual number presented for care -- especially in an emergency department -- is going to be dramatically lower than people who self-disclose if they had an attempt in the last year,"" said Bill Schmitz, president of the American Association of Suicidology. For example, someone might have tried to overdose on Tylenol but then woke up without serious ill effects. Our ruling Sanfilippo said ""200,000 students attempt suicide every year on college campuses."" That statistic is extrapolated from the American College Health Association’s most recent annual survey, which found that 1.2 percent of college and university students had attempted suicide within the past year. There are approximately 20 million students overall, which translates to about 200,000 suicide attempts. But the study’s author says there are two important caveats: their data is self-reported and the schools self-select to participate. In addition, a different type of survey conducted by the CDC -- one that looked at emergency data -- found a lower rate of suicide in similar age groups, but experts said that’s to be expected because emergency data doesn’t capture attempts that don’t lead to a hospital visit",Half True,"February 20, 2015"
"Say George Washington said that ""when government takes away citizens’ right to bear arms it becomes citizens’ duty to take away government’s right to govern.""","Would George Washington have been an ally to modern-day gun-rights groups? A social-media meme suggests that he would have. Around the time of Washington’s 282nd birthday, a reader sent us the meme, which includes a painting of Washington and a quote purportedly written or uttered by the nation’s first president: ""When government takes away citizens’ right to bear arms it becomes citizens’ duty to take away government’s right to govern."" But are those really Washington’s words? We contacted Edward Lengel, editor in chief of the Papers of George Washington project at the University of Virginia. He said ""there is no evidence that Washington ever wrote or said these words, or any like them."" Lengel cautioned that it’s impossible to prove a negative, but he added that he’s ""as certain as he can be"" that the quote did not originate from George Washington. This is not the first time a similar claim has popped onto our radar screen. In December 2012, PolitiFact Texas rated False a claim made two days after the Newtown elementary school shooting. When U.S. Rep. Louie Gohmert, a Texas Republican, appeared on Fox News Sunday, he was asked why he believed ordinary Americans should be able to buy semi-automatic weapons designed for military use. Gohmert answered in part, ""For the reason George Washington said a free people should be an armed people. It ensures against the tyranny of the government."" PolitiFact Texas contacted Gohmert’s office to seek details on the Washington quotation but didn’t hear back. The closest statement they could find was one Washington made in his first State of the Union address on Jan. 8, 1790: ""A free people ought not only to be armed, but disciplined."" The academic consensus is that Washington was referring to a trained militia to defend the new nation, rather than anticipating citizens seeking to head off perceived governmental tyranny. Ron Chernow, whose Washington: A Life won the 2011 Pulitzer Prize for biography, told PolitiFact Texas that Washington was ""talking about national defense policy, not individuals arming themselves, and the need for national self-sufficiency in creating military supplies."" Some post-Revolutionary lawmakers did expect citizens to own firearms, but Washington does not appear to have been among them, experts said. ""The idea of resistance to tyranny being dependent on a nation of gun-wielding individuals acting at their own behest or even on local initiative would have been anathema to Washington,"" Lengel told PolitiFact Texas. ""Indeed, during the (Revolutionary) war he very frequently lamented the crimes carried out by armed civilians or undisciplined militia against their unarmed neighbors. The solution to these crimes, as he understood it, was to increase the power of the government and the army to prevent and punish them -- not to put more guns in the hands of civilians."" Indeed, during the Whiskey Rebellion in 1794, ""citizens of Western Pennsylvania rose up to fight a new tax on the whiskey they produced,"" said Mary Thompson, research historian at Washington’s Virginia home, Mount Vernon. Washington was ""concerned that success by the rebels would lead to a diminishment of the central/federal government,"" and directed state militias to counter the insurrection -- ""citizen-soldiers,"" she said, ""acting on behalf of the government against their fellow citizens."" Our ruling The meme said George Washington said that ""when government takes away citizens’ right to bear arms it becomes citizens’ duty to take away government’s right to govern."" Experts say there’s no evidence that Washington ever said that -- and there are indications that Washington, if anything, favored the arming of trained militias rather than wide swaths of the population",False,"February 20, 2015"
"In states that have private-sale background checks for handguns ""49 percent fewer women are shot and killed.""","Closing a loophole in state law that allows some Virginians to buy firearms without going through a background check is a matter of life and death to women, according to Lori Haas, state director of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence. Haas was among a number of gun control advocates who spoke at a news conference last month in favor of a series of bills aimed at tightening state firearm laws. Haas has compelling experience with gun violence: Her daughter, Emily, was grazed twice in the head during the 2007 shootings at Virginia Tech that left 32 dead and 17 wounded. Her brief remarks touched on background check laws. All states require licensed gun dealers to conduct a background check before selling a firearm to make sure the prospective buyer does not have a criminal record or disqualifying mental condition. But Virginia and 32 other states don’t require background checks for firearms bought through an unlicensed seller -- someone who isn’t in the routine business of selling guns. Haas backed a bill that would have  narrowed that exception. In states that run background checks for privately-sold handguns, ""49 percent fewer women are shot and killed,"" she said. Since Haas spoke, the General Assembly has scuttled major gun control bills, including the loophole closer. But background checks for all gun buyers is a perennial issue before the legislature and we wondered whether Haas’ statement was correct in terms of the number she used and the cause and effect of background check laws on women’s lives. She told us the figure came from Everytown for Gun Safety, an advocacy group founded by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. The numbers The group issued a report last September examining firearm homicides of women by intimate partners -- current and former husbands, as well as boyfriends. It found that from 2008-2012, the rate of such murders was 46 percent lower in 14 states that had background checks for some or all private handgun sales when compared with the rest of the nation. Stacey Radnor, a spokeswoman with Everytown, said the group also found that the level of non-gun intimate partner homicides of women was much less stark -- only 4.3 percent lower in the states with private-sale background checks for handguns. We should note, however, that Haas’ statement focused on a broader definition of victims.  She cited ""women"" without any reference to whether they were domestic violence victims. So to examine her exact statement, we needed to find figures on gun murders deaths of all women, which are not in Everytown’s report. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention compiles fatality data based on information from death certificates filed in each state. We looked at the 14 states that had background checks on private handgun sales during the 5-year period Everytown references. Those states are California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Rhode Island and Pennsylvania. Three other states have in recent years added private-sale background checks: Colorado, Delaware and Washington. We found those firearms homicide figures of women for all but three states with small populations -- Rhode Island (which requires a background check for private handgun sales) as well as Vermont and Wyoming (which do not). The CDC withholds the number of firearms homicides of women in those states because they are so few in number. But given the small size of each state’s population, it wouldn’t affect the overall trend line for the 47 other states where the information was available. We found that in states with private-sale background checks, the rate of firearm homicides of females age 18 and over was 1.0 per 100,000 women. In the states that didn’t extend background checks to private handgun sales, the homicide rate was 1.6 per 100,000 women in that age group. That means there were 38 percent fewer firearms homicides of women in the states with private-sale background checks for handguns than the rest of the nation, lower than Haas’ statistic but still a significant figure. In Virginia, the rate was 1.4 per 100,000 women. We should note some states without background checks on all handgun sales bucked the trend of lower firearms violence against females. Minnesota, which has no requirement for background checks on private handgun sales, had a rate of 0.6 firearms homicides for every 100,000 women. That was one-third the rate of North Carolina, which requires a background check of anyone seeking to buy a handgun. Cause and effect Two analysts we contacted urged caution in interpreting a correlation in lower rates of gun violence to private-sale background checks. ""Making causal claims is always riskier,"" Jacquelyn White, a psychology professor at the University of North Carolina Greensboro, said in an email. ""States that require background checks may also be more likely to support other efforts that contribute to the well-being of their residents. Remember, correlation is not causation. There may be other factors, such as a more enlightened commitment to creating healthy and safe communities, that result in an array of programs and policies that reduce domestic violence."" Gary Kleck, a criminology professor at Florida State University, said Everytown’s figure ""takes no other account of any other factors that affect homicides."" ""States do not randomly pass gun laws -- those that pass gun laws are different in many ways from those that do not,"" Kleck, who has studied the impact of background checks on homicide rates, said in an email.  ""For obvious political reasons, it’s easier to enact stricter gun laws in states with fewer gun-owning voters. Thus, states that extended background checks to private gun transfers had lower gun ownership rates even before those laws were passed. Likewise, states with stricter gun laws are more urban, less likely to be Southern or Western (and thus culturally different), more politically liberal etc. You can’t isolate the effect of a gun law without controlling for other violence-related factors."" Our ruling Haas said in states with comprehensive background checks for handguns, ""49 percent fewer women are shot and killed."" She supports that statement by pointing to figures examining a narrower group of female firearms victims -- those killed in domestic violence situations. But figures examining the broader group of victims she cited in her statement -- women in general -- show 38 percent fewer women were shot and killed in the states with private-sale background checks on handgun sales. That’s not quite high as the figure she cited, but it still represents a lower rate of gun homicides of women in states with comprehensive background checks. But experts cautioned against reading too much into that correlation. They noted that there may be other factors beyond background checks that led to that result",Half True,"February 16, 2015"

And we saw this on another department web page about Texas hunting regulations: ""Black bears are protected and cannot be hunted or killed."" Separately to our inquiry, Jon English, an attorney for the Texas District and County Attorneys Association, said the second-floor window claim reminded him of another myth about Texas barring hunters from firing at buffalo from the second story of a hotel. Similarly, a librarian at the Legislative Reference Library in the Texas Capitol replied by email that its researchers didn’t find evidence of a law restricting bear-shooting from the second story. We identified one instance in which a person may shoot a bear in Texas. Under the state’s penal code, it’s a defense to prosecution for a person to shoot a dangerous wild animal, including a bear, in a public place if they have reasonable fear of bodily injury. Our ruling Hastings said a Texas law says ""that you can’t shoot bears out of the second floor of a window."" We failed to learn where he heard or read this. His contention that Texas is so crazy that it has a second-floor bear-shooting law is flat wrong. Texas has no such law. Instead, it forbids hunting of bears, a protected species regardless of the windows they're standing under. From the windowed second floor of the Austin American-Statesman’s building, we find this claim incorrect and ridiculous",False Pants on Fire,"February 12, 2015"
"Ronald Reagan ""banned ownership of fully automatic rifles. He supported the assault weaspons ban.""","Del. Alfonso Lopez recently conjured the spirit of Ronald Reagan in an ill-fated attempt to convince the Republican-led House of Delegates to pass gun control legislation. ""In Virginia, we have a bad habit of defeating every single sensible gun violence prevention bill proposal,"" Lopez, D-Arlington, lamented in a Jan. 19 floor speech. ""By the standards of today, Ronald Reagan was a traitor to the Second Amendment,"" Lopez said. The delegate added about Reagan, ""As president, he banned ownership of fully automatic rifles. He supported the assault weapons ban..."" We wondered whether Lopez described the Gipper’s record correctly. We asked the delegate for proof of his claim and he sent an assortment of newspaper articles, two op-ed pieces Reagan wrote after his presidency, and a 2013 Truth-O-Meter by PolitiFact Georgia on a similar claim about Reagan. Let’s start by recalling that Reagan was shot in the chest in a 1981 assassination attempt that left his press secretary, James Brady, with a gunshot wound to the head and permanent brain damage. During the rest of his administration, which ended in 1989, Reagan ""often expressed opposition to national gun control laws,"" according to a 1994 article in The New York Times. Shortly after his shooting, he said he was ""a little disturbed"" that people were ""focusing on gun control as an answer to the crime problem today."" Lopez pointed out to us that in 1986, Reagan signed the Firearm Owners Protection Act. The bill provided a number of protections for gun owners. But it also barred the private sale and ownership of any fully automatic rifles -- machine guns -- that were not already registered with the federal government on the day Reagan signed the law. The provision, still in effect today, is not the outright ban that Lopez described. Private citizens remain free to buy and transfer machine guns that were registered prior to May 20, 1986 -- provided they pass a background check, receive signed approval from their local police chief or sheriff and pay a $200 federal tax. There are 512,790 registered machine guns in the United States, according to a 2014 report by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Virginia was home to 31,825 of them, more than any state. Now, let’s move to the assertion that Reagan also backed a ban on assault weapons, which are often described as semi-automatic firearms with detachable magazines and pistol grips. They are capable of firing many rounds without reloading, but the trigger has to be pulled for each shot. Lopez referred us to a May 1994 letter signed by Reagan and former Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter urging members of the U.S. House of Representatives to to support a pending bill banning assault weapons. They wrote, ""While we recognize that assault weapon legislation will not stop all assault weapon crime, statistics prove that we can dry up the supply of these guns, making them less accessible to criminals. We urge you to listen to the American public and to the law enforcement community and support a ban on the further manufacture of these weapons."" Reagan also sent a personal note that month to one of the fence sitters on ban: Rep. Scott Klug, R-WI. ""I know there is heavy pressure on you to go the other way, but I strongly urge you to join me in supporting this bill,"" he wrote. It must be passed."" The measure cleared Congress, with Klug’s support, and was signed by then-President. Bill Clinton. The assault weapons ban expired in 2004 when Congress refused to extend it. We should note that since Lopez’s speech, the General Assembly has killed a number of gun control bills, including legislation by Lopez that would have restricted the sale and ownership of high-capacity firearm magazines. Our ruling Lopez said, ""As president, (Reagan) banned ownership of fully automatic rifles. He supported the assault weapons ban."" Lopez errs in saying Reagan banned ownership of machine guns. Reagan, in 1986, signed a law that barred the private sale and ownership of machine guns that were not already registered on the day he signed the bill. The measure stopped new machine guns from entering the private marketplace, it did not ban the old ones. Lopez is correct on the second part of his claim. In 1994, after his presidency, Reagan signed a letter urging the House to pass an assault weapons ban",Half True,"February 4, 2015"
"Assault weapons and handguns are allowed in the state Capitol while bullhorns, trumpets, helium balloons and flags on poles are banned.","House Democrats in the General Assembly have launched a petition drive to show public support for a package of pending gun control bills. The online entreaty calls for ""common sense gun laws"" and, to foster the contention that Virginia’s firearm policies are awry, contains a white and blue graphic of some of the rules regarding public entrance to the state capitol. On the left side of the graphic is the headline ""Banned in the Virginia State Capitol."" Underneath are pictures of a bullhorn, a trumpet, a floating helium balloon and an American flag on a pole. The right side says, ""Allowed in the Virginia State Capitol."" Underneath are pictures of a handgun, a rifle, and two assault guns. ""How does this make sense?"" the bottom of the chart asks in capital letters. We wondered whether the petition accurately described the rules for entry into the Capitol.  David Pourshoushtari, a spokesman for the House Democrats, pointed us to visitors’ rules posted on the General Assembly’s website. The House and the Senate have identical rules for general entry into the Capitol. The conditions vary slightly for entry into galleries in each chamber. Let’s take a look. Bullhorns, trumpets and balloons. The basic rules for entering the Capitol are spelled out in these words on the legislative website: ""Possession or use of any device that may disrupt the conduct of business is prohibited, including, but not limited to: voice-amplification equipment; bullhorns; blow horns; sirens, or other noise-producing devices as well as signs on sticks, poles or stakes, or helium-filled balloons."" That confirms two of four items Democrats said were banned. But what about trumpets? Susan Schaar, the Senate clerk, said they would generally not be allowed since they fall into the realm of ""noise-producing devices."" Schaar said exceptions can be made, such as for a memorial service. Paul Nardo, the House clerk, said flags are allowed to be brought into the building, but not if they’re hoisted on poles. The image on the Democrat’s petition shows a flag on a pole. Nardo explained that the rules apply to everyone, including members of the legislature as well as the general public. Firearms We couldn’t find any rules about bringing guns into the Capitol on the General Assembly’s website. But they do exist. Capt. Randy Howard of the Virginia Division of Capitol Police said firearms access into the Capitol is governed by  rules passed in 2004 by a joint legislative committee. He told us possession is limited to three groups: General Assembly members, law enforcement officials and any holder of a valid concealed handgun permit. Could someone bring an assault rifle into the Capitol? If he is allowed to bring in a firearm, the answer is yes, Howard said. The 2004 rule ""simply says ‘firearm’, so it’s fairly broad,"" Howard told us. ""It doesn’t just say that the only thing they can bring in is a handgun even though that’s what’s covered by the (concealed) handgun permit."" Del. Joseph Morrissey, I-Henrico, held aloft an unloaded AK-47 in the House chamber during a 2013 debate over a gun control measure he sponsored. Morrissey said then that the weapon had been inspected by the Capitol police prior to being brought into the chamber, according to an article in the Richmond Times-Dispatch. The Senate bans firearms in its public gallery looking over the chamber’s floor. There is no such restriction in the House gallery. Our ruling Calling for reform to Virginia’s gun laws, House Democrats noted that firearms -- including assault rifles -- are allowed to be brought in the state Capitol while helium balloons, flags on poles, trumpets and bullhorns are banned. The list of barred articles holds up. The firearms issue is a bit trickier. They can be brought into the Capitol, but only by lawmakers, valid concealed weapons permit holders and law enforcement. They are banned in the Senate gallery",Mostly True,"January 26, 2015"
"On assault weapon violence: ""Ducks have more protection than people in Virginia.""","When it comes to protection from assault weapons in Virginia, Del. Alfonso Lopez said ducks have it better than people. Lopez, D-Arlington, has introduced a bill that would ban the future sale in Virginia of gun magazines that hold more than 20 bullets. It has a grandfather clause that would allow those who owned higher-capacity magazines prior to the signing of his bill to keep three of the devices. The grandfathered owners would have to register those magazines with the state police. In a Jan. 19 floor speech, Lopez said his bill is a response to mass shootings around the nation in recent years, including the 2007 Virginia Tech tragedy that left 32 dead and 17 wounded. Then, the delegate made an analogy to hunting. ""Since 1931, federal law prohibits me from having more than three shotgun shells in my shotgun when I’m duck hunting,"" he said. ""That means that ducks have more protection than people in Virginia. ""Let me repeat that: Under the law, ducks have more protection than people in Virginia,"" Lopez said. We took a gander at Lopez’s claim. The delegate referred us to federal and state hunting laws. They identically make it illegal to hunt migratory birds with a shotgun capable of firing more than three rounds without reloading. Does that mean ducks are better protected than people under Virginia laws? The very premise of Lopez’s claim is flawed. It’s legal to hunt ducks in Virginia. If you shoot one with a barred firearm for duck hunting, it’s a misdemeanor punishable by a maximum $500 fine. It’s illegal to shoot people in Virginia with any firearm, except in limited instances of self defense. The murder of person in Virginia is punishable by death or lengthy prison sentences. There’s no jail time for shooting a duck, even if it’s done with an illegal shotgun. It’s illegal to even point a gun at another person in Virginia in a menacing way, a misdemeanor punishable by up to a year in prison and a $2,500 fine. State law is silent about pointing a gun at a duck. Lopez told us he wasn’t trying to argue that Virginia laws protect ducks better than people from being shot. ""I was talking about  the number of bullets and shotgun shells,"" he said, adding that, perhaps, he could have been clearer in his speech. ""I was talking about high capacity guns."" Our ruling In a speech on the House floor, Lopez said that under Virginia law ""ducks have more protection that people"" from assault gun violence. To drive the point home, he repeated it. There’s simply no basis to this jarring claim. Virginia sanctions duck hunting; it’s a misdemeanor with no jail time if you shoot one with a gun that can hold more than three bullets. It’s a felony to purposefully shoot a person, sometimes punishable by death, and the capacity of firearms doesn’t alter this simple fact",False Pants on Fire,"January 26, 2015"
"Georgia has had 12 school shootings in the two years since the mass killing at Sandy Hook Elementary School, more than any other state.","Georgia has had the nation’s highest unemployment rate for three straight months. Now a new report puts Georgia at the top of another undesirable ranking: leading the nation with 12 school shootings since the mass killing at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported the Everytown for Gun Safety findings when they were first released last week. But a follow-up story noted concerns that PolitiFact found in previous Everytown school shooting report, centered on the group’s overly broad definition of a school shooting. PolitiFact Georgia decided to review the latest report, and our previous work, to see if the new ranking holds up. At issue is what counts as a ""school shooting."" Everytown is very transparent about its methodology and criteria which go beyond the common understanding that a school shooting is an intruder or student shooting at innocent classmates and staff. The group counts those incidents, such as the Sandy Hook massacre that left 28 dead. But it expands to other incidents, according to the report’s footnotes: ""Incidents were classified as school shootings when a firearm was discharged inside a school building or on school or campus grounds, as documented by the press or confirmed through further inquiries with law enforcement. Incidents in which guns were brought into schools but not fired, or were fired off school grounds after having been possessed in schools, were not included. "" In other words, Everytown is counting incidents where no one is killed and even accidental discharges as school shootings. That’s how, for instance, the 12 incidents in Georgia include a 17-year-old student who accidentally shot herself with an illegally concealed firearm in a February 2013 incident at Grady High School. Also added to the tally: what turned out to be a suicide attempt in May in the parking deck of Georgia Gwinnett College. Only one incident counted in the more commonly understood definition: the August 2013 morning when Michael Brandon Hill stormed McNair Discovery Learning Academy in DeKalb County armed with an AK-47 style semi-automatic rifle and nearly 500 rounds of ammunition. A school bookkeeper, Antoinette Tuff, talked down the man who had shot his way into the 800-student school. She, and a heavy police response, convinced Hill to surrender without injuring anyone – an outcome that drew international headlines. Experts warned about the confusion of putting those kinds of attacks – and two other shootings during school hours or school events following confrontations – in with other incidents. ""The question is whether the entire school or campus is endangered by the episode. The answer is most of these cases is no,"" said James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University in Boston and author of the book, ""Violence and Security on Campus: From preschool through college."" But without knowing that, the report could drive anxiety and fear amid parents and students when schools are actually among the safest places for children to be, Fox said. There were consistently about 45 school-associated violent deaths (not just by guns) in K-12 schools annually between 1992 and 2010. The number plunged to 31 in 2011, after spiking at 63 in the 2007 school year, according to a U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics report. The Southeast, not just Georgia, often sees more of the incidents because of easier access to guns, Fox said. But a two-year snapshot does not offer any meaningful analysis, he added. Shootings on college campuses, meanwhile, are yet another different type of incident. Alcohol is often a factor in those incidents, which the Everytown report and experts conclude are often the result of an escalating conflict. Those shootings are no less tragic for stemming from confrontations, but experts said that also shows the different circumstances than the image of a lone shooter gunning down victims indiscriminately. ""That kind of personal altercation happens in a variety of locations. People are in a bar, get in a fight and go get a gun from their car,"" said Mark Safarik, president of Forensic Behavioral Services Inc. and a former member of the FBI Behavioral Analysis Unit. ""You’ve really broadened it to the point where it loses the sense that you are trying to get,"" he added. Everytown defends its definition, noting it includes on the first page of the report its criteria for the report. ""Our definition of what qualifies as a school shooting could not possibly be any more straightforward. When a gun is shot on school grounds, that's a school shooting,"" said Everytown communications director Erika Soto Lamb. ""Plain and simple -- any challenge to this very obvious definition deserves to be called what it is: a case of 'pants on fire.’"" The experts disagree. But, the group can take heart in one key element of its findings and how it may play out in Georgia. The report concludes that more than a third of all shootings nationally occurred after an argument or confrontation. Two-thirds of the Georgia incidents involved a shooter and victim who knew each other, an argument or fight beforehand or a drug deal. That helps make the case for keeping guns off of college campuses, a fight expected to be revived when the Legislature convenes next month. ""In a lot of these incidents, a fight occurs and it’s settled with a gun,"" Safarik said. ""You add in college campuses, with alcohol consumption, it could be a recipe for more events. That should be a more important conclusion than a dubious conclusion Georgia has the most school shootings."" And with that, it appears the new Everytown report on school shootings mirrors concerns raised before about how to tally school shootings. It is accurate, by its broad definition, that Georgia led the nation with its version of ""school shootings."" The report is also useful in explaining what often leads to violent incidents at school and college campuses. In the end, there is value in the findings but significant context missing from its overall conclusion",Mostly False,"December 19, 2014"
"Says 3,000 Americans ""died of gunfire"" between the time of the Ebola scare in Dallas and the midterm elections.","A day before PolitiFact unveiled that exaggerations about Ebola took top honors as the 2014 Lie of the Year, the comic strip Doonesbury took aim at the very same target. The strip’s author Garry Trudeau imagined an interview between his characters NPR host Mark Slackmeyer, and Fox News correspondent Roland Hedley. Hedley: We’re very proud of our Ebola unit. We covered Obama’s bungling of the epidemic from the Dallas debacle to the election. Slackmeyer: Have any idea how many Americans died from Ebola during that time? Hedley: Um ... No. I’d have to run the numbers on that. Slackmeyer: None. Not a single one. Want to know how many died of gunfire during that same period? Hedley: I don’t see how that’s relevant. Slackmeyer: Statistically, about 3,000. For the record, Trudeau is correct about the number of Americans who died from Ebola. The two people who succumbed on American soil were not American citizens. But we wanted to take a closer look at Trudeau’s statement that ""statistically, about 3,000"" people died of gunfire between the events in Dallas and the November election. That word ""statistically"" struck us as a particularly careful choice. To refresh your memory, Thomas Eric Duncan was admitted to a Dallas hospital on Sept. 28. Duncan ultimately died and then two nurses who treated him contracted the disease. They both survived. The election took place on Nov. 4. Trudeau explained to us that he based his number on annual deaths due to guns that he found on a website run by the School of Public Health at the University of Sydney in Australia.  The yearly totals only went through 2011 so Trudeau looked back five years and took the lowest number.  He divided to find the weekly average and used that for the five weeks between Duncan becoming ill and the election. ""It's obviously only a statistically typical five-week period,"" Trudeau said. ""For all I know there could have been a major lull in gun violence in October. But for purposes of argumentative contrast, I felt it accurately reflected the magnitude of harm our epidemic of gun violence inflicts."" Using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s aptly named Wonder database, we found monthly numbers that ran through 2012. For simplicity, we summed deaths for October and the first four days of November. This approach was slightly more precise than Trudeau’s and as this table shows, it more than confirmed Trudeau’s claim. (Adding a few days in September would only make the case stronger.) Year October Nov. (4 days) Total 2012 2,733 364 3,097 2011 2,748 344 3,092 2010 2,725 336 3,061 2009 2,655 333 2,988 2008 2,626 339 2,965 Average 3,041 We don’t know exactly how many people died over that time period in 2014, and we won’t know for about a year. But Trudeau’s figure is very much in line with past trends, and as Trudeau noted to us, the numbers have been stable for many years. Suicide looms large The most important caveat to Trudeau’s statement is that it includes suicides. In 2012, the CDC classified 20,666 deaths as due to ""intentional self-harm"" by any sort of firearm. The number of deaths by assault, or what we might call homicide? 11,622. Gun violence is an umbrella term that covers all manner of deaths when a weapon is fired. It includes suicide, criminal homicide, police shootings, cases when the intent is unknown, and a strange category called ""exposure to inanimate mechanical force - firearm."" When you hear about gun violence, it might suggest solely people killing each other. That would be inaccurate. Roughly two-thirds of the deaths are people killing themselves. Also, the CDC data records the death of residents, but it doesn’t track their citizenship status. Trudeau contrasted gun deaths with the deaths of Americans due to Ebola. We found no information that made the distinction. A note about Fox News While Fox News devoted many minutes if not hours to Ebola coverage, and not always with pinpoint accuracy, on Oct. 15 host Shepard Smith delivered a 4-minute monologue saying that fear of Ebola is ""not based in fact or reason."" Smith decried the tendency of politicians and news organizations to hype the hysteria. Our ruling Garry Trudeau, speaking through his characters in Doonesbury, said that in the time between the Ebola scare in Dallas and the election, ""statistically"" about 3,000 Americans died from gunfire. The latest data from the CDC bears that out. Using a five-year average, we found 3,041 deaths in the relevant time period. Given that the debate over gun deaths in this country often centers on homicides or accidental shootings, it is important to note that about two-thirds of the total would likely be suicides. Plus, the CDC data counts the deaths of residents, which might include some noncitizens. Still, the number of deaths is in line with what Trudeau said, even if the precise figures will vary. The claim is accurate but it requires some clarification",Mostly True,"December 18, 2014"
"""The NRA supported background checks...""","Fairfax County voters next month will replace Republican Del. Barbara Comstock, who won the 10th District congressional seat this fall. Democrat Kathleen Murphy recently launched a bid for the seat Comstock will leave in the state legislature. In a three-page platform, Murphy calls for ""reasonable"" gun regulations and explains her position in personal terms. ""I lost my brother to gun violence,"" she wrote. ""Two gunmen robbed and murdered him. He was the father of five young children..."" Murphy said she wants to close the ""gun show loophole"" through which people can buy guns from private gun sellers without a background check. She suggested that even the National Rifle Association could back that proposal. ""The NRA supported background checks after the tragedy of 9-11,"" she wrote on her website. We wondered if Murphy’s statement was correct. After we asked, Morgan Finkelstein, spokeswoman for the Democratic Party of Virginia, told us Murphy made a mistake. The candidate had meant to say the NRA supported background checks after the 1999 shootings at Columbine High School in Littleton, Co. that killed 13. That was two years before the World Trade Center attack. Murphy promptly took down the statement from her website. A few days later, she replaced it with the statement, ""The NRA supported background checks after the tragedy at Columbine High School."" Rather than haggle over when the NRA might have supported background checks, we decided to examine the key issue raised by Murphy: Did the NRA ever support background checks? Our colleagues at PolitiFact national looked at similar claims that were made last year by President Barack Obama and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. The statements were based on congressional testimony by NRA executive vice president Wayne LaPierre on May 27, 1999 -- five weeks after the Columbine shootings. ""We think it’s reasonable to provide mandatory instant criminal background checks for every sale at every gun show. No loopholes anywhere for anyone,"" LaPierre told the House Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Crime. ""That means closing the Hinckley loophole so the records of those adjudicated mentally ill are in the system. This isn’t new, or a change of position, or a concession. I’ve been on the record on this point consistently, from our national meeting in Denver, to paid national ads and positions papers, to news interviews and press appearances."" At the time, Congress was considering legislation to expand background checks. LaPierre outlined a series of proposals that the NRA found ""reasonable,"" including ""instant background checks."" But the crux of his testimony was that he found provisions of the legislation unreasonable, such as the way the bill defined a gun show, how it allowed a three-business day period for background checks of potential gun buyers, and that the instant background check system didn’t destroy records of guns sales immediately. The NRA eventually backed a substitute proposal that would have expanded background checks. The bill extended the requirement, which affected only licensed firearm dealers, to individuals selling their personally-owned weapons at gun shows. But in return for closing the loophole, the NRA-backed bill shortened the time for completing background checks to 24 hours. That led to the death of the bill, with opponents saying the 24-hour deadline would drastically weaken the checks. The Washington Post Fact Checker wrote last year that the NRA’s background check proposal was so limited that many control advocates concluded it was a ""sham."" LaPierre’s testimony came up again last year amid the gun control debate that unfolded after shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newton, Conn. that killed 26. In a January 2013 interview, CNN Anchor Anderson Cooper read LaPierre’s testimony and asked Sandy Froman, an NRA board member, whether the group had changed its mind on background checks. ""Yes, the NRA has changed its position, and the reason it changed its position is because the system doesn’t work. The (National Instant Criminal Background Check) system is not working now. We have to get that working before we can add any more checks to that system. It’s already overburdened,"" Froman said. ""Let’s get it working. Let’s make sure that the 23 states that aren’t reporting the names of people who are mentally ill and have violent tendencies, let’s get those reported and into the system and then we can take a look."" Our ruling Murphy said the NRA once supported background checks. It’s correct that LaPierre, the group’s executive director, did testify after the 1999 Columbine tragedy that the NRA supported ""mandatory instant criminal background checks for every sale."" But Murphy’s version of that event is rosy. There were caveats to LaPierre’s statement and many gun control advocates later that year would accuse the NRA of scuttling legislation to expand background tests. So Murphy’s statement is accurate, but needs more information",Mostly True,"November 24, 2014"
Georgia ranks No. 9 in the rate of women murdered by men.,"Anyone who follows the constant drum beat of crime news in metro Atlanta might not be surprised by a new study that puts Georgia among the most dangerous states for a very specific crime: women who are murdered by men. A Violence Policy Center report released in September shows Georgia ranks ninth among all states, with a homicide rate of 1.66 per 100,000 women in 2012, the last year data is available. The national rate is 1.16 per 100,000. ""We call on Georgia’s lawmakers to make it an urgent priority to keep guns away from domestic abusers and protect women from harm,"" Kathryn Grant, co-founder of GunSense Georgia said in a statement related to the study. ""This is literally a matter of life and death."" PolitiFact Georgia wanted to know if our state really ranks that high on the list for women murdered by men. We went straight to the website for the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Supplementary Homicide Reports. That data showed Georgia had 102 homicides in 2012 – 19 percent more than the 84 tallied in the Violence Policy Center report. The VPC’s study has a lower overall number because it takes that data and then weeds out crimes with more than one victim or perpetrator, said VPC policy analyst Marty Langley, who authored the report. An analysis of the SHR data, available only in hard copy from the FBI, confirms those numbers are accurate for incidents where one woman is killed by one man. James Alan Fox, a Northeastern University criminology professor who has studied and analyzed such data for decades, said the adjustment oversimplifies the information. Taking a more narrow slice of victims also allows for further analysis of their characteristics such as age (the victim in Georgia was 38) and race (51 were black and 30 were white in Georgia). And for homicides where the data could be found, 69 percent of victims were killed with guns and 93 percent of them were murdered by someone they knew, the study found. ""An overarching point we want to make with this study is that it’s a myth that a woman’s risk of homicide comes from being attacked by a stranger,"" said Kristen Rand, the group’s legislative director. ""The risk of stranger homicide is really quite low."" But missing from the report is another key fact: the risk of homicide in Georgia is among the highest for any victims. It’s easier to see in lists:   Rank State   2012 Homicide Rate per 100,000,  Females Murdered by Males 1 Alaska 2.57 2 South Carolina 2.06 3 Oklahoma 2.03 4 Louisiana 1.92 5 Mississippi 1.89 6 Nevada 1.83 7 Missouri 1.73 8 Arizona 1.70 9 Georgia 1.66 10 Tennessee 1.60 (Source: Violence Policy Center)   Rank State 2012 Homicide Rate  per 100,000, Overall 1 Louisiana 10.8 2 Mississippi 7.4 3 Alabama 7.1 4 Michigan 7.0 5 South Carolina 6.9 6 Missouri 6.5 7 Maryland 6.3 8 Delaware 6.2 9 Tennessee 6.0 10 (tie) Arkansas, Georgia 5.9 (Source: Bureau of Justice Statistics)   Southern states such as Georgia dominate both lists, Fox said, because of factors beyond gender. Gun ownership rates are higher here. The South also has a long history of  people solving personal conflicts with violence versus lawsuits, Fox said. And, he added, the region is also more diverse than much of the country, and murder rates by and against blacks are higher than those among whites. ""The fact that most of the states on (the VPC) list are in the south is not so much an issue of male-female violence,"" Fox said. ""It’s about homicide, generally."" In summary, the data bears out the study’s findings that rank Georgia ninth in the nation for the rate of women killed by men. One caveat is that tally counts only single victims and perpetrators. It ignores some crimes it hopes to draw attention to, such as a former partner killing a woman before committing suicide or a man killing his ex-partner and a new love interest, if there are two victims. More importantly, the tally also fails to acknowledge Georgia’s dismal rank for the risk of homicide overall, and the other factors that contribute to it. The numbers are right, but it’s also true that there is more to the story",True,"November 19, 2014"
"The ""stand your ground"" law caused the shooting death of Trayvon Martin.","The shooting death of Trayvon Martin in Florida, which sparked a national discussion about ""stand your ground"" laws, has become ammunition in the North Carolina U.S. Senate race. The Senate Majority PAC, which aims to elect Democrats, ran a radio ad urging higher turnout among black voters. The ad attacks Thom Tillis, the Republican speaker of the North Carolina House, challenging Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan. The ad makes a series of claims about Tillis including this one: ""Tillis even led the effort to pass the type of ‘stand your ground’ laws that caused the shooting death of Trayvon Martin."" PolitiFact has fact-checked numerous claims related to the Trayvon Martin case. Did Florida’s ""stand your ground"" law cause his death? The radio ad was captured by the conservative blogger SisterToldjah and sparked considerable media attention. It prompted a conservative group to counterattack with a radio ad accusing the Democrats of ""race baiting."" While we are focused on the claim about whether Florida’s ""stand your ground"" law killed Trayvon, other media reports dissected Tillis’ role in the North Carolina law, which Tillis voted in favor of. Trayvon Martin and ""stand your ground"" law The fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin of Miami Gardens on Feb. 26, 2012, and the acquittal of George Zimmerman the following year ignited political debate over race, gun rights and Florida’s ""stand your ground"" law. The law, which was approved overwhelmingly by the Legislature and signed by Gov. Jeb Bush in 2005, allows people to use deadly force when they believe their life is at risk. The law, promoted by the National Rifle Association, now exists in about two dozen states. Trayvon, a black 17-year-old, was returning from a convenience store and walking through a gated neighborhood where he was staying with his father. Zimmerman, a white-Hispanic neighborhood watchman, called a non-emergency police number to report Trayvon as ""suspicious."" A violent struggle followed and Zimmerman shot and killed Trayvon. Zimmerman waived his right to a ""stand your ground"" hearing before trial, and did not cite it in his defense during the trial. But the law was cited in jury instructions: ""If George Zimmerman was not engaged in an unlawful activity and was attacked in any place where he had a right to be, he had no duty to retreat and had the right to stand his ground and meet force with force, including deadly force if he reasonably believed that it was necessary to do so to prevent death or great bodily harm to himself or another or to prevent the commission of a forcible felony."" In July 2013, the jury found Zimmerman not guilty of second-degree murder. After the verdict, Dan Gelber, a former federal prosecutor and state legislator from Miami Beach who was a critic of the law in 2005, wrote on his blog that jurors would have received different instructions under the old law, which said: ""The defendant cannot justify the use of force likely to cause death or great bodily harm unless he used every reasonable means within his power and consistent with his own safety to avoid the danger before resorting to that force The fact that the defendant was wrongfully attacked cannot justify his use of force likely to cause death or great bodily harm if by retreating he could have avoided the need to use that force."" (Gelber is now an adviser to Charlie Crist’s Democratic campaign for governor in Florida.) It’s difficult to quantify what extent ""stand your ground"" law played in the jury’s decision. One juror told CNN’s Anderson Cooper that the jury discussed the ""stand your ground"" law. ""It became very confusing. We had stuff thrown at us. We had the second-degree murder charge, the manslaughter charge, then we had self-defense, ‘stand your ground,’ and I think there was one other one."" The juror, who was unnamed, said the murder or manslaughter charge did not apply ""because of the heat of the moment and the ‘stand your ground.’ "" But while the ""stand your ground"" law could have played a role for the jury, the law itself didn’t pull the trigger in the shooting. It’s impossible to fully evaluate Zimmerman’s thinking when he shot Trayvon, but one factor could have been that Zimmerman was a wannabe cop -- he had been rejected for a job with the Prince William County, Va.,  police department. Racial profiling could have played a role; Trayvon was a black male teenager wearing a hoodie. And then we will mention the obvious: Zimmerman had a gun. Zimmerman said in a TV interview in 2012 he had never heard of ""stand your ground"" until after the shooting, though during the trial the prosecution presented evidence that Zimmerman took a criminal-litigation course in which the instructor said he covered the ""stand your ground"" law. Zimmerman received an ""A"" in the course in 2010. The Senate Majority PAC’s back-up for the ad cites an article in Mother Jones shortly after the acquittal, which points to Zimmerman taking that course: ""In reality, ‘stand your ground’ played a major role, from Martin's death to Zimmerman's acquittal. ... An armed Zimmerman knew about ‘stand your ground’ years ago."" A spokesman for the PAC, Ty Matsdorf, didn’t respond to PolitiFact’s questions other than sending us the ad backup. He gave a statement to the New York Times defending the ad in general terms. But two defense attorneys we interviewed argued that the ""stand your ground"" law itself didn’t play a provable role. ""I don’t recall any evidence that he made a conscious decision to rely on the law before acting,"" said Kendall Coffey, a former U.S. Attorney in Miami now in private practice. "" ‘Stand your ground’ may have led to the acquittal of George Zimmerman; that’s a more accurate statement. It’s led to other acquittals, too."" ""The law didn’t cause his death,"" said David Weinstein, a former state and federal prosecutor and now a Miami defense attorney. ""The bullet that got fired by George Zimmerman’s gun is what caused Trayvon Martin’s death."" After the Trayvon case, efforts to get rid of Florida’s ""stand your ground"" law went nowhere in the Republican-led Legislature. In fact, in 2014 the Legislature added that it applies to warning shots. The law has remained a hot topic nationwide, including in Florida’s race between Republican Gov. Rick Scott and Crist. During the Oct. 15 debate at Broward College, Scott said he would not change the law, while Crist said it is ""fundamentally flawed"" and needs to be fixed. Our ruling A Senate Majority PAC radio ad said, ""Tillis even led the effort to pass the type of ‘stand your ground’ laws that caused the shooting death of Trayvon Martin."" The part we focused on is whether Florida’s ""stand your ground"" law killed Trayvon. There are plenty of factors that could have contributed to George Zimmerman shooting Trayvon including racial profiling and his desire to be a law enforcement officer (not to mention the obvious: his access to a gun). And the ""stand your ground"" law could have influenced the jury’s decision to acquit Zimmerman of murder. However, it is an overstatement to suggest that the law is to blame for Trayvon’s death",False,"October 30, 2014"
"""Obama, instead of nominating a health professional, he nominated someone who is an anti-gun activist (for surgeon general).""","The lack of a surgeon general -- the federal government’s top public health spokesperson -- has become a point of contention as the public panics about Ebola. Sen. Ted Cruz said President Barack Obama is to blame for the fact that the position hasn’t been filled. ""Look, of course we should have a surgeon general in place,"" Cruz, R-Texas, said on CNN’s State of the Union Oct. 19. ""And we don’t have one because President Obama, instead of nominating a health professional, he nominated someone who is an anti-gun activist."" Obama nominated Dr. Vivek Murthy in November 2013, but Senate Republicans blocked his confirmation the following spring because of alleged anti-gun leanings. The National Rifle Association, which scores policymakers’ records on gun rights, announced that it would ding senators who voted for Murthy. CNN’s Candy Crowley pushed back on Cruz’s assertion, noting that Murthy is a doctor. Cruz acknowledged that, but repeated his original point: ""He is a doctor, but where he’s made his name is as a crusader against Second Amendment rights."" It’s up for debate how much of an impact the surgeon general would have in the current Ebola situation. But it’s bogus for Cruz to imply that Murthy -- a graduate of Yale School of Medicine -- is not primarily a health professional. It’s also a bit of a stretch to call Murthy an ""anti-gun activist."" A career in public health Here are some of Murthy’s credentials as a health professional: Received his doctor of medicine degree in 2003 from the Yale School of Medicine; Is a physician and Harvard Medical School instructor at Boston’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital, one of the best hospitals in the country; Has contributed to vaccine development and cancer research published in several medical journals, including the Journal of the American Medical Association, Science, and the Journal of the National Cancer Institute; Co-founded TrialNetworks, which provides medical researchers with information technology systems for managing clinical trials; Member of the U.S. Presidential Advisory Council on Prevention, Health Promotion and Integrative and Public Health. Also of note: As a student, Murthy co-founded two India-based public health projects, one while as an undergraduate at Harvard University and the other while at Yale. The first focused on AIDS prevention, and the latter trained women in rural areas to address community health issues. Political leanings Where Murthy starts to get in hot water with Republicans is with Doctors for America, which he founded and currently heads. Doctors for America is a pro-Affordable Care Act health care reform advocacy group. They started out in 2008 as Doctors for Obama, an arm of the Obama presidential campaign. Doctors for America’s primary cause is health care reform and expanding access to medical services. However, the group also considers gun violence a public health problem, and they have pushed gun control legislation. At a 2013 conference, they held a reducing gun violence workshop. Of particular concern for the NRA is a letter Doctors for America sent to Congress Jan. 14, 2013, following the Sandy Hook school shooting. Murthy’s signature is on the letter. The letter lays out several policy suggestions, including a ban on assault weapon sales, instituting universal background checks and removing laws that prohibit doctors from asking patients if they own a gun -- similar to other Doctors for America proposals. These policy proposals are relatively mainstream and expected from someone who is a political ally to the president. They are also similar to policies supported by other medical associations, such as the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics. But the NRA has painted the Doctors for America policy proposals as radical. The NRA and Senate Republicans also made hay with Murthy’s Twitter. In 2012 and 2013, he tweeted occasionally about gun violence -- expressing plainly that he believes in more gun control and that he considers it a health care issue.   But does this mean he’d be an advocate for gun control as surgeon general? When we asked Cruz's office for comment, spokesperson Catherine Frazier told us this: ""It is wrong to cherry-pick one line out of context from the argument that Sen. Cruz was making, which is that the president’s nominee is no mere health professional, he is a liberal activist that has indicated he would use his position to further a gun control agenda. Both Republicans and Democrats have voiced concern over the nomination."" In Murthy’s opening statement at his surgeon general confirmation hearing, though, he listed other public health issues as priorities -- including obesity (his stated primary cause), vaccine-preventable diseases and tobacco use. He did not mention gun control. Later in the hearing, Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., read aloud one of Murthy’s tweets. In response, Murthy said he would not use the surgeon general role as a ""bully pulpit for gun control."" He added: ""The role is not to be a legislator or a judge. The role is to be a public health educator and to bring the country together around our most pressing health care challenges, and I believe at this point that obesity is the defining public health challenge of our time. That is where I intend to put my primary focus."" Our ruling Cruz said, ""President Obama, instead of nominating a health professional, he nominated someone who is an anti-gun activist."" Murthy has a long list of credentials showing he is a health professional, including his position as an attending physician at a leading hospital. Murthy runs a health care reform organization that has pushed for gun control measures, and he has expressed personal support for gun control. But enacting gun control is not Murthy’s main cause and not part of his public surgeon general platform. It’s no secret that Murthy is a political ally for Obama and backs his positions on gun control. But it's inaccurate to say he's an anti-gun activist but not a health care professional",False,"October 23, 2014"
"Republicans ""made it easier to buy a gun"" in states they won in 2010.","If the polls are to be believed, most voters are approaching the upcoming midterm elections with less zest than in the past. Republicans hold the enthusiasm edge over Democrats, but their advantage is about half as big compared to 2010, when they made major gains at the state and federal levels. Still, Republicans are poised to do well and liberal columnist Mark Shields warned about the consequences of GOP victories. ""When the Republicans swept all these statehouses and state legislatures (in 2010), they did two things,"" Shields said on Oct. 10 on PBS’ Newshour. ""They made it easier to buy a gun and tougher to vote."" The part about gun purchases caught a reader’s ear and she asked if Shields had it right, so in this fact-check, we see what happened to the laws about buying guns after 2010. To cut to the chase, relatively modest changes took place in few states. But we found no evidence that Republicans across the country made sweeping changes to make it easier to purchase a firearm. According the National Conference of State Legislatures, 16 states saw at least one legislative chamber or a governorship shift from Democratic to Republican control. Within that group, we found just three instances of new laws that you could say made it easier to buy a weapon. (There are examples of states relaxing rules on carrying concealed weapons and the places where guns are allowed, but Shields specifically spoke about it being easier to buy guns.) Out of 16 states, only Michigan, Ohio and Florida relaxed some rules on gun purchasing. We'll explain the changes in each state. Changes in Michigan, Ohio and Florida Michigan emerged from 2010 with Republicans in charge of everything -- the governor’s office and both the House and the Senate. With large majorities in both chambers, they did away with the state system of requiring handgun buyers to get a purchase permit. Until then, a person who wanted to buy a handgun had to correctly answer at least seven out of 10 questions on gun safety. If they managed that, they got a card that they could take to a gun dealer and buy a weapon. Steven Howard is a lawyer and firearms expert based in Lansing, Mich. Howard said doing away with the purchase permit made little difference. ""The Brady background check remained in effect,"" Howard said. ""If you didn’t pass the Brady test, they didn’t sell you the gun."" But on a gun owner’s online discussion board, the end of the purchase permit was well received. A Michigan user called ""Mike the Greek"" was surprised to see notice of the relaxed rules in the window of his local gun store. ""Not sure if this is everywhere,  but it sure makes it easier for some people to buy!"" he wrote. Looking around at other states, according to records kept by the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, Ohio passed a law in 2011 that allowed people convicted of misdemeanor drug offenses to purchase firearms. In the midterm election, Republicans had taken the governor’s office and the Ohio House. In Florida, where the governor’s office also changed hands (from an independent to a Republican), counties were barred from imposing their own waiting periods on firearm purchases. (Most of the discussion in creating the Florida law was centered around where people could carry weapons, not about purchasing firearms.) Experts on both sides agree Laura Cutilletta is senior staff attorney at the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. Cutilletta said there was no significant easing of gun buying rules. ""There were certainly some laws that affect purchase, but they are not the majority by any means,"" Cutilletta said. Joseph Olson, a retired professor of law at Hamline University, and former board member of the National Rifle Association, also saw little change. ""A few states made it more difficult in some instances but almost all states did nothing regarding this issue,"" Olson said. Erich Pratt, director of communications for Gun Owners of America, told us the same thing. A couple of notes: • In 2012, Virginia repealed the restriction against the purchase of more than one handgun in a 30-day period. However, 2010 had no effect on the party balance of power in Virginia. • A review of state gun laws passed after the December 2012 shootings in Newtown, Conn., found that states with full Republican controll accounted for nearly three quarters of the changes that enhanced gun rights, mainly easing the rules for carrying weapons. But again, those change are distinct from the rules for buying a gun. Our ruling Shields said that when Republicans took control of state legislatures in 2010 they made it easier to buy a gun. Out of 16 states won by the GOP, three passed laws that relaxed the rules for some gun buyers. The experts we reached said the changes were modest and not as widespread as Shields implied",Mostly False,"October 16, 2014"
"Says Mark Warner ""has supported restrictions on veterans’ second amendment rights.""","Editor’s note: A version of this Truth-O-Meter that appeared in the Richmond Times-Dispatch on Sunday, Oct. 5, was posted with the wrong rating. The National Rifle Association says U.S. Sen. Mark Warner is soft on two issues dear to many Virginians -- guns and veterans. ""Mark Warner has supported restrictions on veterans’ second amendment rights,"" the NRA wrote in a flyer that hit mailboxes in September.   We wondered if the NRA is on target. The statement is based on the Senate’s consideration of the Safe Schools, Safe Communities Act of 2013, introduced in the wake of shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., that killed 20 children and six adults. The legislation, backed by President Barack Obama, sought to greatly expand background checks on potential gun buyers and put new limits on assault rifles and high capacity magazines. The bill failed to overcome a filibuster. The NRA’s claim zeroes in on an unsuccessful amendment that would have changed the method for putting veterans on a federal list of people banned from buying firearms because of mental health.  Warner and Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., voted against the measure. The amendment was fashioned after a bill introduced two years earlier by Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., and then-Sen. Jim Webb, D-Va., to end what they called ""the arbitrary process through which the government strips veterans and other Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) beneficiaries of their Second Amendment rights."" Federal law bans the purchase of firearms by people who have been ruled by a judge to be mentally defective or involuntarily committed to a mental institution or incompetent to handle his own affairs. Some states, including Virginia, share the rulings with the FBI and the individual’s name is listed in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS).    Veterans, however, are subject to additional scrutiny. They can be found mentally incompetent to own guns either by the courts or a VA examiner. Since the 1968 Gun Control Act, the VA has equated mental capacity to manage finances with mental stability to own and purchase firearms. The NICS was created in 1998. If a VA examiner determines a veteran cannot manage his finances – take the VA benefit check and make necessary payments – the VA appoints a fiduciary. It could be a spouse or family member. But once a veteran is so judged, the VA submits the veteran’s name to the FBI for inclusion on the national list of people banned from buying arms. Burr said veterans were being held to a different standard than others. His amendment would have stripped the VA of its role and put determination of a veteran’s mental stability solely in the hands of judges. During debate, Burr said 129,000 veterans have been deemed mentally incompetent by the VA. ""Let me suggest that the current process is arbitrary,"" he said. ""It doesn't look at whether they represent a danger to themselves or to others. It is in no way relevant to whether the individual should have access to firearms."" The same standard for other Americans should be applied to veterans, he said. ""Clearly, after an appropriate determination, if a veteran, or any other American, is found to be a harm to themselves or has a mental disability, we would all agree that person should be disqualified from gun ownership,"" Burr said. Burr’s measure was among six amendments offered to the gun control bill. Some, like Burr’s, were narrow in scope. Others sought to overhaul the entire bill. Warner’s campaign spokesman, David Turner, told us his boss voted against Burr’s measure because he favored an overhaul amendment offered by Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Pat Toomey, R-Pa.  The measure, which beefed up criminal backgrounds checks and offered grants to encourage states to participate in the national data base, was introduced as a compromise on gun control. The legislation Warner backed also sought a middle ground on veterans. It required the VA to send a letter to veterans deemed mentally incompetent explaining the impact the ruling has on their gun rights and their options for contesting it. The amendment would have set up an appeals process through courts or an independent board.   As things stand, veterans have no opportunity to appeal a decision requiring a fiduciary outside of the VA. Senators said during the 2013 debate that fewer than 200 veterans have had their incompetency rulings reversed by the VA. Our ruling The NRA says Warner ""has supported restrictions on veterans’ second amendment rights."" As proof, it cites the senator’s 2013 vote against an amendment that would have ended a VA policy of submitting the names of veterans it deems mentally unstable to the the FBI for inclusion on a national list of people barred from buying guns. People who didn’t serve in the military, by contrast, can only be declared mentally unfit to buy a gun by a judge. So there’s a basis for the NRA’s claim: Warner voted against abolishing a restriction on buying guns that only affects veterans. What the NRA ignores is that Warner voted for a different amendment that would have opened a appeals route for veterans outside of the VA -- to judges or an independent board.  While Warner did not back the change desired by the NRA, he did support a policy change. The NRA’s statement is accurate but needs additional information",Mostly True,"October 6, 2014"
"Republican House candidate Marilinda Garcia ""even opposes closing the loophole that allows dangerous criminals to get a gun without a background check.""","The liberal group Americans for Responsible Solutions asserts that New Hampshire Republican Marilinda Garcia holds views different from most of the state’s residents. In a 30-second spot titled ""Strange Ideas,"" Americans for Responsible Solutions -- founded by former U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, former astronaut Mark Kelly -- says Garcia opposes raising the minimum wage, giving women the same pay as men for the same jobs, and gun ownership restrictions. Giffords is a former Democratic U.S. Representative from a district in Arizona. She was seriously wounded in an assassination attempt in Tucson, Ariz., on Jan. 8, 2011, and has since become a leading advocate for preventing gun violence. ""Marilinda Garcia has some strange ideas,"" the ad says. ""Most people in New Hampshire want to raise the minimum wage. Garcia opposes it. Most people support guaranteeing women get equal pay for equal work. Garcia’s against that, too. Garcia even opposes closing the loophole that allows dangerous criminals to get a gun without a background check. Granite Staters deserve commonsense leadership, not Marilinda Garcia."" PolitiFact New Hampshire decided to check the record on those claims. In this article, we’ll take a look at whether Garcia ""opposes closing the loophole that allows dangerous criminals to get a gun without a background check."" About halfway through the ad, an image is shown of a smiling Garcia holding a pink rifle in front of racks of other guns. The printed message says, ""Garcia’s against closing gun loopholes."" Lower on the screen, what looks like a newspaper clipping has the headline: ""Online ads are the latest way gun buyers can avoid background checks."" Another common loophole for people to buy firearms without a background check is at gun shows. As evidence for its claim, the ad cites an article from The Hill, a Capitol Hill newspaper, titled, ""Influential Hispanic Republicans rally around underdog Garcia in NH"" published on June 9. When contacted, a spokesman for Americans for Responsible Solutions, pointed to the article in The Hill and said that ensuring background checks for all gun sales has widespread support.    The March interview cited by The Hill does not directly address gun show loopholes. Instead, Garcia is quoted as saying that lawmakers are ""too reactionary sometimes,"" and pointed to the push for new restrictions on gun rights in the New Hampshire House, according to the article. ""Clearly most of those were connected to mental-health issues, so why don’t we first identify what the real problem is before we end up sort of really infringing on the rights of law-abiding citizens, because that’s what seems to be happening?"" There’s some clearer evidence from Garcia’s tenure as a legislator. In February 2014, the New Hampshire House killed a bill, HB 1589, that would have required background checks for almost all gun sales. The intention of the law was to ""protect public safety by helping to keep guns out of the hands of felons, domestic abusers, the dangerously mentally ill,"" according to the text of the bill, which was introduced by eight Democrats. There was never a roll call vote on the measure, but when it came time to debate the issue in the House, Second Amendment advocate J.R. Hoell proposed changing the law to ""study the correlation between current New Hampshire law and the low violent crime rate in this state."" Such a change would have vastly changed its original aim of requiring background checks for virtually all gun sales. Garcia voted in favor of the amendment to change the measure, and it passed by two votes. Eventually the bill was scrapped by a vote of 242-118, with individual votes not recorded. More recently, in an email to PolitiFact, Cunningham didn’t offer a specific response to Garcia’s position on the issue but instead said, ""Decreasing gun violence and maintaining the safety of every American is a top priority, but Marilinda knows that achieving this task does not generally involve imposing federal regulations on the 2nd amendment."" So Garcia hasn’t really supported keeping the ""gun show loophole"" -- but nor has she clearly advocated getting rid of it. It’s also worth noting that the ad’s assertion that ""dangerous criminals"" get their guns through loopholes in the law is somewhat exaggerated. All kinds of people buy weapons at these shows, and that doesn’t make them ""dangerous criminals."" Indeed, experts says the most common ways criminals obtain guns is to get them through straw buyers, through less-than scrupulous online dealers, or by stealing them, according to a Frontline report, titled ""how criminals get guns."" Our ruling The ad claims that Garcia ""even opposes closing the loophole that allows dangerous criminals to get a gun without a background check."" Her comments on gun control, both past and present, are too vague to draw any real conclusion, but her vote to effectively water down a background-checks bill while serving in the state House does provide some support for the ad’s claim",Mostly True,"October 3, 2014"
"""Mary Landrieu voted to take away your gun rights.""","The National Rifle Association, the nation’s largest gun lobbying group, is targeting a handful of Democrats in close Senate races with one of the most provocative — if not downright scary —  ads of the campaign season. Let’s set the scene: A young mother puts to bed her infant child and receives a text, presumably from her husband, letting her know his plane landed. ""Love you. Good night,"" she texts back. Suddenly, an ominous shadow is outside a window and a figure busts into the front door. Cut to a scene with police tape outside the home, suggesting tragedy. ""It happens like that,"" a narrator says. ""The police can’t get there in time. How you defend yourself is up to you. It’s your choice. But Mary Landrieu voted to take away your gun rights."" Replace Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., with Sen. Mark Udall, D-Colo., and you get the ad running in Colorado. How do we get from a vote in Congress to an intruder barreling through a poor woman’s front door? It’s far from a straight line. The NRA’s first justification When the Washington Post Fact Checker looked at this question, NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam pegged Landrieu’s vote ""to take away your gun rights"" to her support of the Toomey-Manchin proposal (named after its sponsors, Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., and Joe Manchin, D-W.Va.). That proposal, which failed 54 to 46 in April 2013, did not ban the sale of any firearms. Its most significant provision would have expanded federal background checks already in place to firearm purchases made at gun shows and over the Internet. You could still buy a weapon from a family member or friend without a background check. The Fact Checker concluded that it’s hard to envision a situation in which Toomey-Manchin would have prevented a woman from being able to defend herself against an intruder. Assuming the woman in the ad was legally eligible to purchase a firearm (meaning she doesn’t have a criminal record), she would not have any trouble owning a gun in her home — even if Toomey-Manchin passed. The Fact Checker gave the claim Four Pinocchios, its harshest rating. The NRA’s second justification By the time PolitiFact inquired, the NRA offered different evidence as support for its claim. The group told PolitiFact that its claim stems from Landrieu’s vote to confirm Justice Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court in 2009, a pick the NRA opposed. ""Landrieu voted to confirm at least one anti-gun and anti-self defense (Supreme Court) justice,"" said NRA spokesman Arulanandam. ""Anti-self defense is life or death."" During Sotomayor’s nomination proceedings, her past ruling on a Second Amendment issue became a talking point for Republicans who were critical of President Barack Obama’s choice. While on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second District, Sotomayor was part of a three-member panel that reviewed a lower court ruling in Maloney vs. Cuomo. At issue was whether New York could ban the chuka stick (commonly called nunchucks, a weapon with two sticks connected by a chain or rope). Sotomayor was part of a majority opinion that ruled the New York statute legal. The Second Amendment applies to federal laws but not state laws, they wrote, citing an 1886 Supreme Court decision. During her confirmation testimony, Sotomayor reasoned that the Supreme Court had not yet ruled on whether its decision in Heller vs. District of Columbia — which overturned the federal capital’s handgun ban — applied to all cities and states. So, Sotomayor said, she was applying the precedent as it was understood at that point. Several Republican senators cited this case as reason to vote against Sotomayor’s nomination. (Worth noting, Landrieu actually supported the court’s decision in Heller to overturn the D.C. handgun ban and signed onto a letter from Sen. Kay Hutchison, R-Texas, to codify the Supreme Court’s ruling.) The Supreme Court eventually ruled, by a 5-4 margin in 2010, to strike down Chicago’s ban against owning a handgun in the home. This effectively applied the Heller ruling to all local governments. Sotomayor, by then on the Supreme Court, signed on to a minority opinion that argued the Second Amendment did not prohibit local governments from regulating firearms or banning certain weapons in the home. No other major gun issues have come before the Supreme Court during Sotomayor’s time. In fact, it has turned down requests to review the right to have a handgun outside the home, said Amy Howe, editor of the popular Supreme Court analysis website SCOTUSblog. Problems with the second justification So how convincing is the Sotomayor argument? It has some considerable holes. For starters, it’s a slippery slope to claim that a vote for a Supreme Court justice is a vote ""to take away your gun rights."" To use the same logic, was a vote to confirm President George W. Bush’s nomination of John Roberts also a vote for the Affordable Care Act just because he ruled to uphold the individual mandate? Was a vote for Justice Anthony Kennedy — the justice appointed by President Ronald Reagan who became the swing vote in the case that effectively ended California’s same-sex marriage ban — a vote to legalize same-sex marriage? In other words, no one can tell in advance how justices will eventually vote on issues that come before the court. Justices appointed by Republicans can surprise and take what would be considered the liberal position in a case, and vice versa. We will also note that Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., joined seven of their Republicans to confirm Sotomayor’s nomination. Yet the NRA gave them each an A- rating for their votes on gun issues and endorsed them for reelection this year. So this is either selective memory or the NRA applying its own logic differently to candidates. As for Landrieu, her campaign said she has supported pro-gun measures over the years, including a proposal that requires states to recognize concealed carry permits issued by other states. She also voted against an assault weapons ban supported by the White House in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. The NRA also opposed the measure. Our ruling The NRA ad claims, ""Mary Landrieu voted to take away your gun rights."" This is quite a leap in logic. After initially staking its claim to a background check bill that didn’t pass Congress — nor did it ""take away your gun rights,"" leaving women defenseless in their homes — the group now pins its claim on Landrieu’s vote to confirm Sotomayor to the Supreme Court. But that’s questionable, since there is no way to know in advance how a justice will vote. And the NRA has endorsed two other senators, Graham and Alexander, who cast exactly the same vote. Meanwhile, on the other major gun vote of this term, a key assault-weapons ban, Landrieu voted the NRA’s position. Given all this, to run an ad as scary as this one can only be described as fear mongering",False Pants on Fire,"October 1, 2014"
"The Justice Department’s Fast and Furious gun-walking program ""started in the Bush administration.""","Pundits are dissecting the complicated legacy of Attorney General Eric Holder, who intends to resign the position he’s had since 2009 when the Senate confirms his successor. Some have analyzed the move with less accuracy than others. Jane Harman, a former Democratic congresswoman from California and CEO of the Wilson Center, argued Holder accomplished many good things as the nation’s first black attorney general, but he could be faulted ""for being politically tone-deaf."" ""And some of the things he did I think backfired. Not dropping Fast and Furious, which started in the Bush administration, was a mistake,"" she said during a Sept. 28 Fox News Sunday panel. ""Not notifying people about the Khalid Sheikh Mohammed trial in New York before he announced it, was a mistake. And not -- and the timing of the indictments of the Chinese was a mistake. But on balance is, I think his tone and his professionalism and his focus on race were pluses."" Harman’s claim about the origin of the Justice Department’s controversial ""Fast and Furious"" program was flagged by one of our readers. It is inaccurate. President Barack Obama made the same error during the 2012 election season in describing the program’s launch. PolitiFact rated his claim that it started ""under the previous administration"" as False. The ""Fast and Furious"" operation started in October 2009, about 10 months into Obama’s first term. Under the program, federal agents based in Arizona allowed straw buyers to buy guns in the United States and cross into Mexico so the weapons could be traced to, in theory, high-level drug cartel members. The idea backfired when two guns that the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives had lost track of were found at the crime scene of U.S. Border Patrol agent Brian Terry, who was killed Dec. 14, 2010. Investigations launched by Congress and the Justice Department in the wake of Terry’s death found many flaws with the ""gun-walking"" program designed by ATF’s Phoenix Field Division to go after cartels. So Fast and Furious doesn’t date back to Bush. But the idea of gun-walking in general does trace back to the previous administration. The Justice Department’s inspector general noted that the gun-walking strategy originated in the ATF’s Phoenix office under a 2006 program named ""Operation Wide Receiver."" Operation Wide Receiver unfolded between March 2006 and December 2007 with ATF agents based in Tucson. The agents knew firearms were being purchased by straw buyers for illegal use in Mexico but did not go after the weapons. Ultimately, the inspector general’s report found that the agents did not make any arrests as a result of the program and seized fewer than 100 of about 400 firearms that were purchased. Harman said via a spokesman, ""The gun-walking program began in 2006 under the Bush Administration. It had a different name, but it was a similar program."" Our ruling Harman said Fast and Furious ""started in the Bush administration."" Like a similarly worded claim from Obama two years ago, her claim is inaccurate. There was a program run by ATF’s Phoenix Field Division called Operation Wide Receiver that started during the Bush administration, but Operation Fast and Furious was a specific effort launched after Obama took office in 2009",False,"September 30, 2014"
"""Obama admin gutted @ProjChildSafe budget to provide trigger locks and safety kits.""","For well over a decade, gun owner groups have promoted the use of trigger locks to protect children from weapons around the home. One long-standing effort is Project Child Safe, run by the National Shooting Sports Foundation, the voice of gun makers, shooting ranges, and retailers. Conservative radio host and commentator Dana Loesch went to Twitter to berate President Barack Obama for neglecting this approach. ""Obama admin gutted @ProjChildSafe budget to provide trigger locks and safety kits,"" Loesch tweeted Sept. 4, 2014. We wanted to see whether the current administration drove down spending for this particular trigger lock program. We emailed Loesch’s show for evidence to back up the statement, but we did not hear back. The senior vice president and general counsel for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, Lawrence Keane, explained that Project Child Safe is a nonprofit run by his group and is largely sustained by the foundation and private donations. But during the administration of President George W. Bush, it received a great deal of government support. ""There was grant funding from the Department of Justice,"" Keane said. ""There were a number of different grants. They varied in size. Over time, they totaled $90 million over 8 years."" The foundation used the money to buy trigger locks and safety manuals. It partnered with over 15,000 state and local law enforcement agencies across all 50 states to distribute these safety kits for free to gun owners. Keane said since 2001, the program has provided over 36 million kits, with no government money going toward salaries or overhead. There’s no question the federal money is a fraction of what it was. Whether that happened on Obama’s watch is another matter. A more complicated picture We went to USA Spending, a government website that gives anyone the chance to see how federal agencies spend the taxpayers’ money. 2002 was the high-water mark for federal grants to the National Shooting Sports Foundation. That year, the Justice Department awarded it nearly $50 million to cover the costs of trigger locks and other safety materials. 2003 was also a strong year. Washington provided another $25 million. But as this chart shows, after that, the flow of government dollars to the foundation plummeted.  In 2006, the Department of Justice gave the foundation $917,850. By 2008, the amount fell to $500,000. These declines took place under the Bush administration, three years before Obama took office. The chart also shows a shift in the federal agency that supported the distribution of safety kits. In 2009, the Department of Veterans Affairs began granting the National Shooting Sports Foundation to provide the kits to veterans. ""The VA approached the National Shooting Sports Foundation because of concerns they had, and have, with returning vets having post-traumatic stress disorder,"" Keane said. Under the Obama administration, the VA provided the foundation about $3 million through 2012 to deliver about 1.5 million Project Child Safe safety kits, according to Keane. On an annual basis, that is slightly more than the amount spent in the last year of the Bush administration. Keane said the work with the VA is ongoing with an estimated additional $2 million in the pipeline. According to the Justice Department, the foundation had provided 32 million kits by 2005. In the seven years since, about 4 million kits have been delivered. Our ruling Loesch said that the Obama administration gutted the budget for Project Child Safe. In reality, the deepest cuts took place during the Bush years. Obama inherited a program funded at $500,000. In 2009, the funding agency changed from the Justice Department to Veterans Affairs. While the funding for Project Child Safe itself ended, the same kind of kits were distributed to peoples’ homes, although through different channels. Funding increased very slightly from the last year of the Bush administration. The work between the foundation and Veterans Affairs continues",False,"September 8, 2014"
"In 2012, there were nearly 12.2 million arrests and only 410 ""uses of deadly force"" by police in the United States.","In the wake of the fatal police shooting in Ferguson, Mo., Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn was interviewed for nearly an hour on Wisconsin Public Radio about the incident and its implications. At one point during the Aug. 20, 2014 interview, Flynn told host Kathleen Dunn ""there are many reasons why (police) uses of force are dramatically down, and the main one is training."" Then, alluding back to Ferguson, the chief added: ""It's an extraordinarily rare event. But the fact is, (in) 2012, there were 12,197,000 arrests in the United States, OK? And there were 410 uses of deadly force. Now that is, I think, three-thousands of a percent. So, it’s still an extraordinarily rare event."" In the comparison Flynn uses, there is one police killing in 0.00003 percent of all arrests -- an even tinier fraction than he suggested. But expressed another way, the 410 is an average of more than one police killing per day. So, what about the two figures themselves: Are they accurate and do they account for all of the people who are killed by police? Renewed focus Around the country, attention to the use of deadly force by police was heightened after Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old, was shot to death on Aug. 9, 2014, in Ferguson, a St. Louis suburb. In Milwaukee, residents held rallies to raise questions about the Brown case and about the April 2014 death of Dontre Hamilton, a 31-year-old who was shot multiple times by a police officer during a struggle in Red Arrow Park in downtown Milwaukee. (In Milwaukee, there was one police killing of a citizen in 2012, four in 2013 and two through late August of 2014, the Police Department told us.) PolitiFact National rated Half True a claim by conservative talk show host Michael Medved that ""more whites than blacks are victims of deadly police shootings."" The claim ignored the fact that there are more than five times more whites than blacks in America. And our colleagues rated as False a statement that an unarmed black person is shot by a police officer every 28 hours. The report that had been cited by CNN pundit Marc Lamont Hill looked at all deaths, not just those of unarmed individuals. And it rolled in some deaths that did not involve police officers. Flynn’s claim Flynn, who headed the police departments in Arlington, Va., and Springfield, Mass., before becoming Milwaukee’s chief in 2008, is known nationally for his use of data. When we asked for evidence for Flynn’s claim, a Milwaukee police spokesman cited two FBI reports. Both are from 2012, the most recent full-year statistics available. There were 12,196,959 arrests across the country in 2012, which means the figure Flynn used -- 12,197,000 -- was rounded up only slightly. The highest numbers of those arrests were for drug abuse violations, driving under the influence and larceny-theft. There were also 410 cases of justifiable homicide in 2012, according to the FBI, which defines justifiable homicide as the killing of a felon by a law enforcement officer in the line of duty. For example: A police officer responding to a bank robbery alarm who shot a suspect after the suspect fired at the officer. But that doesn’t taken into account all police killings of citizens. FiveThirtyEight.com, a news website devoted to data analysis, recently reported that the 410 is a minimum figure. The numbers are self-reported by local police agencies and not audited, not all police agencies report those figures to the FBI and the number doesn’t include homicides that weren’t ruled justifiable. The FBI totals are likely an undercount for another reason, criminologists told us. Researchers who examine police killings of citizens within large metropolitan police departments often find that the number of such incidents recorded by the departments are higher than the number of justifiable homicides reported by the FBI. But the criminologists also noted Flynn’s comparison is one legitimate way to measure the frequency of police killings.   Our rating Flynn said that in 2012, there were nearly 12.2 million arrests and ""410 uses of deadly force"" by police in the United States. The Milwaukee police chief correctly quotes official FBI statistics on arrests and justifiable homicides by law enforcement officers, although it appears the 410 is an undercount of the number of people killed by police",Mostly True,"August 29, 2014"
"""There have been at least 100 shootings each year [Angel Taveras] has been mayor"" of Providence.","A political action committee backing Rhode Island Treasurer Gina Raimondo for governor is leveling a series of attacks against one of her opponents in the Sept. 9 Democratic primary, Angel Taveras, mayor of Providence. In a four-page pamphlet mailed to voters by the American LeadHERship PAC, one of the attacks focused on crime, noting that, under Taveras, there had been cuts to the police budget and the size of the force had fallen to its lowest number in years. Then came this claim:  ""There have been at least 100 shootings each year Taveras has been mayor."" (The claim was repeated in large print in a subsequent mailing.) PolitiFact Rhode Island last examined Providence's crime statistics in a July 24, 2014 item after Taveras said, ""If you look at what we’ve done over the last several years, the crime rate has actually gone down in [Providence] and . . . the number of shootings has been going down.""  We ruled the mayor’s claim Half True because the trends weren't that clear-cut. For example, the crime rate actually ticked up during his first year in office, only to subsequently come down. For this fact check we will review the statistics on the number of people shot in the city. (Police do not tally the number of reports of shots being fired, a statistic the city doesn't keep because it can be impossible to tell the difference between a gun going off and fireworks, for example.   The LeadHERship pamphlet cites a July 26, 2014, story in The Providence Journal that refers to ""a constant drumbeat of violence in the capital city over the past three years with more than 100 shootings annually."" That covers 2011-2013. And what about 2014? When we emailed American LeadHERship PAC founder Kate Coyne-McCoy to find out if the total had reach 100 for 2014, she referred us to our July 24 PolitiFact item, which reported 61 shootings through July 12, 2014. The total was 69 as of this writing, so it could hit 100 by year's end, but it's not even close to that yet. So the number of shootings has not hit 100 for ""each year"" of the Taveras administration. The LeadHERship statement also ignores some significant context: The number of shootings, which peaked at 108 in 2011, declined in the subsequent two years of Taveras' tenure, dropping to 105 in 2012 and 100 in 2013. Before Taveras took office, the numbers were lower but steadily increasing. The annual total was 47 shootings in 2006 (during the tenure of his predecessor, David Cicilline), 58 in 2007, 77 in 2008, 86 in 2009, and 90 in 2010, Cicilline's final year, before jumping sharply to 108 during Taveras' first year",Mostly True,"August 29, 2014"
"""I was able to go and buy an automatic weapon … Most people can go out and buy an automatic weapon.""","Fans of the Second Amendment have been chiding CNN’s Don Lemon for his comments about the sorts of guns you can legally buy in this country. They’ve said Lemon was confused, and his exchange with conservative radio host Ben Ferguson on Aug. 20, 2014, was embarrassing. It began when Lemon, broadcasting live from Ferguson, Mo., said he supported the Second Amendment but that he doubted the Founding Fathers were thinking about automatic weapons when they wrote it. Ferguson shot back. ""Let’s deal with the facts here,"" Ferguson said. ""A semi-automatic weapon is a gun that you or I is allowed to own and in different places they have different rules. But to imply that anyone can just go out and buy an automatic weapon is just not true, Don."" ""What do you mean?"" Lemon said. ""During the theater shooting in Colorado, I was able to go and buy an automatic weapon, and I maybe have shot a gun three, four times in my life. I don’t live in Colorado. I think most people can go out and buy an automatic weapon."" This fact-check zeros in on Lemon’s claim that ""most people can go out and buy an automatic weapon."" The gun Lemon bought in Colorado was an AR-15. The version sold by the Bushmaster company is described as a semi-automatic. When Ferguson pointed out the difference between a fully automatic and an semi-automatic weapon, Lemon dismissed the distinction as a matter of semantics. ""An automatic weapon is something that you can shoot off a number of rounds very quickly,"" Lemon said. That is not the legal definition of an automatic weapon, but this debate pulls back the curtain on a couple of wrinkles in what federal law says and does not say. For starters, the law fails to define the term ""automatic."" Semi vs. fully automatic The 1968 Gun Control Act defines a semi-automatic as ""any repeating rifle which utilizes a portion of the energy of a firing cartridge to extract the fired cartridge case and chamber the next round, and which requires a separate pull of the trigger to fire each cartridge."" The key part there is the ""separate pull of the trigger."" One pull = one shot. The law speaks clearly about what it means by the term semi-automatic. When it comes to the term ""automatic,"" a little inference is required. The 1934 National Firearms Act defines a machine gun as ""any weapon which shoots, is designed to shoot, or can be readily restored to shoot, automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger."" Note that part about more than one shot by ""a single function of the trigger."" One pull = many shots. That’s the legal difference between a semi-automatic and a fully automatic weapon. The AR-15 that Lemon bought was a semi-automatic. People can go out and buy such guns at many stores across the country. Buying a fully automatic gun is a very different and more restricted process, which we’ll get into in just a bit. But it’s interesting that while the legal definition of a machine gun talks about firing automatically, there is no definition of an automatic weapon as such. We asked the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms and a couple of top legal experts on federal gun laws. No one could point to legal language, court ruling or federal rule that make a machine gun interchangeable with an automatic, even though in a practical sense, they are. Yes, you can buy a machine gun During the exchange between Lemon and Ferguson, Ferguson said ""the majority of private citizens are not allowed to own full automatic weapons."" Steven Howard is a lawyer and firearms expert based in Lansing, Mich. Howard said the ban on machine guns is not quite as complete as Ferguson’s words might sound. ""Most people can buy machine guns in lots of states,"" Howard said. ""But, and this is one of those classic big ‘buts,’ they have to get through a background check by FBI that is as thorough as if you are getting clearance to become a federal agent."" Howard said those checks can take up to six months. States such as California, Iowa and Kansas, ban private ownership under any circumstances. But in about half the country, including Florida and Texas, if you pay the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms $200 and have a clean record free of any history of domestic violence or a felony conviction, you can get yourself a machine gun legally. However, Joseph Olson, recently retired as professor of law at Hamline University, and a former board member of the National Rifle Association, said it won’t be a new one. ""There was a freeze put on them in 1986,"" Olson said. ""New Jersey representative (William) Hughes had an amendment that limited them to the ones that were registered at that time. There are a bit under 300,000 in circulation."" New devices blur the lines Since the key legal difference between a semi-automatic and a machine gun is whether pulling the trigger releases one bullet or many, it is worth noting that government regulators have approved devices that, when added to a rifle, allow a gun like an AR-15 to fire many rounds at great speed. They are called bump stocks, or trigger activators. The hunting supplier Cabela’s offers one called the Slide Fire. ""Maximize your fun with this safe and innovative AR-15 stock, which uses bump-fire technology to shoot as quickly as desired,"" the retailer says on its website. Videos show shooters going through clip after clip of ammunition. Howard said that while the rate of fire mimics a machine gun, the mechanism is different. ""If you very slowly pull the trigger, the recoil causes the gun to jump back and forth,"" Howard said. ""And that causes the trigger to be pulled."" By government standards, this retains the role of human intervention for each shot fired. Howard said the impact of trigger activators is less than meets the eye. He said they easily fail and make a gun difficult to aim. ""People don’t use them in crimes because you have to use them so carefully,"" Howard said. Still, there are enthusiastic reviews on the Cabela's website. A buyer who calls himself ""Freddie Joe"" wrote, ""This is an extremely fun addition to your A/R. The only problem will be the amount of shells you will go through. I went through 300 in a couple of days ... When you get really good at using this product, you can empty a 30-round clip in a matter of seconds. Cool!"" Our ruling CNN’s Lemon said that many people can go out and buy an automatic weapon. Lemon spoke as though the gun he had purchased was an automatic. It was not. It was a semi-automatic, meaning each shot requires a separate pull of the trigger. The ease of purchase that Lemon described applies to semi-automatic guns. The legal status and availability of semi-automatic and fully automatic guns are quite different. Lemon was further incorrect when he didn’t revise his language and insisted that the distinction was just a matter of semantics. Acquiring a machine gun is prohibited in some states, while much more heavily regulated in others",False,"August 26, 2014"
The Milwaukee Police Department has seized nearly as many firearms this year as the much larger New York City Police Department.,"In the wake of a shooting that wounded two children, ages 10 and 11, Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn held a news conference and denounced the shooters as cowards. ""We have remorseless, reckless criminals in possession of high-quality firearms shooting at each other, and they don't care who they hit,"" Flynn said of the July 23, 2014 shooting in the 2800 block of N. 37th St. As of that date, there had been 13 kids wounded in such shootings in 2014. One of those, Sierra Guyton, who was wounded in a playground shooting, later died. Flynn said getting firearms off the streets is a focus of his department’s efforts and then offered a statement that you don’t hear often when it comes to crime -- how efforts in Milwaukee compare favorably to New York City. ""As of July 6th, the New York City Police Department had confiscated approximately 1,350 firearms from the streets of a city of 9 million,"" the chief said. ""So far this year, the Milwaukee Police Department in a city of 600,000 -- 15 times smaller than New York -- has seized 1,340 firearms from the streets of this city."" Are Milwaukee cops keeping pace with the NYPD when it comes to gun seizures? Let’s take a closer look. A visit from NYC brass When Flynn made the claim, New York’s numbers were top-of-mind. ""Several NYPD executive level commanders were sent to Milwaukee by Commissioner (William) Bratton to study a variety of topics, including our methods of crime control, community relations, and accountability systems,"" said Lt. Mark Stanmeyer, Milwaukee Police Department spokesman. Indeed, the visit coincided with the day of the shooting and Flynn’s next-day news conference. When the topic of gun seizures was discussed at the get-together, New York officials said they had seized 1,350 firearms as of July 6, 2014, according to Stanmeyer. MPD officials saw that figure nearly matched theirs -- 1,347 seizures as of July 24, 2014. To be sure, the MIlwaukee figure included an extra two-plus weeks. But Flynn had a talking point. When we asked New York Police Department officials about guns seized, they were not able to provide the number for July 6, 2014 that was used by Flynn. But their data tracked with the figure Flynn used  -- 1,289 firearms had been seized as of June 8, 2014 and 1,881 had been seized as of Aug. 10, 2014, according to department spokeswoman Sophia Mason. To get the comparison on the same time frame, the Milwaukee figure was 1,460 as of Aug. 10, 2014. In 2013, the department seized 1,921 guns. ""I don’t believe the point the Chief was making about the population/gun recovery ratio is lost,"" Stanmeyer said in an email. ""Even using the August 10 data, they only have 421 more guns with 7.7 million more people."" He also noted that the Milwaukee figure does not include 353 firearms turned in during a  gun buyback program last spring that was led by faith leaders. So what’s the explanation for the similar numbers? First, in New York the number of guns seized is down compared with last year. Bratton said in a June 10, 2014 report on Capitalnewyork.com that the number ""in some respects is reflective of the fact that crime is continuing to go down."" The numbers of murders, rapes and robberies also are lower than a year ago. ""We’ve had an increase, a temporary increase, in shootings. ... Crime goes up, it goes down,"" Bratton said in the article. ""It’s always going to go up at some point in time. We’ll always have the ability to push it down."" Another factor could be at work in New York. New Mayor Bill de Blasio promised to reform the department’s long-standing and controversial stop-and-frisk policy where cops can detain, question and search people suspected of crimes. Even before de Blasio took office in January 2014, the number of stop and frisk stops had dropped sharply in the past two years. Law enforcement officials told the New York Post that such stops can be effective in obtaining illegal firearms. Our rating Flynn said his department’s gun seizures, through a mid-year point, were about to those of  much-larger New York City. New York’s numbers may be down a bit this year, so other factors may be at work. But Flynn’s claim didn’t get into the reasons why. It was a straightforward numerical claim",True,"August 17, 2014"
"""Far more children died last year drowning in their bathtubs than were killed accidentally by guns.""","Gun safety advocates are pushing laws to make it harder for children to play with guns kept at home. A bill in the New York Legislature, for instance, would require gun owners to secure their weapons by either keeping them locked up or installing a trigger lock. Failing to do so could warrant fines, loss of a firearms license or potentially jail. Behind the New York proposal lies the tragic story of a 12-year-old boy who was accidentally killed by his friend when he went over to the friend’s house. Fox News discussed the New York story on Fox and Friends Weekend on Aug. 9, 2014. Tucker Carlson, show co-host and editor of the Daily Caller, a conservative news website, challenged the basic premise behind the bill. While the death of a child is ""the worst tragedy imaginable,"" Carlson said there’s a deeper truth. ""Far more children died last year drowning in their bathtubs than were killed accidentally by guns,"" Carlson said. ""I’d like to see a package on ‘Do you have a bathtub at home because I want to know before I let my child go over to your house.’ A little perspective might be helpful."" We reached out to Carlson to learn the source of his claim about deaths in bathtubs and deaths from guns. We didn’t hear back. We went to the federal government’s Center for Health Statistics to get some of that perspective that Carlson recommended. The data we found undercuts Carlson’s assertion. As the following table shows, total deaths for children 17 and under due to drowning in a bathtub were 95 in 2011, the latest year the numbers are available. Total deaths from accidental gun shots were 102. The one age range where Carlson might be able to make a case is for children 0 to 4 years old. For that group, 73 died in a bathtub and 29 were killed by guns. But in every other age group, guns are more deadly than bathtubs. Age Drowned in a bathtub Accidental gunfire 15-17 years 7 28 10-14 years 12 29 5-9 years 3 16 0-4 years 71 29 Total 93 102   Carlson didn’t say what age children he had in mind, but in the context of the story he was responding to — and his rhetorical question about something ""I want to know before I let my child go over to your house"" — this is not about children under 4 years old. Parents don't let toddlers ""go over"" to a friend’s house. For that age range, Carlson’s comparison is off by a factor of three. Bathtubs caused 22 deaths for kids 5 and older and guns caused 73 deaths. The Consumer Product Safety Commission issued a 2012 report on bathtub drownings. From 2006 to 2010, total deaths were 434 for an average of 87 per year. The bulk of those deaths, 348, involved children under 4 years old. Most of the time, 62 percent, the immediate cause was a parent or other caretaker leaving the room. Our ruling Carlson said far more children died last year drowning in their bathtubs than were killed accidentally by guns. First, there is no data for last year. The most recent data is from 2011. What that shows is that children 17 and under are more likely to die from accidental gunfire than from drowning in a bathtub, although the difference is small. However, for children 5 years old and up, government data show that guns are three times more deadly than bathtubs. Carlson was not just wrong, but with his phrase, ""far more children died,"" he was emphatically wrong",False Pants on Fire,"August 15, 2014"
"""If 20 million illegals vote, you can kiss the Second Amendment goodbye.""","Joe Miller thinks there’s an obvious link between illegal immigrants and the Second Amendment. In a recent mailer to Alaskans, the Republican candidate for U.S. Senate touts a record that is ""100 percent pro-gun"" and ""100 percent against amnesty."" And, he says he’s the only candidate with endorsements from various pro-gun groups. Alaska’s Republican primary is next Tuesday, and Miller is trailing far behind his opponents Mead Treadwell and Dan Sullivan (the leader) in the latest polls. Whoever wins will face off against incumbent Democrat Mark Begich. He says Begich wants to give amnesty and the right to vote to illegal immigrants currently living in the United States, and this is bad for the country’s gun rights. (Both Begich and Alaska’s other senator, Lisa Murkowski, voted for the Senate’s immigration reform bill.) ""If 20 million illegals vote, you can kiss the Second Amendment goodbye,"" the mailer says. We thought drawing a connection between illegal immigration and the right to bear arms was dubious, so we decided to dig into it. Understanding the amendment First, some background on the Second Amendment and how it’s interpreted: The amendment reads: ""A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."" So the Second Amendment ensures that Americans are born with a certain amount of gun freedom. How courts have interpreted the text, though, is important. In 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court decided in District of Columbia vs. Heller that an individual who is not part of a militia has the right to own a weapon. Additionally, the court said the amendment permits individuals to use the guns for legal purposes, like self defense in their homes. Two years later, the court ruled that these rights also apply to the states. But the Heller decision does not necessarily mean a person can own a gun of any type for any purpose. The court has approved gun regulations, such as the decision this year that upheld a ban on ""straw purchases"" (one person buying a gun for someone else). In sum, the court believes the Second Amendment means individuals have the right to own guns, with limited regulations. If 20 million people who all leaned one way or another on gun control were suddenly injected into the population, the surge could change the country’s political make-up and tip the balance in favor of Americans that support stricter gun laws, said Eugene Volokh, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. Under this scenario, he said, the country would elect politicians that support stricter gun laws, and those politicians would nominate Supreme Court judges who reflect their own views. These judges could reinterpret the Second Amendment as restricting gun ownership, and the right to bear arms as we currently understand it would disappear over time. This is also how the Miller campaign explained to us how immigration and gun rights are connected. However, the mailer does not say that the current understanding of the Second Amendment would disappear, it says the amendment would disappear altogether. Could that happen? ‘If pigs could fly’ Every scholar we spoke with agreed that it’s ridiculous to think that the Second Amendment could be removed from the Constitution under any circumstances -- let alone because of immigrants. ""If pigs could fly, would it change air travel?"" said Adam Winkler, also a UCLA law professor. ""I guess it might, but it’s hard to imagine the premise."" First of all, citizens (and undocumented immigrants) cannot vote on a change to the Constitution. Amending the Constitution is a laborious process that requires two-thirds of Congress and three-fourths of states to approve the change. With the current population, this would be nearly impossible, considering that only 25 percent of the country believes that there should be a law banning gun ownership except for police and other authorized individuals, according to a Gallup poll from October 2013. And just around 50 percent of the country thinks there shouldn’t be control over gun ownership, according to a February Pew study. The addition of 20 million new voters -- a population of about 6 percent -- of any ideological persuasion is unlikely to make a dent, said Clark Neily, senior attorney at the Institute for Justice. Additionally, there are about 12 million -- not 20 million -- illegal immigrants currently living in the United States, according to the latest estimates by Pew. (Alaska alone had fewer than 50 illegal immigrant households in 2010.) Of these illegal immigrants, about 60 percent of them are concentrated in just six states -- far fewer than the 38 states that would be needed to approve a change to the Constitution. It’s fair, though, for Miller to imply that illegal immigrants might be more sympathetic to Democrats than Republicans, Neily said. They are a predominantly Hispanic group, and Hispanics tend to align with Democrats. (In fact, a 2013 Pew study found that illegal immigrants strongly lean toward the Democratic Party.) America’s Hispanic community tends to be in favor of more gun restrictions. A recent Pew poll on political polarization found that 70 percent support controlling gun ownership, but that still leaves about 30 percent that prefer less control over gun ownership. If the primarily Hispanic illegal immigrants reflect this group, far fewer than 20 million would support scrapping the Second Amendment. At Republican primary debates recently, Miller explained why he thinks illegal immigrants would be more likely to support gun restrictions. ""There’s a clear correlation, and the clear correlation is this: If you end up granting amnesty to those who don’t value gun rights, who have not been raised in an environment where the Second Amendment is cherished -- is considered to be a God-given right -- the reality is over a generation or two, the likelihood is very strong that the Second Amendment will not be here,"" he said, according to Alaska Dispatch News. Even though it’s plausible immigrants could bring their cultural beliefs to the United States, it’s also likely that American culture -- which is overwhelmingly in favor of the Second Amendment -- would rub off on them, said Trevor Burrus, a research fellow at the Center for Constitutional Studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. Our ruling Miller said, ""If 20 million illegals vote, you can kiss the Second Amendment goodbye."" We found that it would be nearly impossible to remove the Second Amendment from the Constitution, given the country’s ideological make-up, and adding a voting bloc of 20 million would be unlikely to change that -- regardless of their political persuasions. However, it’s possible that adding 20 million new voters who lean Democrat could result in stricter gun control laws. Miller’s mailer muddies the waters, because increasing gun ownership regulations is not the same thing as scrapping the Second Amendment entirely. The ad is wrong when it suggests 20 million voters can repeal part of the Constitution’s Bill of Rights",False,"August 14, 2014"
"Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. advised citizens to ""point that barrel center mass and pull the trigger"" because ""911 is not our best option.""","A new TV ad by a liberal group uses Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr.’s own words to suggest he’s encouraging gun violence by discouraging use of the 911 emergency response system. ""I don’t dial 911,"" Clarke says in a clip featured in the ad. ""I will afterwards, to say ‘Come get this dead guy out of my house, he’s bleeding out and he’s messing up my carpet.’"" The ad ends with another excerpt from that interview: ""Point that barrel (at) center mass and pull the trigger."" At the top of the spot, a narrator says: ""Emergency responders. They risk their lives every day to help save ours. But Sheriff David Clarke says 911 is not our best option."" Does the new ad, paid for by the union-backed Greater Wisconsin Committee, accurately reflect Clarke’s views? Specifically, has Clarke advised citizens to ""point that barrel center mass and pull the trigger"" because ""911 is not our best option?"" A familiar controversy Clarke faces Milwaukee Police lieutenant Chris Moews in the Democratic primary for sheriff on Aug. 12, 2014. The new ad resurrects a controversy that began in January 2013 when Clarke’s office paid for a radio announcement in which he said: ""With officers laid off and furloughed, simply calling 911 and waiting is no longer your best option. You can beg for mercy from a violent criminal, hide under the bed, or you can fight back. But are you prepared?"" That prompted a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel story with this online headline: ""Sheriff David Clarke’s radio ad says 911 not best option, urges residents to take firearms classes."" After Clarke’s radio spot, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett criticized him, saying if there’s an emergency, ""I want people to call 911"" but Sheriff Clarke is ""discouraging people from calling 911, it’s just wrong."" About six weeks later, Clarke sat for a long interview with Project Veritas, a conservative group. that posted it online. The snippets of Clarke speaking in the Greater Wisconsin ad are from this interview. In that interview, Clarke said that Barrett had ""contorted"" the message in his radio spot by suggesting that he was advising that nobody call 911. The sheriff explained that it’s up to individual citizens to decide for themselves what they will do when confronted with possible harm. At the same time, Clarke made it clear not only what he personally would do, but what he would advise as the best course of action for citizens. He spoke in the context of potentially immediate danger, an example being an intruder breaking into your home. Twice he said the ""advice"" he would give people was based on what he himself would do: ""Use cover, because you don’t know if that clown trying to break into your house is armed. Know who and what your target is. Point that barrel center mass and pull the trigger."" He does not mention calling 911 in that sequence. Then he concludes: ""You see, the thing is 911 in that situation is not going to help you and that’s why I said it’s not your best option."" So the ad, notably, gets the ""not your best option"" context right. The other Clarke quote in the Greater Wisconsin Committee ad is from a section of the Project Veritas interview in which Clarke talks more about what he personally would do in that situation. Clarke tells the interviewer that a sign hangs on his own home picturing the head of a Rottweiler and a semiautomatic handgun with the message: ""We don’t dial 911."" ""I don’t call 911,"" Clarke explained. ""I will afterwards, to say ‘Come get this dead guy out of my house, he’s bleeding out and he’s messing up my carpet. And that’s not to sound, you know … that’s just the reality. I’m not going to fool around with that. But that’s the mindset I have but I’ve been a cop for 35 years, so I live with that every day and it becomes second nature..."" The sheriff, at that point in the interview, shifts back to what he’d like law abiding residents to consider doing. Government shouldn’t tell them what to do, he said. ""I trust them to make those decisions as to what to do,"" Clarke said. ""If they want to blow a whistle, fine, I don’t tell them not to."" But he made clear that he feels the best option is not waiting around for the police, or hiding under the bed, or running away. ""I don’t think that’s going to be very effective in some of these situations,"" Clarke said. ""So I want people to think about what’s going to be effective. If you want to run out of your house, fine, I’m not running out of my house unless it’s on fire. That’s my house, and I’m not running from it to give the bad guy carte blanche."" Ad vs. reality So how does the Greater Wisconsin ad compare to Clarke’s statements? The ad, despite the length limitations, gets Clarke’s message right and places it in the context -- using Clarke’s own words -- of a home invasion situation. Neither Clarke nor the ad is saying the sheriff suggests that calling 911 is never a good idea. (Clarke, in the interview, at one point seems to suggest he wants average citizens to call 911 if they can -- but then take matters into their own hands rather than wait for police to arrive). The other Clarke quote in the ad -- ""point the barrel center mass and pull the trigger"" -- is in fact Clarke’s advice to citizens. He says a 911 call isn’t  always possible and by itself isn’t effective because of long wait times for police. When we asked Clarke to respond to the ad, he said he stands behind what he said to Project Veritas and did not intend to watch the Greater Wisconsin ad. Clarke said he suspected the ad twisted his remarks, but he couldn’t recall the specific context of his comments in the interview cited in the ad, and he offered no specific criticisms. ""My position is clear,"" Clarke said. Our rating A Greater Wisconsin Committee ad said Sheriff David Clarke advised citizens to ""point that barrel center mass and pull the trigger"" because ""911 is not our best option."" Clarke did just that in an interview, and made similar comments in an earlier radio spot and in comments to PolitiFact Wisconsin",True,"August 7, 2014"
"Since 1999, 440 people have been killed in attacks on church property in the United States.","It’s been a month since House Bill 60 became law and cleared the way for Georgians to carry concealed weapons in several new venues – all bars, many government buildings and, generating the most news coverage, churches that allow it. Jerry Henry, executive director of GeorgiaCarry.org --- a pro-gun group that advocates for fewer gun restrictions --- repeated a strikingly high and somewhat specific number in defending allowing guns in sanctuaries. More than 440 people have been killed in attacks on church property since 1999, he told Georgia Public Broadcasting this spring. A reader questioned that figure shortly after the bill became law on July 1. We decided it was a worthy target for the AJC Truth-O-Meter. Already, PolitiFact found flaws in a specific count from the other side of the gun debate. Everytown for Gun Safety claimed there were 74 school shootings in the United States since Sandy Hook, a tally that included incidents such as a teacher who committed suicide in a school parking lot overnight. We rated that claim Mostly False. Henry told PolitiFact Georgia that he relied on two specific websites, Cops and Cross and Carl Chinn's church security site, for the statistic. He used the term church generically, to cover all houses of worship. Cops and Cross is run by Jimmy Meeks, a former police officer who teaches church safety across the country. A recent banner on the site listed more than 470 ""violent deaths on church and faith-based property since 1999,"" but does not include sources for those figures. Instead, it directs users to the site run by Carl Chinn, a former building engineer for Focus on the Family. Chinn was among responders when a gunman took four people hostage at the conservative Christian group’s headquarters, and later surrendered, in 1996. Chinn said in an email that he relies on news reports, official records and blog items for his figures. Many incidents have multiple sources. That count, though, includes broad incidents not likely to be considered attacks. For instance, the first page of incidents for 2014 show at least two suicides on church property that, according to news reports, are not connected to the house of worship. GeorgiaCarry.org’s claim could also not be backed up with unimpeachable data elsewhere. The Centers for Disease Control found that the majority of the 166 deaths that occurred at houses of worship between 2003 and 2011 were suicides. But the National Violent Death Reporting System covers only 17 states, including Georgia. The CDC cannot provide specific numbers on suicides from the total figure, a spokeswoman said, because that sample is too small. That means the figures are not nationally representative and cannot be used to create an estimate to verify or refute Chinn’s numbers. There is similar incomplete coverage from the National Incident-Based Reporting System, with only about 38 percent of Uniform Crime Reporting agencies providing information, according to the FBI. Without more data, the FBI cannot verify the statistic. The federal government has generally stopped funding such research over political battles between gun control advocates and gun rights advocates. Several prominent social scientists have asked that barriers to firearms research be lifted, and President Obama has signed an executive order for the CDC to research causes and prevention of gun violence. Without reliable statistics, Chinn’s data could be the best approximation of data available. And although advocates often speak with more certainty than data supports, David Kopel, the research director at the Libertarian-leaning Independence Institute, said there is value in stories behind some of the numbers. Anecdotally, backers of Georgia’s law need only to point to Matthew Murray, who killed two missionaries in a Colorado church’s mission training center in 2007, Kopel said. Murray continued his spree by killing two more people at the New Life Church in Colorado Springs. A congregant volunteering to help with security shot Murray, who then took his own life. There have been incidents closer to home. In July 2012, two people were killed in a shootout with each other outside a funeral at Victory for the World Church near Stone Mountain. In October of that year, Floyd Palmer gunned down Greg McDowell as he led a prayer at World Changers Church International in College Park. Palmer also was charged in 2001 with shooting a man outside a Maryland mosque. ""Are there incidents where someone comes into church with a gun, with the intent to commit suicide? I’m sure,"" said Clayton Cramer, an adjunct history professor at the College of Western Idaho who specializes in firearm history. ""How often? We don’t know."" ""Until such time that we have some real, hard data,"" Cramer added, ""the best thing to say is, there are examples where a churchgoer having a gun during a confrontation mattered or would have mattered,"" And that is where the claim of specific counts falls short. The data has some value in capturing the number of attacks on or at religious institutions. But there is no way to remove suicides from the death counts to ensure a more strict definition of attacks as understood by the general public. Without that ability, even a claim with some truth gives the wrong impression",Mostly False,"August 1, 2014"
"There are ""approximately 20,000 annual gun purchases in Rhode Island.""","As the gun debate continues to roil the nation and Rhode Island, Providence mayoral candidate Brett Smiley wants to take guns out of the hands of criminals. But how? Smiley, one of five Democrats vying for the seat, proposes  a supplemental 10-percent statewide sales tax ""on the approximately 20,000 annual gun purchases in Rhode Island and on ammunition purchases."" That in turn, would produce revenue to support community anti-violence efforts and other initiatives to part criminals from their guns. Smiley unveiled his ""Safest City Plan"" at a December press conference.  A seven-page campaign brochure he mailed to voters in the last week of June includes a version of that plan that reiterates his gun tax proposal. [A bill sponsored on Smiley’s behalf to impose the 10-percent statewide surplus gun tax failed to make it out of committee in the last General Assembly session]. So are there 20,000 guns sold a year in Rhode Island? First, let’s look at the laws for buying a gun in the state: Statutes 11-47-35 and 11-47-35.2. Anyone wanting to do so must first fill out a state purchase application form with a Federal Firearms Licensee - i.e., a licensed gun shop. The application is run through the FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) data base. The licensed firearms dealer sends a copy of the application to local or state police, and the attorney general’s department. They must later destroy the copies if no disqualifying information is found. If approved, you must wait seven days before you buy your firearm - or firearms (more than one gun can be purchased per application.) Smiley bases his claim on NICS Firearm Background Checks data.     Here are the NICS statistics from 2010-2014: 2010: 14,835 2011: 17,271 2012: 24,050 2013: 26,666 2014: 10,140 as of June 30 ""Looking just at the data for NICS Firearm Background Checks, you see that the Rhode Island figure has been steadily increasing in recent years, with 24,050 in 2012 and 26,666 in 2013,"" campaign manager Josh Block wrote in an email. ""It's also worth noting that these figures are for the number of people receiving background checks, and multiple guns purchased at the same time would still yield only one background check. Given these figures, it's clear that saying ""approximately 20,000 annual gun purchases in Rhode Island"" is an accurate, and frankly even a relatively conservative, estimate,"" Block wrote. He said that number refers specifically to the number of guns sold. Federal law prohibits the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives from creating a federal registry of gun transactions. The FBI must destroy all approved gun purchase records within 24 hours.   ""ATF does not gather or collect information pertaining to the number of guns sold,"" says Debora A. Seifert, public information officer for the ATF Boston field division. The FBI notes that the NICS Firearm Background Checks ""do not represent the number of firearms sold. Based on varying state laws and purchase scenarios, a one-to-one correlation cannot be made between a firearm background check and a firearm sale."" OK. But do those NICS statistics represent an approximate measure, as Smiley claims? Short of tallying every licensed firearms dealer’s register in the state, no one can say precisely how many guns are sold every year in Rhode Island. We turned to the Rhode Island State Police and attorney general’s office for some answers. We also called more than half a dozen local gun shop owners. In different ways, they suggested that, if anything Smiley’s estimated number is on the low side. Amy Kempe, spokeswoman for Atty. Gen. Peter F. Kilmartin, gave us a breakdown for the years 2010 through 2013, of the number of applications approved and denied. The data reflect a consistent ratio between approvals and denials: on average, fewer than 1 percent are denied. State police Major James M. Manni interprets the NICS data the same way as Smiley. ""Based on the number of NICS checks done - that’s factual that there are approximately 20,000 firearms sold in Rhode Island or even more"" every year, said Manni, state police commander of inspectional services. Take the 2013 figure of 26,666 firearms background checks for example, Manni says. ""Does that mean there were 26,000 guns sold? There could be more. You can buy multiple firearms"" on one application, however he notes that ""the vast majority are single sales."" Manni also noted that the numbers of applicants who are either denied a purchase -- or who ultimately decide not to buy a firearm -- are very small. He said that In 2014, ""in a six-month period, there were 10,140 NICS firearms background checks. So 2014 is on track for about 20,000"" of those checks.   Gun shop owners we spoke with also confirmed that very few applicants change their minds about buying a gun during the 7-day waiting period. And they confirmed that it’s impossible to determine precisely how many guns are purchased in the state each year. John Francis, owner of Competition Shooting Supplies, in Pawtucket, said  "" Unless you went to each dealer, and had each dealer count through our records … there’s no way to know."" Our ruling Brett Smiley says there are ""approximately 20,000 annual gun purchases in Rhode Island.""   There is no official registry of yearly gun sales in Rhode Island; state law prohibits it. But state and federal law enforcement officials cite the same statistics that Smiley does to back up his claim. Gun shop owners, and state police tell us that the majority of applications represent single sales",True,"July 20, 2014"
"Says attorney general candidate Jon Richards ""went so far to say he would only enforce the laws with which he personally agreed.""","""Lawlessness"" was the subject of a June 26, 2014 fund-raising email that Brad Schimel, the lone Republican running for Wisconsin attorney general, sent to his supporters. He attacked President Barack Obama as well as the three Democratic candidates for attorney general, singling out one of them in particular. ""Like President Obama, my Democrat opponents have no respect for the Constitution or rule of law,"" Schimel wrote. ""In fact, one of my opponents went so far to say he would only enforce the laws with which he personally agreed."" Schimel's campaign confirmed the reference was to state Rep. Jon Richards, D-Milwaukee. It’s an extreme claim. Has Richards said he would only enforce laws he agrees with? The AG race Richards and two district attorneys -- Susan Happ of Jefferson County and Ismael Ozanne of Dane County -- will compete in the Aug. 12, 2014 primary, with the winner facing Schimel, the Waukesha County district attorney, in the Nov. 4, 2014 general election. Republican incumbent J.B. Van Hollen is not seeking a third four-year term. All four candidates have stated they wouldn’t defend certain laws, saying they violate the state or U.S. constitution. That could saddle taxpayers with higher costs because private attorneys could be brought in to do that work. The three Democrats said they wouldn't defend or appeal rulings on the state's ban on gay marriage, its voter ID law, or recent abortion regulations. Schimel said he would not defend Wisconsin's domestic partnership law, which gives same-sex couples some of the rights of married couples. Those positions drew criticism from Madison lawyer Lester Pines, who supports Ozanne in the attorney general race. After social conservatives in 2009 sued to block the domestic partnership law, Van Hollen refused to defend it. Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle then hired Pines to defend the law. Wisconsin's attorney general has a legal and professional duty to defend every state law unless the only arguments that can be made on its behalf are frivolous, Pines told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in a June 14, 2014 article. Disliking a law or even believing a law is unconstitutional, he said, is not enough to abandon the duty to defend it. Schimel's claim Asked to provide evidence for Schimel’s claim, campaign manager Johnny Koremenos argued that Richards has two standards in deciding whether to defend a law, ""the Constitution and the ‘wishes of the people.’"" ""This signals he will disregard the law and replace it with his perception of the ‘wishes of the people,’"" Koremenos said. ""It’s clear he is willing to place his own values and personal beliefs above the Constitution."" Koremenos also cited several news articles. But only two of them, both from February 2014, contain comments from Richards about his personal beliefs. And in neither case does Richards say he would enforce only laws he agrees with. First, an article in the Madison weekly newspaper Isthmus -- about whether efforts to repeal Wisconsin’s ban on gay marriage could benefit Democrats in the fall 2014 elections -- noted that Richards said in a news release he would not defend the state’s ban on same-sex marriage, which voters added to the state constitution in 2006. Richards has said he believes the ban violates the U.S. constitution and that he personally favors allowing same-sex marriage. ""Given Richards’ proactive stance, it's clear he doesn’t see same-sex marriage as a negative on the campaign trail,"" the Isthmus article stated. The article also said Richards’ political director, Andy Suchorski, did not disagree with this assessment, but that Richards’ position is ""not a political thing for him. It’s something he really believes. It’s why we’re pushing it.’"" That might seem like support for Schimel’s claim. But only regarding one law and only if taken out of context. Suchorski told us he had been asked a political question -- whether Richards was talking about gay marriage in the campaign because it was good for Democrats -- and had not been asked any legal questions. And the article itself is framed as a political analysis. Schimel also pointed to the first paragraph of a brief version of an Associated Press news story, which stated Richards had pledged to be ""the people’s attorney general"" if elected, and that he said Richards wouldn’t defend every state law if he thinks it violates the U.S. Constitution or goes against the wishes of the people. So, that’s an indication that Richards might not defend some laws if he thinks they are against the public’s wishes, but not that he would defend only laws he supports. Indeed, the full version of the AP article noted that Richards said he would defend laws with which he disagrees, though he didn’t provide an example during that particular news conference. However, despite Schimel’s claim, Richards has actually stated that he would defend laws he doesn’t support if he believes they are constitutional. Richards campaign spokesman Sachin Chheda pointed to three such occasions: In March 2014, Richards told the Waukesha Freeman newspaper: ""There are going to be times when there are laws that I voted against and personally might not support but I believe are consistent with the state and United States constitution, so, of course, the Department of Justice will defend them in that situation."" In January 2014 on the ""Upfront with Mike Gousha"" public affairs TV show, Richards was asked if he would vigorously enforce the state’s voter ID law if it is upheld in court. Richards called the law ""troubling,"" but said:  ""Obviously, If the law is passed, and a court rules that it’s constitutional, we’ll uphold the law, of course. But I do think the law that’s written really needs some scrutiny."" Also in January 2014, Richards was asked by WisPolitics.com if concealed carry ""is the right thing for Wisconsin."" Richards said several aspects of the law were ""problematic"" in terms of public safety, but he added: ""Having said that, I mean, the law is in place and as attorney general I would certainly work to make sure that if people apply for a concealed weapons permit, that it’s handled in a professional manner, quickly and expeditiously, and that we obey the law and we get those permits issued.""

"""As Alaska’s attorney general, (U.S. Senate candidate Dan) Sullivan successfully fought to protect our Second Amendment rights and passed ‘stand your ground.’ ""","In his campaign for Senate, Republican front-runner Dan Sullivan touts his history of protecting Second Amendment rights in the hunting-loving state of Alaska. But a recent pro-Sullivan ad might have stretched the rifle and pistol expert’s record a little too far. ""As Alaska’s attorney general, Sullivan successfully fought to protect our Second Amendment rights and passed ‘stand your ground,’ "" said a recent radio ad out of the Sullivan campaign. In 2013, the Alaska Legislature passed a ""stand your ground"" law, which typically allows a person to use deadly force if they believe they face an imminent threat of serious bodily injury or death. More than 20 states have such laws. ""Stand your ground"" became a hot topic following George Zimmerman’s acquittal, after he claimed self-defense in his 2013 trial for killing Florida teenager Trayvon Martin. But Sullivan’s opponents -- Democrat and Republican -- have challenged his record, saying ""stand your ground"" legislation in Alaska wasn’t his doing. He’s running against incumbent Democrat Mark Begich and, on the Republican side, tea partier Joe Miller and Alaska Lt. Gov. Mead Treadwell. We decided to sort this out. ""Stand your ground"" was first introduced in the Alaska Legislature in 2010. At the time, Sullivan served as the state’s attorney general, heading an office that reviews every law moving through the Legislature. The original ""stand your ground"" bill failed to pass. A second iteration of the bill appeared and failed in 2011. Sullivan left the attorney general’s office to become the commissioner of natural resources at the end of 2010 -- long before a final version of the bill passed in 2013. So even though ""stand your ground"" first appeared in the Alaska Legislature when Sullivan was in a position to put his support behind it, it wasn’t successful until he had moved on to other positions. We came across one indication of Sullivan and the attorney general office’s position on ""stand your ground,"" but it doesn’t help his case. His office sent a letter in March 2010 that attacks the heart of ""stand your ground"" law. The letter uses strong language and primarily takes issue with the fact that the law would remove the then-existing ""duty to retreat."" ""Duty to retreat"" means that if a person believes that they are in imminent danger of death or severe bodily harm, but there is a safe way for them to get away, they are expected to retreat without assaulting or killing the person threatening them. ""Whatever source one thinks our laws should be drawn from -- the 10 commandments which say 'thou shalt not kill,' simple morality, utilitarianism principles of the greater good or simply the concept that life is sacred -- this bill would encourage the needless taking of human life,"" the letter reads. Although the letter seems to make Sullivan’s position fairly clear, he now has a twofold defense: First, his campaign says the letter took issue with the bill’s complexity, rather than ""stand your ground"" laws in general. That doesn’t seem to be the case. When we read the letter, we found that nearly half of it criticized the bill for nearly eliminating the duty to retreat -- contradicting the core of ""stand your ground,"" according to some experts. ""Duty to retreat"" and ""stand your ground"" laws cannot coexist, as the names suggest. ""Someone who opposes a self-defense statute that provides that there’s no ‘duty to retreat’ is also against a typical ‘stand your ground’ statute,"" said Eugene Volokh, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. To be fair, we also found that the letter brings up problems with specific language and lack of clarity, and it never says outright that the Legislature should abandon its efforts to pass ""stand your ground."" But it does say that the bill ""would promote violence and be a bad idea for (Alaska)."" Second, Sullivan says he did not pen or approve of the letter even though his name is included in the signature. (A then-assistant attorney general John Skidmore wrote it.) Sullivan’s name was included on any piece of paper that left his office -- even if he didn’t see it first. There are nearly 200 assistant attorneys general, and a lot of legislation passes through that office, so it is conceivable that he wasn’t aware that the letter was going out, said Cori Mills, spokeswoman for the Alaska Department of Law. However, Skidmore wasn’t the only assistant attorney general who had problems with the bill. About two weeks later -- after some tweaks had been made in response to the letter -- three other assistant attorney generals (all from different divisions) gave similar complaints on behalf of the Department of Law at a House Judiciary Committee hearing. The updated version made ""a bad bill better,"" said then-Assistant Attorney General Anne Carpeneti. We asked Sullivan’s campaign to point to any public statement showing his support for the law. They could only provide this letter from state Rep. Mark Neuman, R-Big Lake. The undated letter briefly mentions the attorney general’s office as supportive of the 2010 bill -- despite the obvious lingering complaints expressed at the hearing. The language in the final bill hasn’t changed since 2010, and the final bill still eliminated the duty to retreat in most circumstances. Our ruling A recent radio ad said, ""As Alaska’s Attorney General, Sullivan successfully fought to protect our Second Amendment rights and passed ‘stand your ground.’ "" We found that evidence of Sullivan’s support for ""stand your ground"" is dubious at best. We couldn’t find any public proof of his support, and multiple attorneys under him spoke out against the law. Even if he had publicly shown support for ""stand your ground,"" he wasn’t in a position to push the legislation forward when the law finally passed in 2013",False,"July 2, 2014"
An average of nine children a day in the U.S. die of gunshot wounds.,"Editor’s Note: We rarely find it necessary to re-examine a PolitiFact Oregon fact-check, but this was an exception. Our original fact-check, based  largely on data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, found that a claim by the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence was Mostly True. However, readers brought significant new information to light that we thought warranted a new analysis -- and ultimately a new ruling. We are committed to finding the facts even if they emerge after we’ve published. In the wake of the Reynolds High School shooting in Troutdale that left two students dead June 10, the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, one of the nation’s leading gun control advocacy groups, has once again been urging parents to lock up guns and ammunition in separate gun lockers. The claim: At a June 17, 2014, rally in Vancouver, Brady Campaign representatives claimed that, on average, nine children across the U.S. die every day from gunshot wounds. The group set up a display showing nine pairs of children’s shoes and a chalkboard that read: ""9 kids every day will never have another birthday."" Were Emilio Hoffman, the victim at Reynolds, and Jared Padgett, the shooter, just two of nine children who die from gun violence on any given day? PolitiFact Oregon wanted to find out. The analysis: In an email, Brady Campaign spokeswoman Jennifer Fuson said the number is based on a five-year average of government data recording children who died from gunshot wounds. The ages range from infants to 19. Using the same age range, we obtained the same numbers from an online database maintained by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. From 2007 to 2011, the most recent data available, 14,258 children died as a result of gunshot wounds. The circumstances range widely: accidental shootings by adults, kids who gained access to unsecured guns, gang violence, suicide and planned shootings like the incident at Reynolds High School on June 10, 2014. The numbers work out to 7.81 deaths a day, about one fewer than the Brady Campaign claimed. We presented this information to Heidi Yewman, a member of the national Brady Campaign board, who organized the rally. She acknowledged that the number presented at the rally was incorrect. A volunteer accidentally wrote the wrong number on the chalkboard display, she said. Nine children are unintentionally shot and survive every day, she said, but those children are in addition to the eight who are shot — intentionally and unintentionally — and die. ""It’s really important we don’t exaggerate the number, because it undermines what we’re saying,"" Yewman said in a phone interview. ""That was unfortunate and somewhat misleading."" She added: ""Certainly there was no conspiracy to mislead the public."" The national Brady Campaign spokeswoman confirmed the figure. ""It is correct to say that 8 children and teens die from gun violence every day,"" Fuson said in an email. ""It is also correct to say that 9 children and teens are shot unintentionally."" We checked the nonfatal number as well and found that 8.86 children are unintentionally shot each day and survive, according to the CDC’s nonfatal injuries database. But those two numbers — eight gun-related deaths and nine injuries per day — do not show the whole picture. PolitiFact Oregon obtained a breakdown by age from the CDC’s online database and found that about half of all youth gun deaths — 7,223 of 14,258 — are 18- and 19-year-olds. The same goes for unintentional injuries, roughly 46 percent of which — 7,479 of 16,172 — are 18- and 19-year-olds. Remove those two years from the calculation, and there are an average of 4.76 unintentional injuries each day and 3.85 deaths. That is significant given the use of the word ""children"" in the Brady Campaign’s display, along with a chalkboard and shoes suited to children younger than 12. In addition, people 18 and older are legally considered adults. They are allowed to buy guns and ammunition without parental consent, and are solely responsible for crimes they commit using those weapons. We asked Fuson, the Brady Campaign spokeswoman, to find out why the campaign includes 18- and 19-year-olds in its calculation. In an email, she said the campaign used the CDC’s own metrics for measuring unintentional injuries. She pointed us to a report published by the center examining childhood injuries from 2000-06. The CDC did use data for ages 0-19, including injuries. The center uses the same age range in The National Action Plan for Child Injury Prevention.   The CDC is the nation’s leading authority on mortality and injury statistics. The federal database includes information on thousands of death and emergency room records, and is regularly cited by lawmakers and activist groups. Data is categorized by four-year age ranges — 15-19 year olds, for example — in addition to many other metrics such as year, race and sex of victims. Users can also search the CDC website for statistics by any age or range. It is important to note, however, that the CDC says its data for unintentional gun injuries among children 16 and younger is shaky because the samples sizes are small. Another wrinkle: The agency has been caught in political cross-fire, with right-wing critics saying it collects and presents data in a way that supports gun-control efforts. Liberal supporters, meanwhile, say that criticism has had a chilling effect on CDC research into gun injuries and deaths. In short, not everyone agrees CDC data are unassailable. Last year, President Barack Obama ordered the CDC, in the wake of the Newtown, Connecticut, shootings, to begin studying the causes of gun violence. That information is not yet available. The ruling: At a rally in Vancouver, Brady Campaign representatives claimed that, on average, nine children across the U.S. die every day from gunshot wounds. The group set up a display showing nine pairs of children’s shoes and a chalkboard that read: ""9 kids every day will never have another birthday."" PolitiFact Oregon checked that claim against government data using the Brady Campaign’s age range of 0-19, and found that about 7.81 children and teens die each day from gun violence, based on the most recent five-year average available from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Heidi Yewman, who organized the rally in Vancouver, said the incorrect number was a volunteer’s mistake. We found the difference between eight and nine not hugely significant. It’s horrible that children are dying of gunshot wounds, of course, but the difference in the two numbers is unlikely to materially change the debate about gun control. But including 18- and 19-year-olds, who are not ""children"" under legal and other definitions, significantly skews the numbers, making the problem seem much worse than it is",Mostly False,"June 27, 2014"
"""The government -- not the armed forces -- is stockpiling hundreds of millions of rounds of ammunition for domestic use.""","Do Americans need to worry about the government stockpiling ammunition and assault rifles to quell coming uprisings? A number of political bloggers think so. A slew of chain emails and articles on conservative-leaning websites going back a year or more claim that the government’s stockpile of ammunition reaches into the billions of rounds. The claim: James Buchal, an Oregon Republican challenging Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore., clearly has concerns. His campaign website includes a photograph of an ominous-looking armored vehicle below copy in which Buchal says part of his campaign will ""focus on raising awareness of the threat to America’s future posed by an out-of-control total surveillance state."" He adds, ""The government -- and not the armed forces -- is stockpiling hundreds of millions of rounds of ammunition for domestic use."" Is the government stockpiling that much ammunition? PolitiFact Oregon checked. The analysis: We emailed Buchal, who pointed to a Government Accountability Office report released Feb. 12, 2014. The report, ""Ammunition Purchases Have Declined Since 2009,"" was produced in response to questions from U.S. Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla. In a letter dated Nov. 13, 2012, Coburn wrote to Janet Napolitano, then the head of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security: ""It has been reported that DHS has recently purchased large amounts of ammunition, as much or more than 1 billion rounds according to some estimates."" Some claims put the figure at 1.6 billion rounds. Another set had it at 2.7 billion. Still others fretted about the alleged retrofitting of more than 2,700 heavily armored military vehicles that were going to be turned over to domestic police forces. The GAO report found that as of October 2013, DHS had about 159 million rounds -- enough to meet the training and operational needs of its firearm-carrying personnel for about 22 months, it said. The agency has more than 70,000 armed personnel, the most of any federal agency, according to the report. The Department of Justice is second with 69,000 armed personnel. The DOJ reported its ammunition inventory as enough to last from 13 to 20 months. The report did not translate that to specific figures but provided other information that enabled it to calculate a range of about 90 million to about 138 million rounds. Together, those two agencies represent 80 percent of federal armed personnel, and together they have roughly 250 million to 300 million rounds of ammunition on hand. That may be on the low end of the figure that pops to mind when someone says ""hundreds of millions,"" but Buchal’s claim is accurate on the amount of ammunition the government has on hand. Then we looked at the thrust of Buchal’s claim, that the government is ""stockpiling"" the ammunition for some later use. DHS’s 159 million inventory in October was down from 178 million rounds in April 2013 and 193 million in November 2012, the GAO report found. We emailed DHS’s press office, which provided a statement saying DHS purchases dropped to 93 million rounds in fiscal 2012 and are projected at 75 million for fiscal 2014. Further, the GAO reported that DHS’ use of ammunition over the past six years has roughly equaled the amount it bought. In 2009, the agency bought 133 million rounds and dipped into reserves to use a total of 141 rounds. In 2013, the agency used 89 million rounds compared with new purchases of 84 million rounds. The report noted that DOJ purchasing trends and usage rates are similar. It also said DOJ’s inventories are below DHS’s. How is the ammunition used? The report noted that new federal officers go through 2,000 to 5,000 rounds a year, most of that in training and certification programs. Experienced officers use about 600 rounds a year. The email from DHS concluded, ""Although a small reserve in terms of the overall ammunition is usually kept by the component law enforcement agencies, most do not have the capability to store large amounts of ammunition. There is not an ammunition stockpile."" Buchal acknowledged the report’s assertion that purchases have declined but added, ""The available information is not sufficient, at least to me, to demonstrate that the levels of ammunition purchases are appropriate."" When asked, he did not make a distinction between an ""inventory"" and a ""stockpile."" In a final email, Buchal said the distinction may be beside the point. ""Bottom line, in all likelihood, the ammunition will only be used for training purposes, but engaging in such broad-scale training is itself a problem,"" he wrote. ""We don’t need SWAT teams to deal with student loan fraud, and training up vast quantities of SWAT teams to deal with such issues is itself a sign of a growing divide between the government and the people."" The ruling: On his campaign website, U.S. House candidate James Buchal claims that the government ""is stockpiling hundreds of millions of rounds of ammunition for domestic use."" A government report indicated that the federal Department of Homeland Security, as of October 2013, had an estimated 159 million rounds in inventory, down from 178 million rounds in April 2013 and 193 million in November 2012. The report also found that DHS and Department of Justice -- which employ 80 percent of the federal government’s armed personnel -- have steadily decreased ammunition purchases since 2009. Projected purchases by DHS for this year will be the lowest in more than five years. Estimated ammunition inventories for both agencies also continue to fall. With inventories and purchases going down, and usage roughly equaling purchases, the government is clearly not ""stockpiling"" ammunition. And while Buchal is correct in his assertion that the government has ""hundreds of millions"" of rounds on hand, even he later acknowledged that ""in all likelihood,"" those rounds are being used for training purposes",False,"June 27, 2014"
"The U.N. Arms Treaty ""infringes upon our right to keep and bear arms.""","From universal background checks to limits on magazine capacities, gun-control proposals are among the surest ways to stir controversy. Some Second Amendment activists are convinced there is yet another threat to gun ownership that comes not from the U.S. government but from the United Nations. The claim: U.S. Senate candidate Monica Wehby, a Republican, is running against Oregon’s Democratic incumbent Jeff Merkley. On her website, Wehby addresses gun ownership, singling out a U.N. proposal long been opposed by the National Rifle Association and many other pro-gun groups. She promises to oppose the U.N. Arms Trade Treaty, her statement says, because it ""infringes upon our right to keep and bear arms."" If adopted, would it have that effect in the U.S.? We decided to check. The analysis: We emailed Wehby’s campaign and asked how this U.N. treaty would affect gun ownership in the United States. Michael Antonopoulos, the candidate’s new campaign manager, replied: ""Dr. Wehby is an unapologetic defender of second amendment rights and will always oppose any effort (to) infringe on them when she is in the Unites States Senate."" He added that nine Democratic senators share Wehby’s concerns about the treaty but provided no additional information on how the treaty itself would infringe on U.S. gun rights. We checked PolitiFact National’s database for some background on what the treaty is and what it does. The formally named Arms Trade Treaty, which took seven years to negotiate, was adopted by the U.N.’s General Assembly on April 2, 2013. The vote was 154 in favor, three opposed and 23 absent. The U.S. voted for it, with North Korea, Iran and Syria opposed. The treaty requires each participating country to establish its own controls over the export of ammunition and conventional arms, PolitiFact Virginia found. The pact prohibits sending the weapons to nations that are under a U.N. arms embargo or where the arms will be used for terrorism, genocide, crimes against humanity, breaches of the Geneva Conventions, attacks against civilians or other war crimes. It has no enforcement power, but backers hope it will create common standards for international trade of weapons. To take effect, the pact must be ratified by the governments of 50 U.N. nations. To date, it has been ratified by 36. So does it contain language that would somehow infringe on gun-ownership rights of U.S. citizens, as Wehby’s website claims? The pact’s preamble affirms ""the sovereign right of any State to regulate and control conventional arms exclusively within its territory, pursuant to its own legal or constitutional system."" We emailed the U.S. State Department and asked for its position on the treaty. Press officer Drew Bailey sent us a synopsis, which included this point: ""Nothing in the Arms Trade Treaty is inconsistent with the rights of U.S. citizens, including those protected by the Second Amendment."" Some pro-gun advocates, however, remain unconvinced. The conservative Heritage Foundation, for instance, has called for hearings into the Arms Trade Treaty and its potential reach. The group also notes, correctly, that a Senate majority, including some Democrats, opposes ratifying the pact. The National Rifle Association issued a statement after Secretary of State John Kerry signed the treaty saying it ""threatens individual firearm ownership and an invasive registration scheme."" Despite all signs to the contrary, the NRA and other groups opposed to the treaty insist it will create a slippery slope leading to a national gun registry. However, previous PolitiFact checks don’t back that up. PolitiFact Georgia, in an Aug. 12, 2012 story, interviewed legal experts and concluded, ""...even in the unlikely event that the U.N. creates a treaty that provides for domestic registries and the U.S. Senate ratifies it, it would not 'almost certainly force' the U.S. to create one,"" as a Georgia congressman had alleged. The ruling: Oregon Republican U.S. Senate candidate Monica Wehby’s website, in addressing the Second Amendment, says she opposes an international arms treaty passed by the U.N., and signed by the United States, because it ""infringes on our right to keep and bear arms."" A Wehby spokesman did not elaborate on how or why any infringement could come about, but did restate the candidate’s support for the Second Amendment. He did not return phone calls or emails asking exactly how the treaty would infringe on the gun rights of U.S. citizens Previous fact-checks looking at this claim found it lacked merit. Language in the treaty itself specifically leaves gun-control and ownership decisions up to member nations. The claim is all flash and no powder",False,"June 20, 2014"
"""Gun homicide is down 49 percent in the past 12 years.""","In the social media wars over gun control, a new social-media meme makes the case that gun violence is wildly exaggerated by the media. ""Gun homicide is down 49 percent in the past 12 years. Only 12 percent of Americans know that. Tell us again how unbiased our media is,"" the Facebook post said. A reader sent us the posting and asked us to fact-check it. We’ll focus our attention on the claim about gun homicides, but we’ll also touch on the media question later on. Trends in gun homicide We began by looking at year-by-year statistics on gun homicides compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Since the meme’s language was clear about focusing on ""homicides,"" we didn’t include statistics for suicides, gun shootings with undetermined causes, or ""legal interventions,"" such as justified shootings by police. The most recent data is for 2010, so we went as far back as 1998 to define the 12-year period. This table summarizes what we found:   Year Gun homicides Gun homicides per 100,000 people 1998 11,798 4.28 1999 10,828 3.88 2000 10,801 3.84 2001 11,348 3.98 2002 11,829 4.11 2003 11,920 4.11 2004 11,624 3.97 2005 12,352 4.18 2006 12,791 4.29 2007 12,632 4.19 2008 12,179 4.01 2009 11,493 3.75 2010 11,078 3.59   This disproves the clear wording of the meme. Over the past 12 years, the number of gun homicides is down 6 percent, and the rate of gun homicides is down 16 percent. Both are well below the 49 percent claimed in the post. However, we also found that the statistic did come from somewhere. The 49 percent decline emerged from 2013 report by the Pew Research Center. It found that gun homicides (or more specifically, the rate of gun homicides per 100,000 residents) had declined by 49 percent between their peak in 1993 and 2010, a period of 17 years. We double-checked Pew’s calculations of the CDC figures and found that they were correct. Between 1993 and 2010, the gun homicide rate fell from 7.02 per 100,000 to 3.59 per 100,000, or a decline of precisely 49 percent. Here’s the rundown of those earlier years:   Year Gun homicides Gun homicides per 100,000 people 1992 17,488 6.82 1993 18,253 7.02 1994 17,527 6.66 1995 15,551 5.84 1996 14,037 5.21 1997 13,252 4.86   It’s possible to chalk this mistake up to a simple typo -- after all, if the claim had said 17 years rather than 12, it would have been correct. However, the time frame raises important issues. For one thing, the CDC data show that the big decline in gun homicides came between 1993 and 2000, which happens to coincide with the years Bill Clinton was president. While Clinton and his policies are hardly the only reason for this decline, his signing of tighter gun-control legislation makes him unpopular among the kinds of gun supporters who might have created this meme. By contrast, by framing the decline as happening over the past 12 years, the meme implies that George W. Bush -- a president much more friendly to gun-rights supporters -- can take some credit for the decline.      More importantly, by making this mistake, the meme misunderstands the overall trend lines of gun homicides. Gun homicides didn’t decline 49 percent over the last 12 years -- rather, they declined precipitously over six years in the 1990s, then have remained basically stagnant for the past decade or so. Why is this important? Because the decline, to a large degree, has to do with a specific reason -- the end of the crack epidemic. The decline in gun homicides in the 1990s ""was largely a reversal of an upward trend that occurred in the mid-to-late 1980s,"" said James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University. ""There would not have been much of a downturn were it not for the surge. This up-and-down change was primarily in cities and among offenders under age 25, and indeed have much to do with crack markets and gang activity."" In fact, the Pew study made the same point, noting that ""by the early 1990s, crack markets withered in part because of lessened demand, and the vibrant national economy made it easier for even low-skilled young people to find jobs rather than get involved in crime. At the same time, a rising number of people ages 30 and older were incarcerated, due in part to stricter laws, which helped restrain violence among this age group."" Fox said another reason for the decline in gun homicides overall was a specific decline in cases that involved intimate partners. After 1993, when the pro-gun-control Brady Law was passed, ""there was a decline in gun homicides by women against their partners, but no decline in non-gun killings,"" he said. Media bias? The meme also takes a shot at the media for burying this large decline. But that’s not deserved. Just the first two pages of Google search results show articles about the Pew study appearing in the following outlets: • Associated Press • Washington Post • CNN • NPR • NBC News • Yahoo News Oh, and PolitiFact. As for the claim that ""only 12 percent of Americans know that,"" the meme got the percentage right, though of course it got the substance of what that 12 percent knew wrong. ""Despite national attention to the issue of firearm violence, most Americans are unaware that gun crime is lower today than it was two decades ago,"" the report said. ""According to a new Pew Research Center survey, today 56 percent of Americans believe gun crime is higher than 20 years ago and only 12 percent think it is lower."" Our ruling The social media meme said that ""gun homicide is down 49 percent in the past 12 years."" The gun homicide rate is actually down by 49 percent over the past 17 years, but this seemingly minor mistake betrays a significant misunderstanding of how rates have fluctuated over the past two decades. During the past dozen years, gun homicide rates have been largely static; their big decline mostly came in the years before the meme even started counting. The meme is not just incorrect; it’s a distraction from what actually happened",False,"June 16, 2014"
"Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine voted ""to let the U.N. take OUR guns.""","A chain email lists Virginia Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine among 46 ""legistraitors"" in the U.S. Senate who voted to let the United Nations seize the guns of Americans. ""Folks: This needs to go viral,"" the email said. ""These Senators voted to let the UN take OUR guns. They need to lose their next election. We have been betrayed."" A reader recently sent us the dispatch and asked if it is true. We took a look, mindful that Warner, a Democrat, is up for reelection this fall. No group or individual takes credit for the email, which denounces the Arms Trade Treaty adopted by the U.N.’s General Assembly on April 2, 2013. The vote was 154 in favor, 3 opposed and 23 absent. The U.S. voted for it, while North Korea, Iran and Syria opposed it. The treaty, which took seven years to negotiate, is aimed at restricting the international flow of large and small arms to nations beset by terrorists or dictators with poor human rights records. President Barack Obama said he would sign the pact. But before the U.S. can be bound by any treaty, the agreement must be approved by the Senate. The U.N. treaty had long been opposed by the National Rifle Association and many other pro-gun groups, who said it could infringe on constitutional rights to own arms in the United States. Before the U.N’s approval of the accord, the Senate passed legislation, by a 53-46 vote, stating opposition to the treaty. Warner and Kaine voted with the minority that favored the pact. The email says that the treaty, in addition to allowing the U.N. to seize guns, ""would have effectively placed a global ban on the import and export of small firearms. The ban would have affected all private gun owners in the U.S. and had language that would have implemented an international gun registry, now get this, on all private guns and ammo."" Facts about the treaty Let’s look at the what the treaty actually does. It states its purpose is to ""establish the highest possible common international standards for regulating or improving the regulation of the international trade in conventional arms"" and to ""prevent and eradicate the illicit trade in conventional arms and prevent their diversion."" It requires each participating country to establish its own controls over the export of ammunition and conventional arms. The pact prohibits sending the weapons to nations that are under a U.N. arms embargo or where the arms will be used for terrorism, genocide, crimes against humanity, breaches of the Geneva Conventions, attacks against civilians or other war crimes. The treaty calls on participating nations to take ""appropriate measures"" if they determine that a shipment has been diverted, although it does not clearly define those steps. The accord applies to tanks, armored combat vehicles, artillery, combat aircraft and helicopters, warships, missiles, missile launchers and small arms such and handguns and rifles. Participating nations would be required to send annual reports to the U.N. on their imports and exports of conventional weapons. The treaty has no enforcement power, but supporters hope it will create common standards among countries for international trade of weapons. To go into effect, the pact must be ratified by the governments of 50 U.N. nations. To date, it has been ratified by 36 countries. The U.S. State Department says the treaty, if joined by the United States, would not put additional controls on the import or export of guns in America. Instead, it would require other countries to establish ""control systems that are closer to the high standard the United States already sets with its own national standards,"" the State Department wrote in a fact sheet last September. What about the email’s contentions that the treaty would ""let the U.N. take OUR guns,"" and ""implement and international gun registry ... on all guns and private ammo?"" There are no provisions for any of that in the treaty. To the contrary, the pact’s preamble affirms ""the sovereign right of any State to regulate and control conventional arms exclusively within its territory, pursuant to its own legal or constitutional system."" Our ruling A chain email says Warner and Kaine were among 46 senators who voted to ""let the U.N. take our guns."" This is a wild distortion of the senators’ support for a U.N. Arms Trade Treaty that has no enforcement power but encourages nations to adopt common standards to block the flow of arms into nations beset by terrorists or dictators with brutal human rights records. The goal is to raise the international arms trade rules to standards already used by the United States. The treaty explicitly recognizes the sovereign rights of nations to control gun laws within its borders. So the assertion that the U.N. would be empowered to take guns from United States citizens is outlandish",False Pants on Fire,"June 15, 2014"
"There have been 74 ""school shootings in America since Sandy Hook.""","After an Oregon high school freshman armed with an assault rifle injured a teacher, killed a student and killed himself Tuesday, a striking statistic began circulating on the internet. It said that at least 74 school shootings had occurred since December 2012, when an assault on Sandy Hook Elementary School by Adam Lanza left 28 dead, including Lanza and his mother. The statistic came from Everytown for Gun Safety, an advocacy group founded by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and gun-control advocate Shannon Watts. That comes out to more than one school shooting per week. Numerous media outlets reported the 74 school shootings figure, and the number spread widely in Facebook posts and through other forms of social media. Even President Barack Obama brought up the once-a-week line in an interview with Tumblr CEO David Karp. In the interview, Obama discussed his frustration with lawmakers’ inaction on gun control legislation, particularly in the wake of Sandy Hook. While it’s not clear that Obama was specifically referencing the statistic compiled by Everytown, his comment was in line with their math. ""We’re the only developed country on Earth where this happens,"" he said,
""and it happens now once a week."" But as widely as the number spread, it also attracted criticism. Charles Johnson, who writes for the conservative Daily Caller, garnered attention for what he considered a debunking of the Everytown list. We decided to sift through the numbers ourselves. How Everytown counted 74 incidents To its credit, Everytown provided details on each of the 74 shootings, including the date, city and school location. The group also clearly laid out its methodology at the bottom of the list. These make it possible for the critics -- and us -- to look under the hood at its calculations. The main reason for the criticism of Everytown’s count is that its definition of ""school shooting"" is relatively broad. The group’s criteria goes beyond what many people would consider ""school shootings"" -- incidents in which a student or an intruder enters a school and fires at innocent students and staff. For many people, this is the first thing that comes to mind when they hear the phrase ""school shooting"" -- an incident such as Sandy Hook or, before it, the 1999 Columbine shooting in Colorado that left 15 dead, including the shooters. Here’s the methodology as explained by the group at the bottom of the list: Incidents were classified as school shootings when a firearm was discharged inside a school building or on school or campus grounds, as documented in publicly reported news accounts. This includes assaults, homicides, suicides, and accidental shootings. Incidents in which guns were brought into schools but not fired there, or were fired off school grounds after having been possessed in schools, were not included.... Incidents were identified through media reports, so this is likely an undercount of the true total. This definition allows for incidents that don’t typically call to mind the term ""school shooting"" -- for example, a case in which a man unaffiliated with Alogna High/Middle School in Iowa killed himself in the school’s parking lot in the middle of the night, or an early-morning armed robbery on a street that goes through the Marquette University campus in Wisconsin. Both count in Everytown’s tally. Clearly it is difficult to draw lines. The Everytown list did not include the recent and highly publicized shooting spree in Isla Vista, Calif. In that case, the shooter was a student at the University of California at Santa Barbara, and he targeted other students, including women living in a sorority house near the campus. Seven people died, but the shooting wasn’t technically on campus, so it didn’t make the list. Our Breakdown We reviewed news reports for all 74 shootings and did our best to sort them into five categories. Here’s our breakdown. (See individual shootings by category here, with clickable links to news reports on each shooting.) • Incidents such as Sandy Hook or Columbine in which the shooter intended to commit mass murder: 10 instances • Incidents related to criminal activity (such as drug dealing or robbery), or personal altercations: 39 instances • Incidents unconnected to members of school community and/or that took place outside school hours: 16 instances • Suicides: 6 instances • Accidental discharges: 3 instances In all, these 74 incidents resulted in 38 deaths and 53 injuries. The biggest death toll in one incident was a shooting spree that ended at Santa Monica College. Six people died, though not all of them took place on the campus. While the list includes a lot of gunfire, deaths and injuries, only about 14 percent were shootings that mirrored Columbine and Sandy Hook. In addition, almost half -- 35 -- occurred at a college or university rather than a K-12 school. This clashes with the imagery invoked by the line in the chart’s introduction, that ""we should feel secure in sending our children to school — comforted by the knowledge that they’re safe."" We asked James Fox, a criminology professor at Northeastern University, for some perspective. He pointed to the 2013 ""Indicators of School Crime and Safety"" report compiled by the Bureau of Justice Statistics. There were about 45 school-associated violent deaths (not just by guns) at elementary and secondary schools each year between the 1992 and 2010 school years, according to the report. The highest annual total was 63 deaths in 2006-07, while the lowest was 31 in 2010-11. In other words, Fox said, the number of gun deaths documented by Everytown over the past year and a half are not out of the ordinary. About 15 to 20 kids in grades K-12 are killed at school each year, along with a similar number of college students, he said. Is it misleading? The experts we consulted agreed that Everytown’s broad definition of ""school shooting"" could be misleading, encouraging them to assume that there have been 74 incidents similar to Columbine or Sandy Hook. While the Everytown definition is certainly one way of calculating it, there is such a range of motivations, degrees of planning and outcomes that it ceases to be an especially useful measurement, said Jay Corzine, a University of Central Florida sociology professor. Mark Safarik, president of Forensic Behavioral Services Inc. and a former member of the FBI Behavioral Analysis Unit, agreed that when the average person thinks of a school shooting, they think of a mass murder like Sandy Hook. ""There is an ocean of difference between Sandy Hook, Virginia Tech and Columbine and a depressed student who (commits suicide) at school, or an accidental discharge,"" Safarik said. ""To call them all school shootings may be true in a technical sense but is quite disingenuous on an emotional level, which is where they are trying to capture for their audience."" Everytown has countered the media criticism by arguing that focusing too closely on Sandy Hook-like incidents unfairly diminishes the full extent of the dangers to students and staff posed by guns in or near schools. ""The country's gun-violence epidemic has seeped into our children's schools, and that is a problem, regardless of the body count,"" said spokeswoman Erika Lamb. ""Those lives count, too, even if the media is only focused on mass tragedies."" Corzine prefers the designation used by the New York Police Department, among others -- ""active shooter,"" which limits the list to incidents that occur during school hours, involving a firearm discharged with the intent to kill or injure others on school grounds or while in transit on a school vehicle. In addition, Fox said the statistic is misleading for another reason -- it focuses on short-term patterns, rather than long-term trends. Despite the media focus, Fox said, it’s worth noting that the number of school-related homicides has remained relatively flat for two decades, he said. ""I don't mean to minimize the horror of these events or the pain and suffering of victims, but schools are safe, safer than other places that our children spend time,"" he said. ""For some kids, school is even safer than their home."" Corzine said he sees some value in Everytown’s calculations -- but also pitfalls. On the one hand, ""they are a valid indicator of the ease with which firearms enter the school environment in the United States compared to other highly developed nations."" By the same token, though, ""it is misleading to use the 74 school shootings in a context that explicitly or implicitly equates them with Sandy Hook."" Our ruling A statistic calculated by Everytown for Gun Safety, and shared widely on social media, said that there have been 74 ""school shootings in America since Sandy Hook."" The group’s figure is accurate only if you use a broad definition of ""school shooting"" that includes such incidents as suicides, accidents and spillover from adjacent criminal activity. The figure has some value in quantifying the proximity of guns to school campuses, but the group makes a significant stretch by tying the statistic so closely to the mass shooting at Sandy Hook. By doing this, the group closely associates the statistic with planned mass shootings targeting students and school staff -- a category that, using a more strict definition, accounts for only 10 of the 74 incidents. The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression",Mostly False,"June 13, 2014"
"Says when armed civilians stop mass shootings with guns, an average of 2.5 people die; otherwise, an average of 18 people die.","As a longtime gun owner, New Hampshire Republican Jim Rubens made his support for Second Amendment rights one of the early themes of his campaign for U.S. Senate. Rubens launched a ""2nd Amendment Protection Tour"" earlier this year, traveling to gun shops around the state to pledge his support for firearms owners. It was a move that invited comparisons between himself and the man he views as his strongest challenger in the GOP primary, former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown. Brown has voiced support for increased gun control after the school shooting in Newtown, Conn., and has since faced blowback from gun owners in New Hampshire. During a stop at Lee’s Gun Shop in Hudson, Rubens said he would oppose a ban on assault weapons or high-capacity magazines if voters send him to Washington to replace Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen. Rubens also provided recommendations to address gun violence and mass shootings, such as encouraging schools to hire armed security personnel. The presence of armed civilians would send the message that shooters won’t achieve their aims, he said. ""In mass shooting incidents where you had a person inside the premises during the incident, you have an average of 2.5 people killed if there is someone with a firearm able to stop the crime in progress,"" he said. ""In similar instances where there’s no such person with a firearm, you have an average of 18 people killed and dead as a result of it."" This seemed like a sharp contrast, so we asked Rubens to back up his claim about shooting deaths. His campaign pointed us to an article by Davi Barker, who runs a website called Daily Anarchist. In July 2012, Barker wrote that he studied several mass shootings and determined the average number of people killed in mass shootings when the shooter is stopped by police is 18.25. ""I based it on 10 shootings I found listed on some timeline somewhere,"" he wrote. ""I honestly don’t even remember where."" Barker was challenged when he posted these statistics on Facebook, leading him to conduct a more thorough study, according to his website. After reviewing 100 ""rampage shooting"" incidents, Barker revised his calculations, claiming that the number of people killed when the shooter is stopped by police is really closer to 14.29. He pegged the average for incidents in which civilians stop the shooter at 2.33. The Rubens campaign acknowledged that the figures he provided were incorrect, saying that Rubens now stands behind Barker’s latest figures. ""Bottom line remains: an on-premises armed citizen saves lives in a shooting rampage in a public place,"" communications director Brian Tilton wrote in an email. We looked for a separate analysis of shooting incidents to determine whether those casualty figures are accurate. One of the best sources we found is an academic study published in January in an FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin by Dr. Pete Blair, director of research for the Advanced Law Enforcement Rapid Response Training Center (ALERRT) and an associate professor of criminal justice at Texas State University. Blair and two other researchers examined more than 100 shootings between 2000 and 2012, investigating factors such as the average response time of law enforcement and the outcomes based on the actions taken by civilians at the scene. Looking at ""active shooter"" incidents, the study found the median number of people shot is five (excluding the perpetrator). Blair said shooting incidents that lead to deaths in the range of 18 people -- the number Rubens initially offered -- are rare. ""Eighteen would be really out there,"" he said. The study documented only nine incidents in which the number of people killed or wounded was 14 or higher. Blair also pointed out problems with the terminology Rubens used in his statement. The term ""mass shooting"" is widely understood to mean an incident in which four or more people are shot, he said. Therefore, incidents in which only two or three people are shot -- the average Rubens offered when civilians take action -- would generally be excluded from the category of mass shootings. Blair said it’s logical to assume casualties would be lower when civilians intervene before police arrive, but his research documented very few incidents that were actually stopped because a civilian was carrying a gun. Roughly half of all active shooter events Blair studied ended before law enforcement officers arrived. The most common occurrence was that the shooter stopped the attack spontaneously on their own. The decision was often made after an initial burst of violence, in which the shooter attacked everyone who was in the immediate area, Blair said. When those who remained either ran away or barricaded themselves in secure areas, shooters often made the decision to leave the attack site or commit suicide, he said. Blair said he also documented cases in which civilians took direct action. Civilians stopped about one out of every six active shooter events, but their actions rarely involved the use of firearms, he said. The most common method was tackling the attacker, as was the case during a campus shooting in Seattle this week. Blair said he found only three cases in which an armed civilian shot the attacker, and in two of those incidents, the civilian who took action was an off-duty police officer. Blair said it would be difficult to draw any conclusions about the effectiveness of armed civilians in stopping active shooter events based on the limited data that exists. In general though, Blair said, fewer people were killed or injured in the events that ended before police showed up at the scene -- either because civilians took action, or because the shooter spontaneously stopped or committed suicide. Data suggests the best course of action for civilians is first to avoid the attacker, and if that’s not possible, to deny access by barricading themselves in locked rooms or other secure areas. Blair teaches training courses for law enforcement and civilians on how to respond to active shooter events through ALERRT, which receives funding from the Bureau of Justice Administration at the U.S. Department of Justice and from the Texas governor’s office. Blair said he encourages civilians to take physical action to defend themselves only when it’s impossible to escape. ""We see the firearm as being an adjunct to that part,"" he said. Blair said there are pros and cons to having armed civilians at the scene of a shooting. Confronting the shooter with a gun would likely provide the fastest resolution, he said. But if multiple civilians are wielding guns at the scene, it could also create confusion about who the shooter is -- particularly for police who are arriving to render aid. Our ruling Rubens said when armed civilians stop mass shootings with guns, an average of 2.5 people die; otherwise, an average of 18 people die. One of the most comprehensive studies of recent active shooter events suggests the average of 18 deaths when police stop the shooter is far too high. The study of more than 100 incidents determined the median number of people killed or wounded in all active shooter situations was five. The study documented only nine incidents out of dozens in which the number of people shot was 14 or higher. Conclusions about the number of deaths when an armed civilian takes action are also problematic because very limited data exists. The author of the study agrees it’s logical to assume casualties would be lower when civilians intervene before police arrive, but his research documented very few incidents that were actually stopped because a civilian was carrying a gun. Finally, both Rubens and the internet blogger who first offered the statistics that Rubens cited have acknowledged the figures were incorrect. Rubens has since revised his estimate to be in the range of 2.33 and 14. Overall, this statement is not accurate",False,"June 6, 2014"
"""Public display of a long rifle is perfectly legal in Texas.""","Meanwhile in Texas, there’s been talk of gun-rights delegates to the state convention of the Republican Party of Texas strolling around its Fort Worth gathering place with long rifles in hand. Not so fast, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram said in a news story posted online May 31, 2014. The story quoted city officials as saying those weapons could legally be toted outside the Fort Worth Convention Center but inside, ""it’s a different matter because there’s a Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission license. ""State officials have been reminding Texans that any business with a state permit to serve alcohol may not knowingly let people carry long guns,"" the paper said. Broadly a few days later, Mike Hashimoto, an editorial columnist for the Dallas Morning News, took exception to Texans strolling around with rifles in a commentary, describing them as ""chuckleheads strapping on their long rifles and marching into the local Chipotle or Chili’s or Home Depot. Whatever point they may have about gun-owner rights or Texas law they drown in look-at-me stupidity."" Hashimoto kicked us into action with this factual claim: ""Public display of a long rifle is perfectly legal in Texas."" Really? Up front, we recognized numerous news accounts have said the same, including a June 2, 2014, Austin American-Statesman story stating: ""Texas law allows owners to openly carry rifles but not sidearms in most situations."" Similarly, the National Rifle Association brought up what the law permits in a May 30, 2014, blog post questioning the ""unneighborly"" actions of individuals trying to make Second Amendment points by hauling rifles into coffee shops and restaurants. ""Texas, independent-minded and liberty-loving place that it is, doesn't ban the carrying of loaded long guns in public, nor does it require a permit for this activity,"" the association said. Seeking statutory detail, we reached the legislative director of the Texas State Rifle Association, Alice Gene Tripp, who told us the Texas penal code restricts handguns, but it’s silent per toting long rifles and shotguns. Tripp pointed us to Section 46.02 of the code. By email, Hashimoto also singled out that section, saying it put limits on handguns, illegal knives and clubs, among specific weapons, not mentioning long rifles or shotguns. ""From discussing this over the years with law enforcement officials, my understanding is that rifles and shotguns, therefore, were legal for open carry in Texas,"" Hashimoto said. ""I've not questioned that understanding recently, as open-carry demonstrations have become more common, yet demonstrators, generally, have not been arrested for unlawfully carrying weapons."" Section 46.02 states it’s at least a Class A misdemeanor if a person ""intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly carries on or about his or her person a handgun, illegal knife, or club if the person is not on the person’s own premises or premises under the person’s control or in or directly en route to a motor vehicle""(including a recreational vehicle ""or boat they own or control."" Finally, we contacted Jerry Patterson, the state land commissioner who as a state senator authored the 1995 law enabling Texans to carry concealed handguns with state permits. By email, Patterson said: ""Long gun ‘open carry’ has never been unlawful in Texas to my knowledge. How do you use a shotgun or rifle if you can't carry it openly?‎ Would you have to wrap it up if you placed it in your pickup gun rack?"" Still, he pointed out  out section 42.01 (a) (8) of the penal code, which states a person commits an offense if he intentionally or knowingly ""displays a firearm or other deadly weapon in a public place in a manner calculated to alarm."" Our ruling Hashimoto wrote: ""Public display of a long rifle is perfectly legal in Texas."" Texas law explicitly restricts handguns and some other weapons from being openly carried around. But the law is silent on long rifles. Generally, another provision says no one should display a firearm in a manner calculated to alarm",True,"June 5, 2014"
"From 2000 to 2008, we averaged ""about five mass shootings a year. We're now averaging 15. So that's a three-fold increase.""","The brutal murders May 23, 2014, near the campus of the University of California, Santa Barbara, dominated the national news and provoked a lot of talk about what could have been done to save the lives of six young college-aged victims. The public quickly learned the basics. The killer had a history of mental illness. He revealed his plans in a YouTube video posted shortly before his rampage. He killed his first three victims, his roommates, with a knife. He legally owned three handguns and used at least one of them to kill three strangers before committing suicide. In a search for some pattern, ABC’s This Week host, Martha Raddatz asked ABC senior justice correspondent Pierre Thomas about deadly gunfire on or near college campuses since 1996. ""Officials you talk to say there really is a spike nationwide,"" Raddatz said. ""The problem is, it's even bigger than that,"" Thomas said. ""Between 2008 and 2000 roughly, we were averaging about five mass shootings a year. We're now averaging 15. So that's a three-fold increase."" That seemed like a major jump. Does the country really have three times as many mass shootings? We decided to take a closer look. We reached out to Thomas to learn what background information he was using and did not hear back. However, we found an FBI study that, while it ultimately doesn’t support his claim, does offer some numbers that sound very much like the ones Thomas used. Pete Blair, director of the Advanced Law Enforcement Rapid Response Training Center at Texas State University was the lead researcher on the study Active Shooter Events from 2000 to 2012. Blair found that from 2000 to 2008, there were about five events each year where someone with a gun attempted to kill multiple people. But after 2008 there were nearly 16 each year. That matches the tripling that Thomas described. The problem is, Thomas talked about mass shootings. That’s not the violence Blair studied. In about 20 percent the cases Blair looked at, no one died. In more than 10 percent of the cases, only one person was killed. Neither scenario meets the definition of a mass shooting. Blair explained that the FBI’s focus was on crafting strategies to save lives once a gunman arrives. ""Active shooter is a response protocol for the police,"" Blair said. ""We believe that we can learn as much from events that do not turn into mass killings as those that do."" Blair found that about half the time, the incidents are over before police arrive and the most common reason is that the shooter commits suicide. In research circles, there is no hard and fast definition for a mass shooting. Instead, the FBI uses the term ""mass murder"" when four or more people are killed in what is essentially a single episode. By that definition, Blair said there has been no increase in mass shootings. James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University in Boston, told PunditFact the rate of mass murders has held steady for decades. ""Since 1976, we’ve averaged about 20 cases a year,"" Fox said. ""On average, about 100 people a year are killed by mass murderers."" The data on killings is fraught with analytic pitfalls. USA Today researchers found that the FBI’s homicide data is accurate only about 60 percent of the time. On top of that, different studies look at different kinds of events. For example, Fox includes killings within families and murders committed during burglaries in his tally. In contrast, the magazine Mother Jones did an extensive investigation that aimed to identify instances where at least four people were murdered and the motive was indiscriminate killing in a public setting. Researchers eliminated cases where the violence took place in a home or was tied to a robbery or gang warfare. (Those standards might exclude the Santa Barbara slayings because three of the victims were the killer’s roommates and were slain in their apartment. Nor would it be correct to call them shootings because they were stabbed to death.) Using its approach, Mother Jones found that the rate of these killings has gone up over time. During the period 2000 to 2008, there were 1.8 mass murders a year. From 2009 to 2013, the rate doubled to 3.6 events per year. This shows an increase, but not as large as Thomas suggested. There’s another way to slice the data. Criminologist Gary Kleck at Florida State University went beyond homicides and focused on any event in which seven or more people were killed or injured in a single location. By his tally, the yearly average between 2000 and 2008 was 2.4 events, compared to 5 events per year after 2008. This offers some support for Thomas’s statement but again, the numbers are quite different from the ones he used. Our ruling Thomas said that mass shootings have tripled since the 2000 to 2008 period and the country now sees about 15 episodes a year. The study that matches those figures looked at a different form of violence and included instances where no one was murdered. The study’s author told us that mass murders, as defined by the FBI, have not increased. Using a more narrow definition, Mother Jones found that the country now has between three and four mass killings a year, a doubling since about a decade ago. Another study that looked at the number of people wounded, not necessarily killed, offered similar results. The annual rate is much lower than Thomas said and the change in the rate is also considerably less. There is some evidence that mass killings have increased but that finding hinges on a careful choice of incidents, and by any measure, Thomas’ numbers are way off",Mostly False,"May 28, 2014"
"""20 percent of the time (smart guns) won't work.""","The debate over ""smart guns"" doesn’t always turn up accurate talking points. Exhibit A: Sarah Palin telling the National Rifle Association crowd about a (nonexistent) federal plan to make gun owners wear ""special bracelets that would identify you as a gun owner."" Exhibit B: MSNBC host Chris Hayes’ recent on-air shouting match with Larry Pratt, executive director of the lobbying group Gun Owners of America. Smart guns -- also known as ""child-proof guns"" and ""personalized guns"" -- are designed to work solely for authorized users through features like fingerprint recognition or electronic sensors. The hope is they will reduce deaths by suicide, accidental shootings or someone stealing a law enforcement officer’s weapon. They are not sold in the United States, though two dealers tried before backing down amid intense pressure from activists. Hayes supports the technology, but Pratt and other gun-rights advocates are skeptical. Pratt questions the guns’ reliability, saying smart guns are ""only 80 percent effective."" When Hayes pressed Pratt for the source of his statistic, Pratt cited the New Jersey Institute of Technology. ""Twenty percent of the time it won’t work,"" Pratt said. ""And you’re asking people to put their lives in the hands of a product like that?"" Later, Pratt used the figure again. ""Is it okay to put on the market a car that 20 percent of the time explodes on you and causes you harm or death?"" Since Pratt tripled down on his statistic, PunditFact wanted to check it out. Tracing the source of the claim Pratt pointed to a 2003 column in Popular Mechanics magazine headlined ""‘Smart’ Guns: Dumb Idea!"" The column was inspired by a 2002 New Jersey law that requires all guns sold in the state to have ""smart"" technology within three years of the attorney general verifying the first smart gun was sold in the United States. Fear among gun rights activists that more government mandates may come when this happens drive their opposition to smart guns. In his column 11 years ago, writer Cliff Gromer said law enforcement officers are exempt from the law, which proves the technology isn’t solid enough for the mainstream gun market. ""According to the New Jersey Institute of Technology, which used government grants to study personalized handgun technology, fingerprint recognition systems work only 80 percent of the time,"" Gromer wrote. ""But the New Jersey law goes into effect regardless of whether the guns are 100 percent -- or 80 percent -- reliable."" Article is not the smoking gun You may have read over it, but the 80 percent figure Gromer cited talks about fingerprint recognition systems. Not whether a smart gun will work. That’s important because while some smart guns use fingerprint recognition systems (which work like the new unlocking method for iPhones), not all do. The German-made Armatix iP1 .22 caliber pistol was expected to be the first smart gun sold in the United States this year until a California gun store owner scrapped plans to sell it after facing aggressive backlash. It happened again with a Maryland dealer. The Armatix does not have a fingerprint recognition system. Instead, the gun works with a black stopwatch and PIN code that emits radio signals to the gun to make it active. The signal is akin to what’s emitted from those bulky tags on mall merchandise that aren’t triggered until taken out of the store. Other models work with similar chips implanted in everyday accessories, such as bracelets, pins and rings, and some are implanted in the body. If the badge is too far away from the microchip in the gun, it will stop working. But that means the technology works, not that it failed. And, more critically, the Armatix radio signal has nothing to do with the study Pratt cited, which focused on fingerprint recognition systems, New Jersey Institute of Technology researchers told us. Other smart guns also avoid fingerprint technology. Michael Recce, an associate professor in the information systems department at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, invented ""dynamic grip recognition"" and applied it to a gun, so that it fires only after it recognizes the user’s grip thanks to sensors on the side of the gun that detect pressure and the contours of the user's hand. The gun starts to detect if the user is authorized as someone starts pulling the gun, he said. Recce said the owner detection rate for his dynamic grip ""is within the mechanical failure rate,"" i.e. the rate at which a standard gun fails. However, two or three people out of 100 adults could also fire the gun in trials because their hand is similar to the owner’s -- a tradeoff with the technology so it is sure to fire for the rightful owner, he said. Other types of smart guns in varying stages of development are outlined in a year-old National Institute of Justice report commissioned as part of President Barack Obama’s gun reforms after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings. This research is dated In this case, the New Jersey Institute of Technology research is being misapplied, and it’s old. Researchers told us their work on fingerprint scanners should not be applied to newer guns. Their research, which was not published, was done in the early 2000s on four types of guns using fingerprint readers. None of those guns were as reliable as mechanical firearms, they found, though the guns were a ""fragile technology"" then, said Donald Sebastian, New Jersey Institute of Technology senior vice president for research and development. ""Fingerprint readers may have progressed in the past 10 years,"" Recce said. ""At that time even the readers on laptops would often require you to swipe your finger more than once before they worked. Our opinion was that swiping your finger over the reader multiple times would be a challenge when using a gun."" Skeptics of these guns point to many concerns about the reliability of the weapons in a high-pressure situation, like who has time to enter a PIN code, and what if the sensors in the gun die? Michael Bazinet, a National Shooting Sports Foundation spokesman, said the ""strongest statement on their reliability"" will be when law enforcement officers use them en masse. But other potential weaknesses don’t change the fact that what Pratt cited is old news. ""To make a universal blanket statement based on a 15-year-old analysis of fingerprint detectors just doesn’t pass muster,"" Sebastian said. ""It’s like talking about the reliability of a Model T and comparing it to a race car. Apples and oranges."" If not 80 percent reliable, then what? Finding a reliability rate for smart guns is an ""almost unanswerable question,"" said Stephen Teret, a pro-smart gun Johns Hopkins professor and director of the university’s Center for Law and the Public’s Health. ""Because there’s a wide range of quality in existing guns, some are better, some are worse. So when you are trying to compute a rate of reliability, are you using one gun or various categories?"" Robert Spitzer, a SUNY Cortland political science professor and author of The Politics of Gun Control (whom Hayes brought in after Pratt to talk about the issue), said in order for the Armatix iP1 gun to be sold in California, it had to pass a reliability test. ""The standard was a 99 percent successful fire rate, which it met (fire 600 times with 6 or fewer failed discharges),"" Spitzer said. Others stressed that all guns are prone to failure at some point. The mechanical failure rate is often given as 1 in 1,000, and a military weapon’s failure rate is closer to 1 in 10,000, Sebastian said. ""Misfire is embedded in our language,"" he said. Our ruling Pratt said ""20 percent of the time (smart guns) won't work,"" which he got from a 2003 magazine story referencing unpublished research from the New Jersey Institute of Technology. The scientists who conducted that research say Pratt’s citation is misapplied. Researchers only looked at smart guns that rely on fingerprint sensors, yet Pratt applied the statistic to all smart guns, including the Armatix pistol that works with a black stopwatch, PIN code and small electronic chips. Even more, their research is more than a decade old, and they say fingerprint matching technology has changed since then. Pratt’s statement is not based on solid evidence",False,"May 20, 2014"
"Says he’s ""the only licensed firearms dealer in America running for Congress.""","It’s an attention-grabbing campaign ad. John Stone fires a cannon that he says resembles the one his forefathers used in the Revolutionary War. ""As the only licensed firearms dealer in America running for Congress, I’m willing to do the same if we have to,"" Stone declares on the video. ""But it's a whole lot easier just to vote in new House Republican leaders who will stand up to Obama and defend our Constitution."" Stone, a Republican and former congressional aide, is making his second bid to unseat five-term 12th District U.S. Rep. John Barrow, a Democrat from Augusta. He last tried in 2008. The Second Amendment is a galvanizing issue, and politicians know it. Barrow pulled out his father’s gun, his grandfather’s gun and his National Rifle Association endorsement for an ad when he was fending off other challengers two years ago. And it’s unlikely that many would say it was coincidence that this year, with the entire General Assembly up for re-election, state lawmakers passed a gun bill that the NRA called the ""most comprehensive"" in recent Georgia history and that critics decried as one of the nation’s most extreme. But can Stone really say he’s the only licensed firearms dealer in America running for Congress? We decided a fact check was in order. We saw the potential to check Stone’s claim. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives keeps a database of all federal firearms licenses, so a check of those names against the names of all U.S. House and Senate candidates could do the trick. The only problem: There are about 140,000 current federal firearms licenses, and many are issued in the names of businesses and corporations, not individuals. Stone was forthcoming with us about his license (he even emailed us a copy) and about how he came to make his only-one-in-the-country claim. Friends in the firearms industry pointed out to him in 2012 that he might be the only U.S. House candidate with an ATF license, Stone said. He said he went to multiple sources for verification, including the NRA, Gun Owners of America, the National Shooting Sports Foundation and the ATF. ""To everyone’s knowledge, I am the only one,"" Stone said. ""I have Google and Bing searched this extensively, and to the best of my knowledge and ability to check, I am the only one."" He volunteered that he would change his ad if another candidate were found to be able to make the same claim. But our research turned up another question: Can he really call himself a dealer? Stone has a federal firearms license. It is what’s known as a Curio and Relic license. He collects, restores and trades historic firearms, at least 50 years old, and as a hobby, not a business. When we asked the ATF to assist in our search for his license, we were told that, based on a code on the license, ""he’s a collector, not a dealer,"" a distinction we wondered about since his ad says dealer. The ATF does issue what it labels as ""dealer"" licenses. They are largely reserved for gunsmiths, pawnbrokers and others who make a living buying and selling many types of guns. Jerry Henry, with the gun advocacy group GeorgiaCarry.org, said he thinks Stone’s YouTube claim is ""misleading at best."" ""He’s a collector,"" Henry said. ""That’s not what I consider a firearms dealer."" Others we talked to agreed. Tim Coker with the National Firearms Dealer Network said gun enthusiasts hearing the claim would assume that Stone is a licensed dealer, selling modern firearms. NRA officials were not aware of Stone’s claim, spokesman Andrew Arulanandam said. The group has been a Barrow supporter. ""He (Barrow) has stood steadfast with gun owners, hunters and sportsmen thought his career,"" Arulanandam said. Stone remains insistent. He sent us two dictionary definitions of dealer. He also said he deals in black-powder firearms and pre-1899 firearms, which require no ATF license, restrictions or registration on buying and selling. ""I am a firearms dealer. I buy and sell firearms,"" he said. ""This fact is indisputable."" When we first started the fact check, we asked Stone why he decided to tout the fact that he was a federal firearms dealer. He said the discussion of where a candidate stands on Second Amendment rights can be time-consuming. With the dealer moniker as his calling card, he said his position is immediately clear. In summary, Stone, a former congressional aide, has proclaimed himself the ""only licensed firearms dealer in America running for Congress."" He said he wasn’t able to document that statement, but after talking with people in the firearms community, he believes it’s true. We couldn’t find any sources to definitively prove or disprove Stone’s claim of exclusivity. He does have a federal firearms license for a very niche group of collectors. He contends this status allows him to make the claim that he is a gun dealer. Others suggest his statement is misleading. Overall, a viewer of Stone’s ad needs much more information to weigh the value of his claim -- an awful lot of context is missing even though there is some truth to part of his statement",Half True,"May 14, 2014"
"Idaho Republican Rep. Mike Simpson is a ""liberal"" who voted with Nancy Pelosi to ""fund sex study programs of San Francisco prostitutes"" and ""to regulate the sale of firearms.""","We’ve seen plenty of Democrats called out for voting records that closely align with President Barack Obama and other party leaders. But it isn’t every day that a conservative super PAC claims that an eight-term Republican congressman is closely aligned with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. The Madison Action Fund is claiming just that, running an ad in Idaho linking GOP Rep. Mike Simpson to Pelosi, a frequent target of Republican ire. Here’s what the ad says: ""How liberal is congressman Mike Simpson? Simpson voted with Nancy Pelosi to bail out Wall Street. That wasnt enough spending for Mike Simpson, so he joined Pelosi in voting to take more of your money to fund sex study programs of San Francisco prostitutes. Simpson also joined Pelosi in voting to regulate the sale of firearms."" (We should note that what’s good for the goose is good for the gander: A group backing Simpson is also running ads tying his Republican primary opponent, Bryan Smith, to Pelosi. We checked that claim separately here). Simpson did in fact vote for the Wall Street bailout, as Pelosi did. But beyond that, the ad gets more dubious. Is Simpson a ""liberal""? Despite what the ad suggests, Simpson and Pelosi have very different voting records. In the current Congress, spanning 820 votes, Simpson and Pelosi have voted the same way just 29 percent of the time, according to OpenCongress.org, a website created by the pro-transparency Sunlight Foundation. Still, 29 percent isn’t nothing and some may say, if Simpson was a real conservative, he would vote with Pelosi 0 percent of the time. Maybe, but not every congressional vote is polarized, and even some of the most conservative members of Congress have voted with Pelosi at least on some issues. For instance, no one would confuse Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., for a liberal, yet Bachmann and Pelosi have voted the same way 24 percent of the time since January 2012. Simpson has voted with his party 95 percent of the time. Calling him a liberal and insinuating ideological coziness between him and Pelosi is simply inaccurate. Did Simpson and Pelosi both vote ""to fund sex study programs of San Francisco prostitutes""? This is an exaggeration. The Madison Action Fund’s ad cites a House vote from July 10, 2003. (You read that right — this happened 10 years ago.) On that day, the House of Representatives voted to pass an appropriations bill to fund the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, which included money for the National Institutes of Health. An amendment to the bill offered by then-Rep. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., sought to strip funding from five National Institutes of Health research grants. Toomey said one of those grants was a ""study on San Francisco's Asian prostitutes and masseuses."" Simpson voted against Toomey’s amendment. Pelosi (who represents San Francisco) did as well, and it narrowly failed. But Toomey’s description of the research grant might have warranted a ruling from the Truth-O-Meter were it around back then. The grant was awarded to the University of California San Francisco, the home of the AIDS Research Institute, and studied ways to reduce HIV risks among Asian women. Researchers pinpointed commercial sex workers at massage parlors as a key source of the large increase in HIV prevalence among Asian and Pacific islanders in the Bay area, for whom AIDS was the second-leading cause of death among those aged 25 to 44 in San Francisco in 2001. The researchers interviewed sex workers about their background, education, history of violence from customers, and sexual health, in order to develop programs to improve awareness of drug abuse and STD prevention among at-risk Asian-American popuations. Whether this research should have been selected for funding given the limited pool of money available is a reasonable question to debate, but saying it was to ""fund sex study programs of San Francisco prostitutes"" fails to factor in the public-health concerns at stake. Did Simpson and Pelosi vote together ""to regulate the sale of firearms""? This claim goes even further back. The Madison Action Fund singles out Simpson’s votes on the Mandatory Gun Show Background Check Act, a 1999 bill that emerged in the aftermath of the Columbine High School shooting. While on the surface the bill added some background check provisions for gun shows, the measure was more complicated. It included an amendment that actually eased restrictions on firearm purchases at gun shows. That measure, which had strong backing from the NRA and was harshly criticized by President Bill Clinton, passed the House with help from 45 Democrats. Simpson voted for it; Pelosi did not. Clinton called the vote ""a great victory for the NRA."" But it also included an amendment that was added to require safety locks to be sold with all handguns. The amendment had overwhelming bipartisan support, including from a majority of Republicans. Simpson voted for it, as did Pelosi, and it passed 311-115. The National Rifle Association ultimately urged Republicans to back the entire bill on final passage. Simpson followed the NRA’s lead and voted for the bill. Pelosi didn’t. And it failed 147-280. So ultimately, Simpson and Pelosi were mostly on opposite sides of the fight over this bill. Most importantly, when it came on votes to ""regulate the sale of firearms,"" Simpson voted to loosen restrictions while Pelosi wanted to maintain the status quo. They only voted on the same side on a measure to require safety locks on handguns. Our ruling The ad cherry picks a handful of votes to create the impression that Simpson and Pelosi are in ideological lockstep. But the votes chosen are old, cherry-picked and deeply misleading. Suggesting any substantial alliance between Simpson and Pelosi is ridiculous",False Pants on Fire,"May 7, 2014"
"Roughly 500,000 Georgians -- or about 5 percent of the state’s residents -- have gone through a background check to legally obtain a Georgia weapons carry license.","Gov. Nathan Deal recently signed legislation that has been applauded by Second Amendment purists and blasted by gun control advocates for expanding where Georgians with permits may legally carry firearms to include churches, schools and bars. ""This legislation will protect the constitutional rights of Georgians who have gone through a background check to legally obtain a Georgia weapons carry license. Roughly 500,000 Georgia citizens have a permit of this kind, which is approximately 5 percent of our population,"" Deal told reporters and bill supporters at a signing ceremony for House Bill 60. We wondered where the governor got his estimate and whether it’s correct. We decided to dig deeper. We first reached out to Brian Robinson, the governor’s spokesman, who pointed to lawmakers as the source of the information. ""It’s a rough estimate, which is how we couched it,"" Robinson said. ""The numbers are constantly in flux."" We then contacted state Rep. Rick Jasperse, R-Jasper, the bill’s major legislative champion, who broadened our understanding of the complexities of this fact check. ""We figure the number of licenses is about 750,000,"" Jasperse said in an email. The 500,000 figure is what is reported by Georgia’s 159 probate judges to the state Administrative Office of the Courts, Jasperse told us. But, he pointed out, that information has its shortcomings. Some probate judges fail to report the number of applicants consistently. Others don’t report them at all, he said. Georgians aren’t required to have a license, or permit, to keep a gun in their car, on their property or at their place of business with the business owner’s permission. With a permit, a person can carry a gun openly or concealed, except in restricted locations, such as a nuclear power plant or within 150 feet of a polling place. We found two counties that were identified as not reporting for 2012. We also confirmed that there is a state law on the books (O.C.G.A. § 15-5-24(3)) that requires each county’s probate court to report how many gun license applications it receives. We scratched our heads and asked: Has any probate court ever been punished for not complying with the law? Or is that even possible? ""No on both accounts"" was the response. Cobb County Probate Judge Kelli Wolk told us the judges only know how many people have applied for licenses, not how many have obtained them. ""It is a small distinction. But some folks are denied as ineligible. Some -- very few -- don’t get fingerprinted after applying. Some are revoked after issued. Some folks move to Cobb with licenses from other counties, etc.,""  Wolk said in an email. She provided us data that show gun applications in Cobb have risen from 3,426 in 2006 to 11,462 in 2013. From Jan. 1 to April 15 of this year, 3,690 applications were made in the county. (Permits are good for five years, unless revoked, Wolk said. The $79.25 fee that is charged is divided four ways between the Georgia Crime Information Center and Sheriff’s Office for the background check, the statewide vendor and the local probate court, she said.) We found that the 500,000-plus number that’s bandied about was derived by adding up five years worth of applications filed statewide with the probate courts. (Actual number of applications was 535,826 for 2008 through 2012, according to our calculations). This clearly has some shortcomings. But the rationale, we were told, was that figure could at least be in the park since gun permits are good for five years. In 2012, the federal Government Accounting Office found the number of states allowing concealed carry permits was increasing, and the eligibility requirements and reciprocity agreements differed broadly, depending on the state. Seven states and the District of Columbia, as of June 2002, prohibited the concealed carry of handguns. By March 2012, individuals could carry concealed handguns everywhere but Illinois and the District of Columbia, the agency found. According to state reporting to the GAO, there were at least 8 million active permits to carry concealed handguns in the U.S. as of Dec. 31, 2011. This included about 600,000 in Georgia, which, at the time, had an estimated 6.9 million people 20 years or older. ""That number (the 600,000 reported by the GAO) is pretty close to my ‘adjusted’ number, corrected for the missing probate court numbers,"" Jasperse said. Jerry Henry with the gun rights group GeorgiaCarry.org said he estimates about 750,000 Georgians are licensed gun carriers. But the reality is we couldn’t find anyone who has an actual permit count. And the new law, which takes effect July 1, prohibits anyone from keeping a database of permit holders. Dubbed by opponents as the ""guns everywhere bill,"" the law allows firearms in churches, bars and government buildings under certain circumstances. It prohibits law enforcement officials from asking someone with a gun whether he or she has a license. It gives school systems the ability to decide whether teachers or other staff should be armed. The new law also repeals state law requiring firearms dealers to obtain state licenses and maintain records of firearm sales and purchases, and it revokes the governor's authority to suspend or limit the carrying or sale of guns in case of emergencies. Since its signing, some religious leaders -- including Catholic Archbishop Wilton Gregory of Atlanta -- have declared that guns won’t be permitted in their churches. Summary: There’s no firm data on how many gun permits are out there. Deal made clear that the number he quoted was a rough estimate of gun permits in Georgia. It falls in line with the lowest of the estimates out there. Deal’s statement is accurate but needs a bit of additional context to be fully understood",Mostly True,"May 6, 2014"
"Says Attorney General Eric Holder recently revealed ""this idea to have government have gun owners wear special bracelets that would identify you as a gun owner.""","""Waterboarding is how we baptize terrorists"" was not the only questionable thing Sarah Palin said during her recent speech to National Rifle Association enthusiasts. In stirring up concerns about gun rights, the former Alaska governor and 2008 vice presidential nominee turned conservative rabble-rouser misrepresented comments from Attorney General Eric Holder about investments in smart-gun technology. ""Every day we are seeing more and more efforts to strip away our Second Amendment rights,"" Palin told the crowd. ""They are trying,"" she said, before leading into her claim about Holder. ""Recently, he reveals this idea to have government have gun owners wear bracelets, special bracelets, that would identify you as a gun owner,"" Palin said. ""Well, hey, Holder, you don't want to go there, buddy."" There is more to the story than Holder wanting gun owners to wear identifying bracelets. Holder’s comments on gun bracelets Holder uttered the words ""guns"" and ""bracelet"" before a House appropriations subcommittee on April 4, 2014, as he testified about his agency’s 2015 budget request. U.S. Rep. Andy Harris, R-Md., asked Holder about requested grants to ""encourage development of innovative gun safety technology."" Holder explained the grant request stems from a White House-driven meeting amid talk of gun regulation reforms. ""We talked about how guns can be made more safe by making them either through fingerprint identification, the gun talks to a bracelet or something that you might wear, how guns can be used only by the person who is lawfully in possession of the weapon. ""It’s those kinds of things that I think we want to try to explore so that we can make sure that people have the ability to enjoy their Second Amendment rights, while at the same time decreasing the misuse of weapons that lead to the kinds of things that we see on a daily basis, you know, where people, kids especially, are struck down by ..."" Harris cut him off, saying ""sure, no one wants that to occur,"" and moved on. Holder’s comment about new gun technology was picked up a few days later in an April 7 Washington Free Beacon story under the headline, ""Holder: We Want to Explore Gun Tracking Bracelets."" From there, it was picked up by Fox News, InfoWars, Townhall.com and the National Rifle Association, among others. In each case, the coverage focused on the idea of ""gun tracking bracelets."" But the technology doesn’t track gun owners, and it doesn’t always require a bracelet. Smart guns and the Department of Justice Holder had smart guns on his mind because of President Barack Obama and reforms he sought after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings. Obama directed Holder, via one of 23 executive orders, to release a report on gun safety technology ""and challenge the private sector to develop innovative technologies."" As he mentioned in his testimony, the department’s National Institute of Justice released a report in June 2013 assessing the marketplace, and Holder chaired a meeting with industry leaders and experts at the White House. Smart guns are also called ""owner-authorized guns,"" ""childproof guns"" and ""personalized guns."" Basically, these are firearms made with electronic chips and sensors that can discern an authorized user from an unauthorized user. The gun will fire if it recognizes the owner and won’t if the owner is not recognized. Some high-tech models include a fingerprint reader that works kind of like the one in new iPhones (or James Bond’s personalized gun in Skyfall). Other models include the capability to read a radio signal from a transmitter embedded into a bracelet, ring, watch or pin worn by the gun owner, or even a chip implanted in the hand. ""If that is within a certain programmed distance to the gun, the gun mechanically makes itself operable,"" said Stephen Teret, a smart-gun proponent, professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and director of the Center for Law and the Public’s Health. ""If it’s not within a certain distance, the gun won't work."" So the short signals emitted in smart-gun technology do not function like GPS on mobile phones and other devices. The lack of GPS technology would prevent the government from identifying and tracking gun owners, should the government try, said Mike Bazinet, spokesman for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, a firearm and ammunition trade group. Bazinet noted that doesn't mean the group isn't concerned about that prospect. The technology could require a bracelet. It could also require a watch, a ring, a pin, or even just a fingerprint, experts say. The point is there is no plan to identify gun owners with a ""scarlet letter"" bracelet. Origins and controversies Teret says the earliest smart gun was developed by Smith & Wesson in the 1880s. The manufacturer added a metal lever to the back of its handguns, requiring a person to press the the lever and the trigger at the same time to fire the weapon. A child’s hand would be too small to do that, thus preventing accidental injuries and deaths. Manufacturers started thinking about incorporating electronics into guns in the early 1990s to make them safer. The concept had support from the Bill Clinton administration, lost steam during the George W. Bush years, and then re-emerged after the Newtown, Conn., school shootings under Obama, Teret said. International companies, such as Armatix in Germany and TriggerSmart in Ireland, are ahead of the curve, thanks in part to less political resistance, Teret said. But there is technology emerging in the United States. Utah-based Kodiak Industries is offering the Intelligun, a fingerprint-locking system installed onto a 1911-style, .45 caliber pistol, for $399. This year, a California gun retailer told the Washington Post he planned to sell the Armatix iP1 .22 caliber pistol, an $1,800 product that works with a black stopwatch and PIN code that emits radio signals to the gun when worn by the right user. It was supposed to be the first smart gun sold in the United States, but the owner and Armatix representative received backlash from gun rights activists, and the plans were scrapped. Here’s what the iP1 looks like:  It’s not the development of smart guns that concerns the firearms industry, Bazinet said. It’s government’s embrace of them. A New Jersey law, the only one of its kind, requires after three years from the first smart gun being sold in the United States that all new guns sold in the state be built with this technology. To Bazinet, smart guns won’t be ready for mass use until police forces are using them. His group has warned about defective guns and dead batteries while saying consumers should be able to buy them if they want. Of course, none of this information changes the veracity of Palin’s comments about ID bracelets for gun owners. It just shows how wrong she was. Emails to Palin’s political action committee were not returned. Our ruling According to Palin, Holder recently revealed ""this idea to have government have gun owners wear bracelets, special bracelets, that would identify you as a gun owner."" That’s far from the truth. Holder said he wants the federal government to explore gun safety measures, including smart-gun technology that would prevent weapons from being fired by anyone except their rightful owner. The comment in question came as he explained why his agency is seeking federal money for grants to spur research into safer guns. He listed fingerprint identification and the gun talking ""to a bracelet or something that you might wear"" as tools that could prevent a gun owner’s firearm from being used by someone else. Some smart guns are powered by bracelets with embedded radio signal transmitters, but that’s just one way this could work. The purpose of accessories worn in order to fire a smart gun is not to help the government track owners or identify them (again, Holder is pursuing no such policy). The goal of the emerging technology is to minimize shootings caused by suicides, children or stolen guns",False,"May 1, 2014"
"""No other country has a constitutional right"" like the Second Amendment.","Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., went all in for gun owners in a speech to the NRA as the potential presidential candidate sought to squelch any doubts about his commitment to gun rights. Rubio was one of a few 2016 Republican presidential hopefuls who spoke at the NRA’s annual convention in Indianapolis on April 25. He described the right to own a gun as part of the American Dream, highlighted the ""futility"" of existing gun laws and chastised the media for stigmatizing gun owners. At one point, Rubio described the Constitution of the United States as unique. ""I'm always amused that those who come up to me and say no other country has a constitutional right like this,"" he said. ""As if to imply that there is something wrong with us. But we say no other country has a constitutional right like this not with scorn, but with pride."" Wayne LaPierre, the NRA’s executive vice president and CEO, made a similar statement during his own speech to the annual meeting, saying, ""Our Second Amendment freedom separates us from every other country on earth."" Is it correct that the United States is the only country that gives residents a constitutional right to bear arms? The Second Amendment The Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution states: ""A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."" We asked several legal experts if the United States is the only such country that has a constitutional right to bear arms. Tom Ginsburg, University of Chicago international law professor and co-director of the Comparative Constitutions Project, has studied gun rights in national constitutions dating back to 1789. Only a minority of constitutions have ever included gun rights, and the number has dwindled, Ginsburg concluded in a 2013 article he wrote with Zachary Elkins, a University of Texas government professor. But Ginsburg added in an interview with PolitiFact that ""the precise language in each constitution is different, and no other country has the ‘well-regulated militia’ language."" Of the constitutions that do have an explicit right to bear arms ""ours is the only one that does not explicitly include a restrictive condition,"" wrote Elkins in a New York Times op-ed. The Constitutions Project zeroed in on two countries: ""We code only Mexico, Guatemala and the U.S. as having a right to bear arms,"" Ginsburg told PolitiFact. While the constitutions of Haiti and Iran do mention guns, ""the provision was too ambiguous for us to consider it a true right to bear arms."" Here is how the Comparative Constitutions Project translates the right to own arms in Guatemala and Mexico: • Guatemala Article 38: ""The right to own (‘tenencia’) weapons for personal use, not prohibited by the law, in the place of inhabitation, is recognized. There will not be an obligation to hand them over, except in cases ordered by a competent judge."" • Mexico Article 10: ""The inhabitants of the United Mexican States have the right to possess arms in their residences for their protection and legitimate defense, except such as are expressly forbidden by law or which have been reserved for the exclusive use of the Army, Navy, Air Force and National Guard. Federal law will determine the circumstances, conditions, requirements, and places in which the bearing of arms by inhabitants will be authorized."" The authors of the article concluded that ""the U.S. Constitution is alone in omitting any written conditions under which the government can regulate arms and munitions. In other countries, the right is typically limited to self-defense, either of the home or the state itself."" Guatemala, they note, ""gives its citizens the right to own weapons for personal use in the home and states that citizens can only be forced to relinquish guns by judicial order. Haiti gives citizens the right to use guns to defend the home but explicitly denies a general right to bear arms."" They added that in the United States, the judicial branch has ruled that some restrictions on gun ownership are permissible -- they just aren’t outlined in the Constitution itself. ""U.S. courts have allowed some exceptions to unconditional gun ownership in the form of local, state and federal statutes restricting ownership or possession of firearms,"" the authors wrote. ""In this way, the courts have served to render constitutional law somewhat less exceptional than the text itself would suggest."" Other legal experts we consulted agreed that Mexican and Guatemalan constitutions come closest to the United States’, at least up to a point. ""If the question is an express right to arms in the nation’s Constitution, there's also Mexico, Haiti, and Guatemala,"" said David Kopel, research director at the Independence Institute and adjunct professor of Advanced Constitutional Law at Denver University. ""The Mexican and Haitian governments essentially ignore the right, and get away with doing so. For example, there is only one gun store allowed in the entire nation of Mexico."" (There is a long list of criteria to buy a gun at this sole legal outlet, according to the Washington Post.) The NRA didn’t respond directly to our fact-check, but Kopel told PolitiFact that he frequently writes for the NRA’s magazine. One law professor also suggested we look at Switzerland. PolitiFact explained in a fact-check in 2013 that the Swiss government requires nearly every able-bodied young male adult to serve in the citizen militia, where they are issued a military rifle. The guns are supposed to be for military use only, not for personal defense. Anyone who wants to keep the weapon after their years of service can do so if they can provide an acceptable reason; the gun is then refitted to limit its firepower. Switzerland does not have a constitutional right to keep and bear arms, Kopel said. Rubio’s response We sent Rubio’s spokesman a 2010 article in Slate that stated Mexico, Haiti and Guatemala have the right to bear arms in their Constitutions though it stated that Guatemala was the only one as broad as our Second Amendment. Spokesman Alex Conant said the language in the Guatemalan Constitution isn’t as strong as the language in the U.S. Second Amendment, which includes ""the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed."" Conant also suggested we take a look at the characterization of Guatemala’s gun laws on www.gunpolicy.org, a website hosted by the Sydney School of Public Health that supports global efforts to prevent gun injury. The website calls Guatemala’s gun laws ""restrictive"" while it labeled our gun laws ""permissive."" ""All you seem to have established is that one country has some language similar to ours, but in practice does not treat the right in the same way,"" Conant said. Our ruling Rubio said during a speech to the NRA that ""no other country has a constitutional right"" like the Second Amendment. Mexico and Guatemala have the right to bear arms in their constitutions. However, the Second Amendment is unique because it is the only one that doesn’t include restrictive conditions within the constitutional language",Mostly True,"April 29, 2014"
"Because the EPA closed a lead smelter in Missouri, ""all lead for bullets will have to come from overseas!""","""We, the American public have been blindsided again by the Obama crowd!!!"" warns a chain email. ""Last Lead smelting plant -- gone."" The email goes on to blame the ""Evil Protection Agency"" for shutting down a lead smelting plant, calling it ""backdoor gun control"" and saying it will result in the cost of bullets soaring. ""All lead for bullets will have to come from overseas!"" the email says, adding, ""Long term what this means: Your investment in ammo may be your best investment. Guns will be plentiful but ammo will be another story. How does $3.75 a round (that's for one bullet) for a 9mm work for you?  Box of 50 would only cost you $187.50."" We wondered: Is the email correct to say that all lead for bullets will now have to come from overseas? The Doe Run plant We’ve been down this road before. In December, former Republican U.S. Rep. Allen West of South Florida, stated on his website: ""It seems that back door gun control is in full effect in the United States. Why? Thanks to Obama’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), we can no longer smelt lead from ore in the United States. ... So America, back door gun control is moving forward and while we are all distracted with Obamacare and Iran nuclear negotiations, our Second Amendment rights are undergoing an assault by clandestine infiltration."" We rated West’s claim Pants on Fire. The shuttered smelter, operated by Doe Run, is located in Herculaneum, Mo. Facing regulatory concerns about its air-quality record, Doe Run announced in 2010 that it had reached a settlement with the EPA and the state of Missouri which included paying fines. Then, in December 2013, it shut down. We found no evidence that the EPA’s settlement had anything to do with gun control -- it was about pollution. Ever since the EPA was created in 1970, one of its missions has been to limit pollution from smelters, which are ""terribly toxic sites,"" said David Rosner, a professor of sociomedical sciences at Columbia University who studies the politics of pollution, told us when we wrote fact-checked West. Lead can accumulate in the body from many sources, and it can severely hamper mental and physical development. ""It had nothing to do with gun control or bullets,"" Rosner told PolitiFact. ""The idea of linking this to an issue of gun control or a surreptitious way for the government trying to shut down the gun industry is nuts. This was an EPA decision because of children who were being poisoned by what had come out of that plant."" Indeed, while the chain email blames Obama, the EPA’s case against Doe Run actually began decades ago. The St. Louis area failed to meet federal clean air standards for lead in 1987 due to emissions from the smelter, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported in 1989. That was during the Reagan administration. Reagan wasn't the only Republican president who presided over an advance in the national anti-lead effort. In 2008, during the tenure of President George W. Bush, the EPA adopted tougher air quality standards for lead that were 10 times more stringent than the past. Doe Run’s primary smelter -- a plant that extracts lead from ore -- was the last primary smelter in the country. But Doe Run continues to operate as a secondary lead smelter -- essentially a recycler for lead contained in other products. That includes -- you guessed it -- bullets. A company spokeswoman told us in December that more than 80 percent of all lead produced in the United States is used in either vehicle batteries or in stationary batteries for backup power used by the military and in telecommunications and medical applications. ""In the U.S., the recycle rate of these batteries is approximately 98 percent, making lead-based batteries the most highly recycled consumer product,"" the company said in a statement. ""These batteries are recycled at secondary lead smelters. We own such a smelter in southern Missouri."" In our previous fact check, Doe Run spokeswoman Tammy Stankey told us that the company ""will continue to supply our ammo customers using secondary lead."" We contacted Stankey again for this fact-check. ""The primary smelter did close, (but) we are still supplying ammo customers through our only secondary smelter,"" she told us. ""We do know that primary lead is being imported to the U.S., but we don’t know if it is specific to ammunition suppliers. ... There are many other uses of lead."" Ammunition experts Now that the Doe Run primary smelter has been shuttered for a few months, we checked back with ammunition experts to see whether there’s any evidence that all lead for bullets now comes from overseas. An NRA spokesman referred us to the National Shooting Sports Foundation. Spokesman Mike Bazinet told us for this fact-check that ""almost all the lead used in ammunition in the U.S. comes from secondary sources, recycled car batteries and other sources of lead. The closing of the lead smelter has not had any effect on ammunition prices or availability. ... Lead for bullets comes from secondary sources, and that was not completely understood by people out there. We certainly tried explain that it's had virtually no effect on ammunition prices."" While some ammunition is imported to the U.S. from overseas, ""it would be pretty heavy stuff to send (lead) across the ocean and put into a bullet. There are secondary sources of lead in sufficient quantity in the United States."" Tom Falone -- president of Clearwater-based Florida Bullet, which supplies ammunition to law-enforcement agencies in Florida -- said its manufacturer has been using reclaimed lead for years. ""I think that by the time we see a shortage, the industry will have found another material to replace the lead with,"" Falone said. Our ruling A chain email said that following closure of a lead smelter in Missouri, ""all lead for bullets will have to come from overseas!"" While the closure of a Doe Run primary lead smelter in December 2013 means there are no smelters to make lead from ore anywhere in the United States, smelters to recycle lead remain in operation, and their output is substantial enough to satisfy the needs of ammunition manufacturers. Four months after that particular smelter closed, we found no evidence that all lead for bullets now comes from overseas",False Pants on Fire,"April 25, 2014"
"""Democrats very much are in the pocket of the NRA.""","When billionaire Michael Bloomberg stepped down as mayor of New York City, the big question was what would he do next? This week, Bloomberg gave part of the answer. He unveiled a $50 million fund to advance the cause of gun control, an issue that has long been close to his heart. Even in a political ecosystem flooded with cash, this was more than enough to get peoples’ attention. On MSNBC, Washington Post reporter Nia-Malika Henderson figured that the money might have some impact if Bloomberg spent strategically in certain states and cities. As for change at the federal level, Henderson that gave long odds. ""I think the NRA (National Rifle Association) is a formidable force,"" Henderson said. ""It’s a formidable force because Democrats very much are in the pocket of the NRA and they didn’t want to vote against the NRA."" We are checking whether Democrats are ""in the pocket of the NRA."" We emailed and tweeted Henderson to learn what information led her to that conclusion. We did not hear back. In Henderson’s absence, we find two ways to assess her statement - quantitatively through the lens of campaign dollars, and qualitatively through the lens of Democrats’ actions. Jeffrey Berry is a political scientist at Tufts University who has studied the role of special interest groups in Washington. Berry called Henderson’s words ""a gross mischaracterization."" ""Most leaders of the Democratic Party do not support the goals of the NRA and are not ‘in the pocket’ of the organization,"" Berry said. ""Many Democratic leaders are avowed supporters of gun control, including the president of the United States. There's a reason why the NRA is so hostile toward the Democratic Party."" Campaign contribution numbers show the NRA’s clear preference for Republicans over Democrats. According the Center for Responsive Politics, nearly 90 percent of the NRA’s donations went to Republican candidates or parties in the 2012 elections. The NRA gave more than $1.1 million. Even Henderson’s own paper, the Washington Post, reported on some of these numbers. Here’s what that looks like:                    In the current election cycle, the trend is even more lopsided. So far, the NRA has given about 96 percent of its contributions to Republicans, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. But if we look at how the gun control issue has played out in Congress, especially in the Senate, we see some Democrats exercising great caution where the NRA is concerned. In last year’s vote on requiring background checks for all commercial gun sales, the proposal failed in part because four key Democrats opposed it. The list included Sens. Mark Begich of Alaska, Mark Pryor of Arkansas, Max Baucus of Montana and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota. All represented rural states where gun rights are popular. Baucus decided not to run for re-election and both Begich and Pryor face tough races. The Democratic control of the Senate likely hinges on how Democrats fare in close elections, and their appetite for taking on the NRA is limited.   Rutgers University political scientist Beth Leech said the relationship between Democrats and the NRA is not one of partnership, but dread. If some Democrats are afraid to take on the NRA, it’s not because of campaign cash supporting them. It’s because of the NRA money that might be used to try and defeat them. ""The NRA spent $11 million in 2012 on outside expenditures,"" Leech said. ""Many Democrats may be afraid of seeing that outside spending power used against them in an election."" Our ruling Henderson said Democrats are in the pocket of the NRA. Henderson did not send us any information to support or clarify her statement. In terms of campaign contributions, the NRA sends its money almost entirely to Republicans. In the sense that ""in the pocket"" means a cozy comfortable relationship, the political scientists we reached said Henderson’s claim was wrong. On the other hand, the record shows that on key votes, some Democrats will avoid raising the ire of the NRA. The relationship is hardly cozy but the result is the same. Henderson’s words don’t capture this factor well, but due to it, enough Democrats end up doing what the NRA wants",Mostly False,"April 17, 2014"
"""By a two-to-one margin, Rhode Islanders want to ban assault weapons and we have a very small percentage of gun owners in this state, less than 13 percent.""","During debate on any contentious issue, advocates will argue that the public is on their side. That was the case during a March 18, 2014, State House rally designed to encourage the Rhode Island General Assembly to adopt stronger gun-control laws. Rep. Linda Finn, D-Middletown, used that strategy at the end of her speech. ""By a two-to-one margin, Rhode Islanders want to ban assault weapons and we have a very small percentage of gun owners in this state, less than 13 percent,"" she said. We decided to see whether support for an assault weapons ban is really that high and the level of gun ownership in Rhode Island is really that low. PolitiFact has looked at the issue nationally, giving a Mostly True to Sen. Dianne Feinstein's 2013 comment that ""No poll done this year . . . shows less than a majority to reinstate a federal ban on assault weapons."" But Finn is claiming a much larger margin of support. When we contacted Finn, she sent us the results of a poll released in February 2013 in which 64 percent of Rhode Islanders said they supported banning assault weapons, 27 percent were opposed and 9 percent were not sure. Even with a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percent, that's a 2-to-1 margin. The 24-question survey of 614 voters covered a wide range of issues and was done by Public Policy Polling, a Democratic-leaning survey firm based in North Carolina. Unlike most other polling services, PPP collects its data through robocalls, in which people hear a recorded message and are asked to respond by pressing a button on their telephone. That means a lot of people -- typically 9 out of 10 -- hang up without responding. After checking with area pollsters, we couldn't find a more traditional survey of Rhode Islanders on the assault weapons issue. Finn said she thought the PPP results were similar to the results of national polls. They're not. We found a compilation of assault weapons polls at PollingReport.com and discovered that the degree of support for a ban on assault-style weapons was much less pronounced. The split was 54-42 in a May 2013 Pew study, 56-42 in an April 2013 ABC News / Washington Post survey, 51-48 in an April 2013 CNN / ORC poll, and 59-36 in a March 2013 Quinnipiac University survey. Those national results don't come close to the 2-to-1 margin of support seen in the PPP Rhode Island poll, but that shouldn't be surprising when other parts of the United States have very different attitudes toward firearms. And what about Finn's statement about the rate of gun ownership in Rhode Island? A direct state-by-state tally of gun owners is not available. In fact, it is illegal in Rhode Island for the state to maintain a gun registry. We do know that in 2013, 3,280 active concealed carry permits were issued by the Rhode Island attorney general's office. But that's only a small fraction of owners. Also last year, Rhode Island gun dealers reported doing 21,793 BCI background checks for the purchase or transfer of at least one firearm. All but 145 were approved. But that number doesn't tell you how many gun owners there are in Rhode Island because that's only for one year, each purchase might involve more than one weapon, and the same owner might be counted multiple times if he or she makes more than one purchase throughout the year. So the best information comes from surveys. Finn sent us to a webpage at About.com which reports that 12.8 percent of Rhode Island's population owns guns, and the only states where gun ownership was lower were Massachusetts, New Jersey and Hawaii. About.com says the source is the website USACarry.com. But it’s actually from a from a survey done six years earlier -- in 2001 -- by the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, which tracks health risks in the United States and is billed as ""the world’s largest telephone survey."" In addition, that wasn't the percentage of the population owning guns. It was the percentage of adults who said there was at least one weapon in their household. We were unable to get more recent data from the BRFSS, which asked the question in 2002 and 2004. But we found it in two studies. A 2005 paper in the journal Pediatrics reported that the 2002 rate in Rhode Island was 13.3 percent, slightly higher than what Finn reported. A 2013 paper in the American Journal of Epidemiology looked at the data from 2004, reporting a rounded-off rate of 12 percent, which conforms with what Finn said. Our ruling Rep. Linda Finn said, ""By a two-to-one margin, Rhode Islanders want to ban assault weapons and we have a very small percentage of gun owners in this state, less than 13 percent."" Finn's statement about how Rhode Islanders feel about the issue comes from a recent robocall poll that has not been confirmed by any other Rhode Island polls. Her statement on the rate of gun ownership in Rhode Island is based on very outdated studies. But we have not been able to find any more recent data to suggest the number has changed",Mostly True,"April 6, 2014"
"Says President Barack Obama told a room of students, ""Children, every time I clap my hands together, a child in America dies from gun violence,"" and then a child told him he could solve the problem by not clapping any more.","A reader recently sent us a chain email that seemed hard to believe. Accompanied by a photograph of President Barack Obama conversing with a classroom of students, the chain email included the following text: ""Barack Obama, at a recent rural elementary school assembly in South Carolina, asked the audience for total quiet. Then, in the silence, he started to slowly clap his hands once every few seconds, holding the audience in total silence. Then he said into the microphone, 'Children, every time I clap my hands together, a child in America dies from gun violence.' Then, little Darrell, with a proud South Carolina drawl, pierced the quiet and said, ‘Well, dumb a--, stop clappin’!’"" The reader wanted to know: Did this really happen? We didn’t hear back from the White House, but we couldn’t find any instance of such an exchange in transcripts listed on the White House website or in the Nexis news database. A Google search turned up many variations of this claim repeated in the conservative blogosphere, but none from an independent news source. Snopes.com, the website that looks into urban legends, has also seen this chain email. Back in 2008, when Obama wasn’t even president yet, an email circulated that was essentially the same, but which involved a ""little feller in East Texas"" named Richard Earl. Even earlier, in September 2007, Snopes found one aimed at Hillary Clinton, who was then running against Obama in the Democratic presidential primary. This time, the episode supposedly took place in North Florida, with an unnamed ""young voice with a proud southern accent"" saying, ""Well, just stop clappin’, ya evil b----!"" It’s possible that this joke is very old indeed, but Snopes tracked the inspiration for it at least as far back as a 2005 video released by the group ""Make Poverty History."" The video, titled ""Click,"" shows a variety of celebrities -- including Bono of U2, Brad Pitt and George Clooney -- snapping their fingers every three seconds. The narrator, Liam Neeson, explains that a child dies unnecessarily due to extreme poverty every three seconds. By the next year, 2006, Snopes documented an email similar to the Obama email, this one with Bono the target. In this version, it’s a voice with a ""thick Scottish brogue"" that tells Bono, ""Well stop ----ing doing it then!!"" This makes it clear that the episode is a joke rather than an actual event involving Obama. Our ruling A chain email said President Obama told a room of students, ""Children, every time I clap my hands together, a child in America dies from gun violence."" A child then purportedly told Obama he could solve the problem by not clapping anymore. We failed to find any evidence that this happened to Obama, and the existence of earlier emails making fun of Hillary Clinton and Bono make clear that this is a joke being passed off falsely as a real anecdote",False Pants on Fire,"March 17, 2014"
"Even though Chicago has ""the most stringent gun laws on the books,"" it still ""has the highest murder rate"" in the country.","Citing the number of school shootings since Sandy Hook, a woman asked U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson at one of his town hall meetings why he doesn’t support expanded background checks for gun purchases. The Wisconsin Republican responded by connecting strict gun control with a high rate of homicide. ""I’ll repeat it: I think we have enough gun laws on the books; we should enforce those,"" Johnson told his audience in Appleton on Feb. 18, 2014. ""But, if you really take a look -- again, look at the facts. The most stringent gun laws on the books are in places like Chicago, (which) has the highest murder rate. ""I mean, you see a lot of these -- and let’s face it, they’re all tragedies. I wish there was some magic solution to end those tragedies, prevent them, but there’s not. Some of these tragedies occurred with firearms that were legally obtained. We’ve got, what, 300 million guns on the streets? These tragedies occur in gun-free zones. So, law-abiding citizens abide by those laws; the criminals don’t."" Is Johnson right that Chicago has some of the nation’s strictest gun laws, as well as the highest murder rate? And that the two are tied together? We’ll check both parts of his claim. Chicago gun laws, murders Two days after the town hall meeting, we asked Johnson spokesman Patrick McIlheran for evidence to support the senator’s claim. The next day, a blog post titled, ""If stricter gun laws were a magic wand, Chicago would be safe,"" appeared on Johnson’s official Senate web page. McIlheran referred us to the post and said he didn’t have time to discuss Johnson’s claim. In the post, Johnson cited reports from 2013 by National Public Radio and The New York Times in saying that Chicago has some of the nation’s strictest anti-gun laws. Several experts told us there is wide consensus on that point. But Johnson changed the part of his claim about murder in Chicago. Chicago doesn’t have the highest murder rate among U.S. cities -- as in, the number of murders per 100,000 residents -- but rather the highest number of murders, Johnson wrote. The blog cited the latest full-year FBI figures, for 2012. Chicago ranked first among cities in raw numbers, with 500 murders. But its 18.5 murders per 100,000 people didn’t even put the Windy City among the top 10 cities for murder rate. Those figures are for all murders. We also found a January 2013 report by economist Richard Florida that said Chicago had a rate of 11.6 gun murders per 100,000 residents, far below the city with the highest rate, New Orleans, at 62.1. So, on the first part of Johnson’s claim, Chicago has some of the most stringent gun-control laws in the United States, but does not have the highest murder rate. Connecting gun laws, murder rates By citing Chicago in his remarks at the town hall meeting, Johnson’s message was that strict gun-control laws are not associated with low murder rates. In his blog post, Johnson wrote that Chicago has a much higher murder rate than Racine and Kenosha -- much smaller cities in Wisconsin, which the senator said has ""more reasonable gun laws."" But we found that, on any connection between gun control and murder, the evidence is mixed. For example, had Johnson singled out another heavy-gun-control city -- New York -- in questioning the effectiveness of strict gun control, his audience at the town hall meeting would have gotten an entirely different impression. In 2012, New York’s overall murder rate was 3.8 per 100,000 residents -- far below Chicago’s 18.5. Similarly, the Richard Florida study we noted found that New York's gun murder rate was 4 per 100,000 people and Chicago’s was 11.6 per 100,000. Other views Experts we consulted agreed there is no consensus on whether there is a clear correlation -- much less evidence of cause and effect -- between gun-control laws and a lower murder rate. They said that is particularly true in assessing the relatively few city-level gun control laws, given that most gun laws are put in place at the state and federal level. For one thing, even if a city has strict laws on who can own guns, that doesn't mean it is difficult to bring guns into that city, said Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research. He said one study found that one-third of the guns recovered by police from criminals and crime scenes in Chicago had been purchased in Wisconsin, Indiana, Ohio or Mississippi -- states that, according to Webster, have the weakest gun laws. ""Not surprisingly, it turns out this is a pretty complex thing to study,"" he said. Webster said that while it is difficult to compare cities, given their differences in demographics and other factors, it is possible to examine how a change in gun restrictions is correlated with gun crime. A study of his released in February 2014, cited by the Think Progress liberal blog, looked at what happened after Missouri in 2007 repealed a law that had required gun buyers in private gun transactions to undergo background checks. It found the repeal ""was associated with"" an additional 55 to 63 murders per year  between 2008 and 2012. At the same time, there have been studies that found the opposite -- a link between fewer gun restrictions and lower murder rates. The findings of a November 2013 study by Quinnipiac University economics professor Mark Gius, which examined data from 1980 through 2009 and was cited by the National Rifle Association, ""suggest"" that states with restrictions on the carrying of concealed weapons had higher gun-related murder rates. The results, the study added, ""suggest that restrictive concealed weapons laws may cause an increase in gun-related murders at the state level."" Guis told us that assessing gun laws and crime is difficult because so many factors, including poverty and drugs, affect crime rates. Moreover, gun murders committed in the heat of passion or in mass shootings are often carried out by people with no criminal record, many of whom would pass a gun background check, he said. ""You really can't draw any direct correlation, definitely no cause and effect,"" Guis said, ""especially with city level gun-control laws -- to crime."" Our rating Johnson said that even though Chicago has ""the most stringent guns laws on the books,"" it still ""has the highest murder rate"" in the country. Chicago does have some of the strictest gun-control laws, but is not number one among U.S. cities for the murder rate. Meanwhile, the evidence is mixed on whether stricter gun control is associated with fewer murders",Half True,"March 2, 2014"
"Gun ""marketplaces"" on Facebook mean ""ANYONE can broker a deal on a gun online, meet the seller in a parking lot somewhere, and walk away with a weapon.""","In the wake of the 2012 shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School, gun-control advocates have redoubled efforts to pass laws focusing on universal background checks, clip capacity and assault rifles. Gun-rights groups have fought back, arguing that background checks won’t stop felons from getting weapons and that Second Amendment protections trump the need for new regulations. The Claim A national group with an Oregon chapter, Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, has launched a campaign aimed at persuading Facebook to ban online gun ""marketplaces."" Gun sales through these marketplaces are carried out legally without background checks, according to the group. And the downside is already apparent, they said, pointing to a convicted felon who was arrested in Iowa last week for acquiring a gun using a Facebook post. They added this: ""This means that ANYONE can broker a deal on a gun online, meet the seller in a parking lot somewhere, and walk away with a weapon."" Anyone? In a parking lot? PolitiFact Oregon checked. The Analysis We followed links to the 16 Oregon Facebook gun marketplaces listed in the group’s news release. The pages all have different administrators but share some features. They allow those who have joined that group to advertise guns, rifles, ammunition and gun parts. People can also include posts seeking to buy. Telephone numbers are often provided, and actual transactions are handled privately. We called Dennis Cannon, a Prineville resident who is an administrator of a central Oregon Facebook gun page, and asked whether background checks are part of typical sales. ""It’s up to each individual to do a background check on the person they are selling to,"" Cannon said. ""You can do that free through the sheriff’s office and run whoever you want."" Asked whether the sites are appropriate, he said, ""We have the right to bear arms. Felons don’t. I see nothing wrong with the sites. That’s why we live in a free country."" Next we called Kevin Starrett, executive director of the pro-gun Oregon Firearms Federation. He hadn’t heard of the Facebook sites but didn’t see anything surprising. ""At my gun club, people put up notes with pictures when they want to sell a gun,"" he said. ""This is no different than it’s ever been."" He acknowledged that the explosion of social media sites such as Facebook makes it possible for many more people to gain access to gun-sale information, but added, ""As far as any transactions are concerned, all of the same rules still apply."" So can anyone go to one of the Facebook marketplaces, cut a deal and buy a gun? We wanted to know what legal gun transactions -- whether initiated on Facebook or anywhere else -- require. We called Patricia Whitfield, Oregon State Police criminal justice systems director. She pointed us to ORS 166.436, which addresses firearm transfers by people other than gun dealers. Private-party sales, it states, do not require background checks. Not seeking a check, however, could cause a seller to run afoul of a companion statute, ORS 166.470, which applies to a seller who ""knows or reasonably should know"" that the recipient is a minor, has been convicted of a felony or ""has any outstanding felony warrants for arrest."" So laws pertaining to gun sales originating on Facebook pages are the same as those that apply to any private sale. (Oregon Sen. Floyd Prozanski, D-Eugene, hopes to get a bill requiring background checks for private-party guns sales through this session of the Legislature. The bill is still alive, though with the session ebbing, chances of it passing this time around don’t look promising.) A Facebook representative who would not give his name passed along links addressing company policies on guns. Advertising that ""promotes the sale or use of weapons"" won’t be accepted, according to the policies, but the marketplace pages themselves haven’t been deemed improper. He confirmed that Facebook is ""in conversations"" with Moms Demand Action, but declined to say what, if any, effect the group’s pressure might have. Sarah Finger McDonald, leader of the Oregon chapter of Moms Demand Action, defended her group’s petition drive to change Facebook’s policy. ""These sites completely open the door to countless unregulated gun sales,"" she said. The Ruling Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America has launched a campaign aimed at persuading Facebook to prohibit online gun ""marketplaces."" The group, providing a link to a news account, said at least one felon has obtained a weapon through a Facebook post. The group asserts that such sites enable ""ANYONE"" to ""broker a deal on a gun online, meet the seller in a parking lot somewhere, and walk away with a weapon."" Transactions initiated on Facebook are no different from any other private-party gun sale in Oregon. While current laws don’t require background checks for private sales, it is still the legal responsibility of sellers not to peddle guns to felons and minors. Yet with at least 16 Facebook gun marketplaces now operating in Oregon, far more people than ever have access to an array of guns and rifles. And with the exception of felons and minors, ""anyone"" can seek out a Facebook gun page, broker a deal online and arrange a private transfer. The group’s statement is true but needs clarification to make clear that the same rules -- or lack thereof -- apply to Facebook transactions as to all other private-party gun sales. Though Facebook pages can advertise guns for sale to a broader audience, there’s nothing inherent about them that makes the actual purchase easier or harder. ""ANYONE"" is also sweeping. Clearly, Oregon laws -- though they’re sometimes violated -- set some limits on who can buy a gun",Mostly True,"February 27, 2014"
"""I've been a cop in Lake County, Michigan, since 1982 thereabout. I conduct federal raids with the DEA and ATF and U.S. Marshals and the FBI and Texas Rangers.""","Until last week, Ted Nugent was best known as a rock musician, a bow hunter, and an ardent supporter of gun rights. But his recent description of President Barack Obama as a ""subhuman mongrel"" eclipsed all of that, especially at a time when he has campaigned on behalf of a Texas Republican candidate for governor. Those words are rooted in Nazi anti-Semitic propaganda and the writings of white supremacists. The uproar drew a terse apology from the singer of hits such as ""Cat Scratch Fever."" But in an interview with CNN’s Erin Burnett, he insisted that he had not drawn on the rhetoric of racist literature. At least for the word ""mongrel,"" Nugent said the word was used in his time in law enforcement. ""I've been a cop in Lake County, Michigan, since 1982 thereabout. I conduct federal raids with the DEA and ATF and U.S. Marshals and the FBI and Texas Rangers and heroes of law enforcement. ""And we are re-arresting fugitive felons let out of their cages after murdering and raping and molesting children, carjacking. And we keep going after these guys. ""The adrenaline is something like you will never experience, I hope you never have to experience it, but when we are done with these kinds of raids, we get together and our hearts are broken that we have to face these monsters. We call them mongrels. We call bad people who are destroying our neighborhoods mongrels."" Is Nugent a cop? Does he ""conduct federal raids with the DEA and ATF and U.S. Marshals and the FBI and Texas Rangers?"" We wanted to know. 'I've been a cop in Lake County, Michigan, since 1982 thereabout' Lake County, Mich., is located about 90 miles north of Grand Rapids. It has about 11,500 residents and describes itself as ""an outdoor recreation paradise."" Nugent is a reservist for the county sheriff's office, Sheriff Robert Hilts told us. But, ""He’s never joined us for any raids. Fortunately, we don’t have those sorts of problems up here."" Hilts said Nugent has no authority or official responsibilities. The only activity involving Nugent that Hilts could recall was raising money on behalf of the department and for a local boy who has cystic fibrosis. ""We’re always searching the woods for a hunter that’s lost or hurt,"" Hilts said. ""He helped us buy a four-wheel drive offroad vehicle so we could reach people faster."" 'I conduct federal raids with the DEA and ATF and U.S. Marshals and the FBI and Texas Rangers' Nugent does not seem to be a cop in the way most people would understand that word. The picture was about the same for the federal agencies Nugent named. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) told us, ""We are not aware of him conducting any raids with us."" We asked the Texas Department of Public Safety on what occasions Nugent had joined Texas Rangers on raids. Press secretary Tom Vinger said, ""In regards to your question about the Texas Rangers, that did not occur."" Joe Moses, a 22-year veteran special agent at the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), told us they have no record or recollection of Nugent participating in any of their operations. However, when there are special projects that involve many federal, state and local agencies, they wouldn’t necessarily know the name of everyone who showed up. At the same time, Moses said there are strict standards for who is involved in an actual raid. ""You would not have someone who didn’t hold the status of a police officer or federal agent participate in such an operation,"" Moses said. The process of arresting a person or collecting evidence must withstand challenge in a courtroom. It is not a place for the inexperienced, Moses told us. The FBI said it could neither confirm nor deny Nugent’s participation in a raid. When we reached out to Nugent, an assistant did not provide evidence that Nugent participated in raids with the FBI, the DEA or the ATF. Instead, Nugent’s assistant Linda Peterson wrote, ""Ted has been active in the following: U.S. Marshal Service FALCON fugitive task force arrest raids in Texas …"" That’s not quite what it sounds like, either. Nugent and a film crew ""went on a ride-along with a U.S. Marshals-led task force in Waco, Texas, in 2005,"" agency spokesman Dave Oney said. Oney believes they were shooting footage for Nugent’s television show Spirit of the Wild. With the U.S. Marshals, observers work under clear limits. ""They cannot go with us into private residences,"" Oney said. ""So, he would have had to remain in the vehicle or on the sidewalk or some other public area."" That ride-along took place about nine years ago. No law enforcement agency told us that Nugent has any current role in their efforts to apprehend felons. Other evidence While Nugent’s response to our questions was brief, we did find his description of being at an FBI handgun training facility built around video simulations. The article is undated, but in it Nugent wrote he had recently taken part in Operation FALCON with the U.S. Marshals. Nugent found the training experience very realistic. ""Let me tell you, when the room goes dark and the video begins to roll, you become so totally engulfed in the scenario that you are 100 percent psychologically living the event as if it is real life,"" he wrote. ""It is no longer a video as far as your mind tells you."" It is possible this may have shaped his recollections. Our ruling Nugent said he is and has been a cop in Michigan and that he conducts raids with several federal and state law enforcement agencies. He said ""we are re-arresting fugitive felons"" and painted a vivid picture of being with agents immediately afterward. ""When we are done with these kinds of raids, we get together and our hearts are broken that we have to face these monsters,"" Nugent said. The single piece of this narrative that Nugent confirmed is one ride-along with U.S. Marshals in 2005. He is not a cop in Michigan by any conventional meaning of the word. No agency said that he presently plays any role in any of their raids. Nugent may have been passionate but his words take him far beyond the facts",False Pants on Fire,"February 27, 2014"
"More than 80 percent of Georgians don’t support legislation to ease gun restrictions in houses of worship, in bars and on campuses.","The Georgia House of Representatives recently passed legislation that would increase the types of places where guns could be allowed, but one lawmaker said most Georgians don’t support the changes. ""You are aware of the polling data that dictates the views of people in relation to this gun debate,"" Georgia state Rep. Mary Margaret Oliver, D-Decatur, said during a floor debate concerning House Bill 875. ""You are aware 80 percent-plus people don’t support these bills and these measures."" One House member who supported the legislation questioned Oliver’s numbers. PolitiFact Georgia wondered whether Oliver had accurately portrayed the people’s sentiments about the bill, or was she stretching the truth to win lawmakers to her side to vote against the bill. HB 875, written and co-sponsored by several Republican lawmakers, would lift restrictions on guns in houses of worship and bars, and allow school board members to arm themselves. It would no longer be a crime for licensed gun owners carrying a firearm on a college campus, where they are banned, under the legislation. Instead, the penalty would be a $100 fine. The bill does includes some restrictions, such as the mentally ill cannot get a gun license. Despite Oliver’s protestations, the House overwhelmingly passed the bill by a 119-56 margin. Like many contentious bills, the vote went along party lines, with nearly all Republicans voting in favor of the legislation and virtually all Democrats against it.The legislation is now in the hands of the Georgia Senate. Oliver said in her speech before fellow lawmakers that she asked people in her district how they felt about legislation that would expand gun rights in such fashion. Only 10 said they supported it while 156 said they opposed it. That, however, was not a scientific survey. Since Oliver’s district covers only a portion of DeKalb County, we wanted to know what information she had to support her claim concerning how voters statewide felt about legislation like HB 875. Oliver sent us a January poll by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that found 72 percent of registered voters statewide oppose allowing firearms in houses of worship, while 26 percent said they favored the idea. The remaining 2 percent either did not answer or were not sure how they felt about the idea. The question offered some interesting findings. Sixty-three percent of Republicans opposed the idea, while more than 90 percent of Democrats opposed it. A higher percentage of voters older than 65 were against the idea than those between the ages of 18 and 39. More than four out of five women said they were against allowing firearms in churches, while about 60 percent of men opposed the idea. The poll also asked how did people feel about allowing people to carry firearms on college campuses and in dorms. Seventy-eight percent said they oppose the idea. Again, it showed a higher percentage of women were against the idea than men. Again, it showed a larger percentage of older voters were against the idea than younger voters. Seventy-one percent of Republicans polled said they were against allowing firearms on college campuses. More than 90 percent of Democrats opposed the idea. The AJC poll surveyed 802 adults statewide between Jan. 6 and Jan. 9 on what issues Georgians want their Legislature to tackle in 2014. The margin of error for each response is plus or minus 4 percentage points. It was conducted by Abt SRBI of New York by live operators and included respondents via cellphone and land line. Oliver also sent us data from a poll conducted by Georgians for Gun Safety in 2010. It showed 76 percent of the respondents felt the state ""definitely should not"" allow anyone with a gun permit to carry a firearm into a house of worship. An additional 10 percent said Georgia ""probably should not"" allow gun permit holder to carry in a house of worship. The Georgians for Gun Safety poll also asked for the public’s opinion about allowing people to carry firearms onto a college campus. Sixty-four percent responded ""definitely should not"" while an additional 12 percent answered ""probably should not."" In 2013, Atlanta’s NBC affiliate, 11 Alive, polled Georgians on the topic. It found 64 percent thought it should ""remain unlawful"" for firearms to be carried into churches. Twenty-six percent supported the idea. Sixty-five percent of those who responded to the poll said the law should be illegal to carry firearms on college campuses.   To sum up, Oliver said more than 80 percent of Georgians do not support measures like those proposed in House Bill 875. Most of the polling data we reviewed shows a majority of Georgians oppose firearms in houses of worship or on college campuses. But there’s not much data that we saw that surpasses the 80 percent mark. Oliver’s overall point that most Georgians oppose firearms in bars, on campus or in houses of worship is on the mark. But her specific percentage is too high, and she used the number to pursue a specific political point",Half True,"February 26, 2014"
"""Mitch McConnell voted with Harry Reid to infringe on our gun rights.""","Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell may have the backing of the National Rifle Association in his quest for a sixth term as Kentucky’s U.S. Senator, but his Republican primary opponent insists McConnell is weak on Second Amendment issues. Businessman Matt Bevin released a 15-second TV ad on Feb. 19, 2014, that not only attacked McConnell’s record on guns, but claimed McConnell’s positions were closely aligned with his Democratic counterpart, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada. ""Mitch McConnell voted with Harry Reid to infringe on our gun rights,"" the ad said. ""Matt Bevin always support the Second Amendment. The choice is clear."" We were surprised to see McConnell attacked on his support of the Second Amendment, having just won the ""Defender of Freedom"" award from the NRA. So we took a deeper dive into this ad to see what it’s getting at. Dissecting the 1991 crime bill The ad isn’t referencing the gun debate of the last two years — or even of the last two decades. Instead, Bevin’s campaign points to a Senate vote from 1991, when McConnell was just starting his second term in office, to support the claim. Back then, President George H.W. Bush sent an anti-crime bill to Congress that would ""toughen a number of laws to cover more violent crimes and would impose the death penalty for certain federal offenses,"" according to a Boston Globe report from the time. Democrats, who controlled both chambers of Congress, were critical of the bill for not addressing ownership of assault weapons and other gun control measures. And though Bush called for the bill to be passed within 100 days, a contentious showdown ensued. The Senate version of the bill, called the Violent Crime Control Act of 1991 and proposed by then-Sen. Joe Biden, D-Del., included an assault weapons ban from the outset and a seven-day waiting period to purchase handguns. The sprawling bill also sent $1 billion to local law enforcement agencies and courts, and expanded mandatory minimum sentencing and use of the death penalty. Senators filed hundreds of amendments to the legislation. Two of the most controversial dealt with gun ownership. A compromise measure shrunk the waiting period to purchase a handgun to five days and laid out parameters for a speedy federal background check. It passed with significant Republican support. But not from McConnell, who opposed any wait period on background checks, his campaign said. The Kentucky senator joined 23 Republicans and eight Democrats to vote against the five-day waiting period. (Reid voted for the measure). The other notable amendment was an NRA-backed measure that would have completely eliminated the waiting period to buy handguns. Before the vote, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, a proponent of the amendment, told his colleagues, ""Everybody here better understand this is the key vote"" that will tell whether ""you're either for or against the Second Amendment right to buy arms."" McConnell voted for the NRA’s amendment. Reid did as well. But it did not pass, only mustering 44 votes. The vote that Bevin’s ad singled out was neither of those, but a vote on final passage of the Senate version of the omnibus crime bill, which passed 71-36. McConnell joined Reid in voting for the measure. McConnell also voted to invoke cloture and end debate on the bill earlier in the day. McConnell’s campaign said he only backed the bill because he supported the tougher sentences and money for local police, and to push the bill into a conference committee with the House, where he hoped the gun measures would be removed. Bevin’s campaign said that ""is the classic Washington way of pretending you are against something in your state, but support the measure in Washington"" and he should have worked to defeat the measure entirely. Killing the bill But in fact, McConnell did work to defeat the final bill. Though the Senate crime bill had support from President Bush, House and Senate Democrats and Republicans couldn’t agree to a comprehensive measure in the conference committee. Instead, the Democratic majority forced through a bill that had less bipartisan support. The conference bill passed the House by two votes but stalled in the Senate for the rest of 1991 and 1992 under the threat of veto from Bush. With a filibuster in place, Senate Democrats couldn’t reach the 60 votes needed to pass the bill, despite three attempts, in part because the compromise bill had tighter gun restrictions. All three times the bill came up for a cloture vote to end debate, McConnell voted against it. Reid, however, voted to invoke cloture twice and once did not vote at all. So that was 1991. In 2013, McConnell held his caucus firmly together against attempts to restrict and regulate gun purchases after the December 2012 Connecticut school shooting at Newtown. The Senate failed to reach the 60 votes needed on measures to expand background checks on gun purchases, to ban assault weapons and to restrict high capacity magazines. McConnell voted no each time and under his stewardship, Republicans blocked the bills from passing. Reid voted in favor of the assault weapon and high capacity magazine bans. He voted against the expanded background checks, a procedural move that allowed him to bring the amendment up for vote again in the future. Our ruling Bevin’s ad says ""Mitch McConnell voted with Harry Reid to infringe on our gun rights."" The ad focuses on a vote McConnell took more than 22 years ago on a massive crime bill that included dozens of votes and amendments and didn’t even pass Congress. The law failed, with McConnell voting against it, and Reid voting for it. On amendments, McConnell sided with firearm lobbyists when a closely watched provision came up for a vote. The only evidence the Bevin campaign offered was that McConnell voted to advance the bill to a conference committee (as did Reid), but that was a brief point in the legislative process. To hang this attack on a handful of long-ago votes — when he much more recently helped kill gun control legislation — is absurd. So overall, Bevin’s add goes back to 1991 to cherry-pick votes and make it seem like McConnell and Reid were on the same side. Actually, McConnell repeatedly voted against the 1991 bill, on both its gun restrictions and the overall measure. The claim that McConnell voted with Harry Reid to infringe gun rights is contradicted by many other votes, both then and now",False Pants on Fire,"February 24, 2014"
"Kip Kinkel and Clackamas Town Center shootings ""both where citizen with gun stopped the crime""","Gun-control proposals, both in Oregon and nationally, continue to generate controversy. Even ideas with widespread public support, such as universal background checks, ignite fierce debates. That much was clear Feb. 6, 2014, when Mark Kelly, the husband of former Arizona Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords -- who was critically injured in a 2011 shooting -- testified at an Oregon legislative hearing in favor of a bill that would expand background checks. A member of the Oregon Citizens Lobby, a conservative activist group, took to Twitter to say that Kelly was testifying. The tweet indicated that Kelly’s remarks included mention of Kip Kinkel, who shot and killed his parents before killing two fellow Thurston High School students in 1998, and the Dec. 11, 2012, shooting at Clackamas Town Center that left three people, including the shooter, dead. ""He mentions Kip Kinkle (sic) & Clackamas TC,"" the tweet continued, ""both where citizen with gun stopped the crime."" The tweet caught our attention. Were both of those tragic incidents halted when armed citizens intervened? PolitiFact Oregon checked. We checked the Oregon Citizens Lobby’s website but found it contains no phone numbers. It does list email contacts for subjects including health care, taxes, education and ""law enforcement, military and firearms."" We emailed the latter and received a reply from someone who identified himself only as ""Bill D., Team lead, Oregon Citizens Lobby, Law Enforcement, Military and Firearms."" (In a subsequent email, he declined to give his full name.) Regarding the Town Center shooting, Bill D. wrote, ""Clackamas Mall is easy...the Oregonian covered it well."" The email provided a link to a story in The Oregonian and on OregonLive.com, which reported the account of Nick Meli, who told authorities he trained his own gun on mall shooter Jacob Tyler Roberts. Meli didn’t shoot for fear of hitting a bystander, according to one of several statements he gave to police and reporters. The story added that Meli also told a local television station that Roberts appeared to spot him ""and that afterward, Meli heard only one more shot, and suspects it was the one Roberts used to kill himself."" Bill D.’s email then addressed the Thurston High School shooting. It retracted that part of the initial tweet, saying: ""...other students (unarmed) tackled Kip Kinkel. The tweet was likely in error here."" So far, the group, was batting .500 on the original tweet’s accuracy. We agree that no one with a gun stopped Kinkel. News accounts and official reports show that brothers Jake and Josh Ryker and classmate Tony Case tackled Kinkel while he was trying to reload and held him until police arrived. To fact-check Meli’s role in the Town Square shootings, we called the Clackamas County Sheriff’s Office, which took the lead in investigating the incident. ""It’s inconclusive on our end,"" said Lt. Robert Wurpes, office spokesman. ""We can’t say either way whether he did or did not make a difference. It would only be speculation."" Other news accounts in the days after the shooting indicated that Meli changed his story slightly. According to police reports, Meli’s first contact with deputies took place as the search for Roberts was still unfolding. Meli had a handgun out when officers first saw him. He provided information about the shooter but did not mention a confrontation with Roberts. The next day, Meli told police he saw Roberts and drew his gun but didn’t fire out of fear of striking someone. The day after that, Meli added that Roberts looked at him and saw that Meli saw him before running off, according to a story by Rick Bella of The Oregonian. After that, Meli cut interviews short. His silence, Bella wrote, ""has effectively divided the public into two camps: One that believes Meli is a hero, a good guy with a gun who stopped a bad guy with a gun, preventing further bloodshed. The other believes Meli embellished his story to take undue credit."" When we emailed the Oregon Citizens Lobby for a response, ""BD"" responded by writing: ""Cops will not declare that a private citizen stopped a shooting unless the evidence is absolutely incontrovertible. Quotes from them are usually taken before an investigation is complete and they of course don’t want to prejudice the investigation."" A member of the Oregon Citizens Lobby tweeted during a gun-control hearing that the Thurston and Clackamas Town Center shootings were stopped by armed bystanders. The Oregon Citizens Lobby acknowledged it erred in the Thurston case. Nick Meli’s role at Clackamas Town Center remains open to debate. Did his drawn weapon prompt the shooter to flee? There is no proof that it did",False,"February 12, 2014"
"""According to (Barack) Obama’s newest unconstitutionally enacted law, health care professionals are now required to violate HIPAA privacy laws and submit medical data to the government,"" which is ""then used as justification for gun confiscation.""","Three of the biggest hot buttons in politics these days are health care, privacy and guns. Put all three of them together and you get an explosive claim. A reader recently asked us to look into a blog post at the website Mr. Conservative, with the provocative headline, ""Obama Quietly Uses Executive Orders For Two New Gun Control Laws."" ""Just a few weeks ago,"" the post said, President Barack Obama ""quietly used executive action — one of his new favorite pastimes — that has got gun owners’ feathers in a ruffle. According to Obama’s newest unconstitutionally enacted law, health care professionals are now required to violate HIPAA privacy laws and submit medical data to the government. The illegally obtained data is then used as justification for gun confiscation by the federal government."" Mr. Conservative’s claims don’t have to do with Obama’s health care law. Obamacare explicitly bars the collection of information about ""the lawful ownership or possession of a firearm or ammunition"" or the maintenance of ""records of individual ownership or possession of a firearm or ammunition."" Rather, at issue is a proposed rule that would clarify some currently murky interpretations of privacy restrictions under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, which set limits on who can share and receive private health information about individuals. The provision cited in the blog post is designed to make clear that state authorities are allowed to share certain information to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS, which is used to screen potential gun purchasers. Under existing federal law, several factors can prevent someone from buying a gun. Most of these have to do with law-enforcement issues, such as a prior felony conviction or a record of domestic abuse. Another one -- the one that’s important for this discussion because it intersects with the health care system -- is involuntary commitment to a mental institution. The instant background check system is supposed to streamline the process of gun purchasing by quickly weeding out those who cannot legally buy a gun. But such a system is only as good as the databases it’s linked to. If someone is ineligible to purchase a gun but their information didn’t get into the right database, then the background check won’t stop the purchase. Several analyses have shown that these databases are far from complete. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, privacy is a key reason cited by states that haven’t provided data about involuntary commitments. The federal government’s argument is that these states are being needlessly cautious. The government says the kind of data being sought for background checks isn’t subject to HIPAA’s privacy restrictions. The HHS proposal would explicitly clarify that point. Let’s take a look at the claim phrase by phrase. • It’s an ""unconstitutionally enacted law."" Like the old-timey drink known as an egg cream -- which includes neither egg nor cream -- this provision isn’t a law, it isn’t enacted yet and it’s not unconstitutional. A law is a bill passed by Congress and signed by the president; that doesn’t describe this provision. Nor is it an ""executive order,"" the term used in the headline. Executive orders are directives written and personally signed by the president. Instead, it’s an administrative regulation. Specifically, it’s a notice of proposed rulemaking issued by the Department of Health and Human Services. In other words, it’s a policy proposal emerging from a federal agency, with a specified public comment period before the agency decides whether to enact it -- or scrap it. So while it’s fair to say the Obama administration is behind it, it would be incorrect to say it’s already ""enacted."" It’s currently in the comment phase, and it may not ever be enacted. As for ""unconstitutional,"" the Supreme Court, for one, doesn’t consider the regulatory process to be problematic constitutionally. ""Some people do question the constitutionality of the administrative state, but as far as the Supreme Court is concerned, it's been settled law for almost 100 years that Congress can delegate rulemaking authority to federal agencies,"" said Kermit Roosevelt, a University of Pennsylvania law professor. • ""Health care professionals are now required to violate HIPAA privacy laws to submit medical data to the government"" The information reportable to NICS doesn’t concern physicians’ medical records about diagnoses of mental illness, prescriptions, or treatment recommendations. Rather, the relevant information for gun-buying purposes -- and thus for providing data to NICS -- are decisions by ""a court, board, commission, or other lawful authority."" As HHS put it when it released the proposed rule, ""Seeking help for mental health problems or getting treatment does not make someone legally prohibited from having a firearm, and nothing in this proposed rule changes that. Furthermore, nothing in this proposed rule would require reporting on general mental health visits or other routine mental health care, or exempt providers solely performing these treatment services from existing privacy rules."" Importantly, HHS added that ""the proposed modifications would merely permit, and not require, covered entities to report to the NICS."" That directly conflicts with the blog post’s claim. So, let’s recap: ""Health care professionals"" is misleading -- it’s courts, boards and commissions, not doctors, who would be submitting to NICS. ""Are now"" is wrong because, as we noted, this is a proposal and is not in force yet. ""Required"" is wrong because state entities would be able to submit to NICS, but would not be required to do so. ""To violate HIPAA privacy laws"" is at best misleading because HIPAA already didn’t block the transfer of this kind of data; the proposed rule simply makes that point extra clear. And ""to submit medical data to the government"" is misleading because only involuntary commitment data is sought by NICS, not detailed treatment records. • It’s ""justification for gun confiscation"" The idea that Obama wants to take away Americans’ guns is a durable one among his critics. But it’s unclear the extent to which the HHS proposal would make this scenario more likely. On the surface, all NICS does is prevent ineligible people from newly purchasing a gun. It says nothing about taking away the guns they already own. But if someone is unable to purchase a gun, it also means they’re unable to own a gun. The question is how aggressively this is enforced. Critics of the proposal say that increasing the flow of mental-health information to NICS could promote rise in confiscation. If enacted, the proposal ""would make it clear that the ATF and other federal agencies could troll this database for persons with Alzheimer's, PTSD, ADHD, etc.,"" said Michael Hammond, legislative counsel for Gun Owners of America, a group that has been critical of the HHS proposal. In the group’s official comments to HHS on the proposal, it cited a letter from Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., that says that 140,000 veterans have been added to the NICS list over the years. Coburn and Gun Owners of America say too many of these veterans are being caught up in the dragnet. In addition, California in 2013 passed a law that allocated $24 million to enforce the confiscation of firearms from people who are not allowed to own them, using a variety of databases; about 30 percent of these people were mentally ill. While NICS only accepts into its database the official determinations of mental incompetency, Hammond warned that there’s no universal standard for incompetency determinations. They may be ""made with little more than a psychiatric diagnosis and perhaps a star-chamber proceeding, in which a supposedly incompetent person is deemed competent to have waived all of his or her rights,"" Hammond said. ""This would mean that the names of persons who had received little due process"" might find their information newly added to NICS, leaving them open to confiscation. But even if these are legitimate concerns, others don’t see the HIPAA proposal as a harbinger of massive gun confiscations. Mark Heyrman, professor at the University of Chicago Law School, called any kind of large-scale gun confiscation effort based on the HHS action ""implausible."" Jay Corzine, a sociologist who studies gun policy at the University of Central Florida, agreed, saying the proposal strikes a ""reasonable"" balance. Federal law ""proscribes possession of a firearm by persons in these groups and could conceivably lead to seizure of firearms owned prior to their change in status,"" he said. ""This currently occurs in selected situations -- domestic violence cases in some states for example. Not very many people would be impacted, however, and the idea that this is the opening move in a planned campaign for large-scale gun confiscation is far-fetched at best."" Our ruling The post we’re checking said that, ""according to (Barack) Obama’s newest unconstitutionally enacted law, health care professionals are now required to violate HIPAA privacy laws and submit medical data to the government,"" which is ""then used as justification for gun confiscation."" The elements of this claim range from misleading to flat-out wrong. The one area of reasonable concern is that some jurisdictions may lack full due process for declaring someone mentally incompetent, potentially putting some people at risk of seeing their guns confiscated. But this depends on how proactively the authorities enforce gun laws. Experts say widespread gun confiscation is implausible. The rule isn’t a law, it isn’t enacted and it isn’t unconstitutional according to Supreme Court jurisprudence. It isn’t a requirement, and it doesn’t involve routine diagnostic data compiled by ""health care professionals"" such as doctors",False,"February 6, 2014"
"Deer baiting, planned for Block Island by DEM, is illegal in Rhode Island.","Nothing gets under people's skin like the government engaging in activity that is illegal for everyone else, such as when Congress passes laws and then exempts itself from them. On Jan. 12, 2014, in a letter to The Providence Journal, Richard August, co-host of the WHJJ radio show ""Lock, Stock and Daria,"" asserted that the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management would be doing exactly that if it carries out its plan to hire professional hunters to cull the deer population on Block Island. According to the plan, the hunters would use feeding stations to lure the deer. ""Baiting deer happens to be illegal in Rhode Island,"" August wrote. ""But I guess if you are the state, the laws don’t apply."" We wondered what the law actually said. First, some background. Block Island, officially known as New Shoreham, is overrun by deer -- an estimated 800 to 1,000 on the 9.5-square mile island. The town and the DEM have agreed on a plan to hire a Connecticut firm to reduce the population to 150 or fewer over the next four years. Corn bait will be used to lure deer to 15 to 20 sites on the southwestern part of the island. Sharpshooters perched on raised platforms will shoot the deer. Their goal for this winter is to kill about 200, beginning in the last week of February. The carcasses will be carved into venison using a mobile meat processing service based in Maine. The meat will be offered first to Block Island residents; the rest will be distributed to the Rhode Island Community Food Bank and other hunger programs. Going back to August's claim, the ""Deer Hunting"" section of state law says the DEM can adopt rules and regulations on deer hunting in Rhode Island but, ""In any event, the following prohibitions and restrictions shall always apply to deer hunting:"" Paragraph 6 says, ""No person shall make, set, or use any trap or snare, or salt lick or other device for the purpose of ensnaring, enticing, taking, injuring, or killing a deer."" When we asked the DEM about this, the department released a statement through spokeswoman Gail Mastrati saying that the rule only applies to ""recreational hunting."" That's not what the DEM would be doing, she said. ""The bait and shoot deer reduction project on Block Island, authorized under emergency regulations filed by DEM on Nov. 7, 2013, to address a serious problem on the island, is not a recreational hunting activity,"" her statement said. ""A bait and shoot deer reduction effort is very different from recreational hunting. The knowledge of animal behavior and the discipline and skills in marksmanship are more sophisticated and strategic than those necessary to be a successful recreational deer hunter."" The ""deer hunting"" section of state law does not make any distinction between recreational and non-recreational hunting. We asked the DEM about that. The department responded in an email: ""Hunting regulations do not apply to the deer culling operation because it is not a hunting activity. Rather, it is a wildlife management action authorized under DEM's statutory authority."" We'll leave it up to others to debate whether the culling of the island’s deer herd is really a hunt and, if so, whether the state’s hunting laws should apply to the DEM. (We should note, for example, that most of us have no problem with agents of the state, such as police officers, ignoring traffic signals or speed limits when chasing criminals.) But when Richard August asserts that state law makes it illegal for hunters to use bait to lure deer, which is what the DEM plans to do when it stages a mass shooting of deer, he is correct",True,"January 26, 2014"
"""Americans are 20 times as likely to die from gun violence as citizens of other civilized countries.""","As shootings at a Florida theater and a New Mexico school rocked the news this week, CNN host Piers Morgan greeted viewers Tuesday with alarming stats about gun violence. Then one of Morgan’s guests jumped in with numbers of her own. After questioning the sheriff investigating the theater killing, Morgan turned to Lisa Bloom, a lawyer and author of Swagger: 10 Urgent Rules for Raising Boys in an Era of Failing Schools, Mass Joblessness, and Thug Culture. ""Let me give you another number: 20,"" Bloom said. ""Americans are 20 times as likely to die from gun violence as citizens of other civilized countries. Why? Because other civilized countries rein in guns."" We can’t quantify whether gun policies are preventing gun violence, as Bloom said, but we can look at her claim that ""Americans are 20 times as likely to die from gun violence as citizens of other civilized countries."" First of all, it’s not typical to refer to peers of the United States as ""civilized countries."" More often, they are grouped as ""developed,"" ""advanced industrial"" or ""high-income countries,"" many being in Western Europe. When we asked Bloom what she meant, she directed us to a Washington Post infographic comparing gun-related murders per capita for the United States and the nations of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The global consortium of 34 countries includes Western Europe, Turkey, Israel, Chile, Japan and South Korea. Mexico is also in the group, but the Post did not include it because its murder rate is exceptionally high amid a drug war. (The OECD considers all but Mexico, Chile and Turkey as ""advanced"" countries. Those three are ""emerging."") The United States is tops -- way tops -- for gun deaths, with a 2010 rate of 3.2 firearm-related deaths per 100,000 population, according to statistics collected by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. Chile was second at 2.2, followed by Turkey and Switzerland, tied for third at 0.8. The rest of the countries fell below 1, if they made the map at all. The U.S. rate is more than 20 times the rate of Australia, France, the United Kingdom (excluding Northern Ireland), Israel, South Korea, Japan, Norway, Poland and Slovenia. The U.S. rate firearm-related deaths is closer to 10 or 16 times the rates of countries such as Austria, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Netherlands, New Zealand and Spain. (Country to country comparisons are slightly imperfect due to the variance in how data is reported. For example, the rate for Turkey and Switzerland is based on each country’s most recently reported year, which is 2006 and 2004, respectively. You can see more on this Google spreadsheet we compiled using U.N. data for firearm death rates from 2004 to 2010.) Post foreign affairs blogger Max Fisher concluded, ""The U.S. gun murder rate is about 20 times the average for all other countries on this chart. That means that Americans are 20 times as likely to be killed by a gun than is someone from another developed country."" A related fact-check from PolitiFact examined a 2011 study by researchers of the Harvard School of Public Health and UCLA School of Public Health. Their findings, while based on data for 23 high-income, populous countries from the World Health Organization now almost a decade old (2003), mirror more recent trends. The United States, they found, has more firearms per capita, the most permissive gun control laws and a disproportionate amount of firearm-related deaths from homicides, suicides and accidents. ""The United States had a homicide rate 6.9 times higher than those in the other high-income countries, driven by a ﬁrearm homicide rate that was 19.5 times higher than those in the other high-income countries,"" the report says. ""For 15 year olds to 24 year olds, the ﬁrearm homicide rate in the United States was 42.7 times higher than in the other countries."" Bloom said her particular statistic is widely reported, and she will include more stats on gun deaths in her upcoming book, Suspicion Nation. ""No matter how you analyze the data, the numbers are deeply disturbing,"" she said. Our ruling Bloom said, ""Americans are 20 times as likely to die from gun violence as citizens of other civilized countries."" Her phrasing is imperfect (""civilized"" countries versus ""developed""), and depending on what countries you count  you can reach a slightly different figure. But Bloom’s point is well-sourced and largely accurate. The United States has a much higher rate of the world’s most developed countries",Mostly True,"January 17, 2014"
"A gun ""background check is futile. Something like 42 (people during the) last year … were prosecuted for trying to buy a gun with a criminal record out of 11 million.""","Fox News Sunday used the one-year anniversary of the school shooting in Newtown, Conn., to renew the gun debate. Carlee Soto, the sister of Newtown victim and Sandy Hook Elementary School teacher Victoria Soto, and Mark Kelly, the husband of former Rep. Gabby Giffords, both advocated for a failed Senate bill that would expand background checks on gun purchases. Larry Pratt, the executive director of Gun Owners of America, countered by calling for more guns in schools. He also dismissed the Senate legislation. ""The background check is futile,"" Pratt said. ""Something like 42 (people during the) last year … were prosecuted for trying to buy a gun with a criminal record out of 11 million."" This talking point came up quite a bit in the months after the Sandy Hook shooting. The numbers aren’t far off, but they also doesn’t get at the heart of what a background check accomplishes. If 42 people out of 11 million were the only ones deterred from legally buying a gun because of a background check, then maybe ""futile"" would be an accurate description. After all, that’s only 1 in every 262,000 applications. But before we get into the other elements of a background check, let’s get the numbers right. Since the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993 went into effect, federally licensed firearms dealers and state and federal authorities have used the FBI background check system to determine whether an individual can legally purchase a firearm. Pratt’s claim that 11 million background checks were conducted during the last year of record is a high estimate, but not by much. According to the U.S. Department of Justice Bureau of Justice Statistics, it’s actually around 10.4 million in 2010, the latest year on file. He’s also not far off on the number of prosecutions. A report by the Regional Justice Information Service ""Enforcement of the Brady Act, 2010,"" showed 62 charges were filed by U.S. attorneys across the country in response to background checks. Of those charges, 18 were dropped, putting the tally at 44, a couple more than Pratt’s number. However, that doesn’t include local charges in states that conduct their own checks. As PolitiFact noted earlier this year while conducting a similar fact-check on comments from Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., that’s likely to increase the total number of prosecutions. In his research, Ronald Frandsen, grants administrator for the Regional Justice Information Service, found that in the four states that voluntarily report local cases — Colorado, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Virginia — 1,520 arrests were noted. Another 17 states that conduct background checks themselves were not included. ""You’d have to say (the total number of arrests) would be higher,"" Frandsen told PolitiFact at the time. ""There’s no question."" Pratt is also ignoring all the individuals who were denied weapons up front because they could not pass a background check. In 2010, 153,000 applications to purchase a firearm or obtain a permit were blocked. The most common reason an application is denied is because the customer has a previous felony conviction or indictment, making up almost half of all denials for federal checks and one-third of state checks. It’s still a small percentage of all the applications processed, about 1.5 percent, but it’s much more than Pratt lets one believe. Our ruling Pratt said ""the background check is futile. Something like 42 (people during the) last year of record were prosecuted for trying to buy a gun with a criminal record out of 11 million."" He is a little off in his numbers, but they’re close. However, his statement also paints just a partial picture of the entire background check procedure and how authorities and gun sellers use it to keep criminals from purchasing weapons. To make a bold claim like the system is ""futile"" and then leave out the thousands of individuals denied a firearm because of a background check is misleading",Half True,"December 15, 2013"
"""The vast, overwhelming majority of [crimes that occur with a firearm] are committed by people who don’t legally possess that firearm in the first place.""","The adage, ""If guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns,"" has been around at least since the 1980s. During an appearance on WPRO's Matt Allen show, state Rep. Michael Chippendale, a Republican from Foster, made a similar point when talking about gun owners and the fact that it is illegal in Rhode Island for state government to maintain a gun registry. ""I think if we were to analyze all police records, we'd find that crimes that occur with a firearm are not perpetrated by lawful firearm owners,"" he said. ""I would say the vast, overwhelming majority of them are committed by people who don’t legally possess that firearm in the first place. So they wouldn't show up on any sort of a register because they didn't obtain it legally. There's a strong argument that is supported by data, a lot of data, to support that point."" It seems reasonable that most criminals probably wouldn’t go through legal channels to get the weapon they use in a crime, but we were interested in determining whether that was true for the overwhelming majority of cases. So we asked Chippendale about the data. He emailed us to say his data disappeared when his computer died about a month ago. But he said an analysis of crimes in Providence in 2012 by a firearms advocacy group showed that, as he remembered it, among 110 or so actual arrests in which a firearm was seized, the weapon was returned to the owner in fewer than 10 instances. Those, of course, would be the legal owners. When we asked him for hard evidence, he sent us several Internet links, none of which directly addressed the question. It turns out, despite Chippendale’s assertion, there's not a lot of data to support his point. In Rhode Island, we checked with the attorney general's office, Providence's commissioner of public safety, and the Superior Court, which has its own gun court. None collect data in a form that would allow easy analysis of the question. The commissioner, Steven Pare, expressed surprise that any of the guns seized in 2012 would have been returned. ""It's rare that we return a gun that's been seized"" unless it's returned to someone who reported it stolen, he said. Nationally, we checked with some firearm groups and academics who study gun violence. None who responded had statistics that addressed the issue. ""You're probably not going to find direct evidence of the statement, since law enforcement agencies don't generally check specifically for legal possession, and certainly don't keep any centralized data that can be used to assess the claim,"" said David M. Kennedy, director of the National Network for Safe Communities and the Center for Crime Prevention and Control at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York. Nonetheless, Kennedy said Chippendale’s statement ""is absolutely true. The overwhelming majority of gun crime is committed by chronic offenders who are legally prohibited from owning firearms; they have felony records or domestic violence misdemeanors, which are disqualifying under federal law. So by definition they can't own guns legally.""   We did, however, manage to find two sources of hard data. In 1997, the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics surveyed more than 203,000 prisoners. Among state prison inmates, only 14 percent reported getting their weapon from a retail outlet such as a store, pawn shop, flea market or gun show. An additional 13 percent said they had purchased it or obtained it in trade from a family member or friend, which wouldn't necessarily make them legal owners, especially in states like Rhode Island that require a background check with a private sale. Overall, the study found, no more than one quarter were legal owners of their weapons, assuming the inmates interviewed were telling the truth about whether their firearm acquisition was legal. The other source is a December 2012 study that looked at handgun-tracing data for firearms recovered by the police between 2003 and 2006, as logged through the California Dealer Record of Sale system, which tracks sales of firearms beyond the initial dealer. The team led by Glenn Pierce of Northeastern University, in Boston, found that in 31 percent of the cases, the gun belonged to the people who were found with them. In fewer than half the cases -- 47 percent -- the last recorded owners and the people who possessed the guns were different. In 22 percent of the cases, there was not enough information to make a determination. Pierce cautioned that some of these 10,273 confiscations don't include the types of gun-related crimes that Chippendale was talking about. For example, they include cases in which guns happened to be recovered during routine traffic stops. If those are taken out, he said, ""my guess is there would be the same or even fewer legally owned guns."" Our ruling Rep. Michael Chippendale said: ""The vast overwhelming majority of [crimes that occur with a firearm] are committed by people who don’t legally possess that firearm in the first place."" Chippendale was wrong when he said there was ""a lot of data"" to back his claim. We found very little. The few studies we did find suggested that at least a majority of perpetrators of gun crimes don’t legally possess the guns they used.

Steve Stockman filed just before the deadline to run against incumbent Republican U.S. Sen. John Cornyn. Assessing the matchup of two conservative candidates, Huffington Post columnist Howard Fineman said Stockman’s world is all about guns. ""This is a guy who not only doesn't want gun-free zones around schools. He basically wants gun-filled zones in schools,"" Fineman said on MSNBC’s All In with Chris Hayes. We decided to check Fineman’s assertion. At the start of this year, a few weeks after the Newtown, Conn., shootings, Stockman introduced the Safe Schools Act of 2013. The bill was very simple. It would repeal a federal law that bans everyone except law enforcement from bringing a weapon inside a school. The bill’s stated purpose was ""to restore safety to America's schools by allowing staff, teachers, and administrators to defend the children and themselves."" There is no question that Stockman envisioned more people with firearms at schools. ""Stockman clearly likes that scenario,"" said David Kopel, an associate policy analyst with the libertarian Cato Institute and a proponent of Second Amendment rights. Where Kopel differs with Fineman’s rhetorical flourish is on the point of whether the schools would be full of guns. ""When I think of a gun-filled zone, I think of a gun show or going to the annual meeting of the NRA (National Rifle Association) where you know that you are never more than 50 feet from someone with a conceal carry permit and a gun,"" Kopel said. So, Kopel says Fineman engaged in a bit of exaggeration. The other supporters of gun rights we reached said the whole point of Stockman’s bill was to give principals, teachers and staff the ability to defend themselves and their students. We asked Stockman’s office for evidence that more guns would yield more security and did not hear back. But Kopel and Erich Pratt, director of communications for Gun Owners of America, both pointed to the example in Pearl, Miss., where a student opened fire in 1997. An assistant principal ran out to his car where he kept a gun and successfully apprehended the shooter. Pratt also said a Centers for Disease Control study found that the number of times a gun was used defensively was much greater than the number of times a gun was used to kill someone. The actual words from the report, which was a survey of past research, were a bit more nuanced. The authors noted that there was much debate about the data and said ""defensive gun uses by victims are at least as common as offensive uses by criminals."" The report added that gun-using crime victims have lower injury rates than victims who use other defensive strategies, however it noted that we don’t know if that protective benefit outweighs the deaths and injuries associated with gun ownership in general. The gun debate is fueled by conflicting values and studies. David Hemenway, professor of health policy at Harvard School of Public Health, said he knows of no report that shows that armed civilians provide a protective factor. In his view, the evidence speaks to quite the opposite conclusion. ""Studies do show that where there are more households with guns, all other things equal, there is more homicide because there is more gun homicide,"" Hemenway said. Our experts could not point to research on whether armed school personnel would afford the students greater safety, largely because most states don’t allow guns inside schools and episodes of gunmen opening fire in schools are rare. ""It’s hard for social science to do studies of such low frequency events,"" Kopel said. Our ruling Fineman said that Stockman ""basically wants gun-filled schools."" Stockman did introduce a bill that would make it easier for states to allow school personnel to carry firearms. The bill’s stated purpose was to allow those people to defend themselves and their students from an armed intruder. Our experts agreed that Stockman’s goal was to see more firearms inside schools. We did not hear from Stockman’s office so there is no way to know if he envisioned an upper limit to that increase. Based on his bill itself, there would be none",True,"December 13, 2013"
"Passing a federal firearms ""background check through the NICS database . . . typically takes 90 seconds.""","Imagine contacting the federal government and getting what you need in 90 seconds. U.S. Rep. James Langevin says that's how long it takes to get a federal background check if you're seeking to buy a firearm. The statement comes in a Dec. 3 news release, issued jointly with Rep. David Cicilline, calling for ""a more effective background check process"" that includes mental health records that Rhode Island, under law, is prevented from giving to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). (A General Assembly commission is exploring whether to modify the law.) Langevin reports, ""The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993 requires an individual to pass a background check through the NICS database before purchasing a firearm from a federally licensed dealer, a process that typically takes 90 seconds."" Why is the 90 seconds important to the gun control issue? Langevin spokeswoman Meg Fraser said it shows that ""running a background check is generally a quick process, and adding additional records to the system would not result in a significant change or inconvenience to the customer."" There are days when we can't get a cup of coffee at Starbucks in 90 seconds, so we wondered if the background check process is really that quick. We turned to people who use the system regularly. Robert Carney, owner of Post Road Guns on Plainfield Pike, in Cranston, said it's true that it usually takes 90 seconds or less for the NICS to search its database and determine whether a customer is eligible to purchase a weapon. And he does it with a phone call, not with a computer. The same is true for Adam Dacko, of Foster Bear Arms & Trading Post, in Foster. He estimated that 75 percent to 90 percent of the checks are completed within 45 seconds. Delays may occur if someone has a common name and doesn’t provide a Social Security number, which is optional. ""It takes longer for me to read off the form than it does for me to get a response,"" he said.   Which brings up another point: That's not the whole process. Carney showed us Form 4473 from the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which must be filled out first. It requires basic information such as height, weight and gender, along with questions about whether the would-be buyer is under indictment, has been convicted of a felony, has received a dishonorable discharge from the military, is addicted to any controlled substance, or is subject to a restraining order for harassing, stalking or threatening a child, ""intimate partner or the child of an intimate partner."" It took us just under three minutes to fill out the form's 27 questions and sign it. The seller must then confirm the buyer's identification, contact the NICS system, recite all the information on the form over the phone to an operator (or type it into the computer), and take down the confirmation information supplied through the NICS system. That would take a few more minutes. Gun dealer Robert Swinehart of Arquebus Co., in West Warwick, said the whole process typically takes about five minutes. Fraser then sent us a link to an FBI fact sheet about the NICS system, which claims that a ""response is typically provided within 30 seconds."" Swinehart said 30 seconds is typical for him when the buyer has a clean record. Although the local firearms dealers are required to keep the form on file, federal authorities are required to delete the personal details received during each NICS inquiry once the sale is approved. If a buyer wants to purchase another gun the next day, the would-be purchaser has to go through the process all over again. In addition to the federal check, local police are required to run a check as well, which can take a few days. It's all part of the state's seven-day waiting period. Our ruling James Langevin said in a news release that passing a federal firearms ""background check through the NICS database . . . typically takes 90 seconds."" Gun dealers tell us the federal process is, in fact, usually very quick, barring some ambiguity with a person's record. However, some readers might take Langevin's statement to mean that the whole process takes 90 seconds. It actually requires a few minutes for the customer to fill out the paperwork and the dealer to transmit the information to the NICS system",Mostly True,"December 8, 2013"
"The ""priorities"" of more than three-quarters of Americans are to increase the minimum wage, create a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants, and require background checks for gun buyers.","Liberals like to claim that Republican policies are out of step with the views of most Americans. The Rev. Al Sharpton drew on some polling results to argue that point on his MSNBC show Politics Nation. Sharpton teed up his attack with an excerpt from a floor speech by House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. Boehner: House Republicans are listening. The Senate, the president continue to stand in the way of the people's priorities. Sharpton: The people's priorities? Let's take a look at some of those priorities. 76 percent want an increase in the minimum wage. How about focusing on that? 77 percent want a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants. There's a priority you should focus on. And nearly one year after the Newtown tragedy, 89 percent support background checks. We see two facets to Sharpton’s claim. First, do better than three-quarters of Americans support a higher minimum wage, a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants and enhanced background checks for gun-buyers? And second, are these ""the people’s priorities""? On the first question, Sharpton largely has it right. For starters, he’s correct about how the congressional GOP’s stance contrasts with that of Americans as a whole. Republicans, with some help from a few Democrats, stymied a Senate bill to require background checks for sales at gun shows and over the web. Most congressional Republicans oppose raising the minimum wage. The idea of a path to citizenship divides the party, but opposition to it is significant and passionate. And Sharpton also has pretty good support for the notion that three-quarters of Americans back each of the three policy positions he cited. Sharpton had a graphic with the poll results and at the bottom were the sources: Quinnipiac University, Gallup and CBS. We reached out to MSNBC to get the specific polls they used but did not hear back. Here is what our research turned up. Sharpton’s claim Quinnipiac Gallup CBS 76% increase minimum wage NA 76% 69% 77% path to citizenship 57% 87% 77% 89% gun buyer background checks 89% 83% 88%   By and large, the polls Sharpton cited back up his claim. On raising the minimum wage and background checks, he chose the highest percentage, but certainly with the latter, all of the results are in the same range. On the matter of citizenship for illegal immigrants, he chose the middle value. There was some variation in the way the polls asked their questions. On the minimum wage, Gallup asked about raising it to $9 an hour, while CBS simply asked if it should be raised and gave no dollar amount. On a pathway to citizenship, Quinnipiac was the outlier because it didn’t include the details of paying fines, waiting 10 years and other conditions before citizenship would be possible. (We’ll get into why that matters below.) On gun background checks, all three asked pretty much the same question. We also looked at other polls to see if they were in line with the ones Sharpton used. The results were mixed, possibly because some polls worded the question differently. We’ve marked those with an asterisk.   Claim NBC/WSJ Pew Bloomberg ABC/WP 76% increase minimum wage 58%* 70% 77% path to citizenship 65%* 74% * 58%* 89% gun buyer background checks 81% 67% *   What we glean from these polls is that support for raising the minimum wage might not be as strong as Sharpton said, but a healthy chunk of the public is behind it. The question on the NBC/Wall Street Journal survey was relatively complex. Pollsters asked people to assess whether they thought increasing it would be good because it would reduce poverty and spur growth, or bad because it would hurt small businesses and make it harder for low-skilled people to find jobs. That definitely was not as simple as asking whether the minimum wage should go up to $9 an hour, as most of the other polls did. Looking at background checks for gun buyers, we again see broad support. The ABC/Washington Post asked people what they thought about the Senate’s failure to pass a background check bill, a change that makes the responses more difficult to compare. Immigration is the thorniest topic and here’s where how the question was asked seemed to make a big difference. Both Bloomberg and NBC/Wall Street Journal put the question two ways. When they simply asked if people supported a pathway to citizenship, support stood at 46 percent in the Bloomberg poll and 52 percent in the NBC/Wall Street Journal survey. When they added details about applicants paying fines, passing a criminal background check and waiting 10 years, opinions sharply spiked towards approval. With the Bloomberg poll, support jumped to 74 percent. In the other, it went to 65 percent. Adding those policy details matches the question to the language in the Senate immigration bill. Where Sharpton’s summary fails to capture an important dimension is on the second part of our inquiry -- do these positions represent the public’s ""priorities""? The reality is that these polls test the public views one issue at a time, and they don’t tell us where voters rank those issues in importance compared to other issues. There is a poll that tackles that question head on. The Pew Research Center for People and the Press has been looking at public’s policy priorities since 1994. The latest findings, from January 2013, show a very different picture than what Sharpton presents. Out of 21 issues, strengthening gun laws and dealing with illegal immigration rank near the bottom at 19 and 18 respectively. Pollsters didn’t ask specifically about the minimum wage. However, improving the job situation ranked second and helping the poor and the needy ranked ninth. It’s possible that raising the minimum wage would fit into those issues but the poll is otherwise silent on this point. Our ruling Sharpton said the ""priorities"" of more than three-quarters of Americans are to increase the minimum wage, create a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants, and require background checks for gun buyers. Polling generally backs up his claim about how Americans view those three issues, though there’s some variation in the polls, often depending on how the question is worded. However, it does not seem that these issues are ""priorities"" for the American public, as Sharpton claimed. In fact, he used the word three times in the space of a few sentences. So we give that part of the claim significant weight",Mostly False,"December 6, 2013"
"""The nine-day deer hunt contributes more than $1.3 billion in revenue to the state of Wisconsin.""","A physicist, an engineer and a statistician are out hunting. Suddenly, a deer appears 50 yards away. The physicist does some ballistic calculations, assuming a vacuum, lifts his rifle to a specific angle, and shoots. The bullet lands 5 yards short. The engineer adds a fudge factor for air resistance, lifts his rifle slightly higher, and shoots. The bullet lands 5 yards long. The statistician yells ""We got him!"" PolitiFact Wisconsin couldn’t help but recall that chestnut as we started fact-checking a claim by Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester). ""FYI,"" Vos posted on Facebook Nov. 22, 2013, the eve of Wisconsin’s biggest hunting season, ""the nine-day deer hunt contributes more than $1.3 billion in revenue to the state of Wisconsin."" Did Vos bag one when describing the impact of 615,000 hunters taking to the woods? At least one of our readers heard the claim as a reference to how much state government pulls in from the hunt. That’s a much smaller figure: Deer hunting licenses and permits generated $22.7 million in revenue for the DNR in 2010, the latest year available. Vos spokeswoman Kit Beyer told us he meant the broader impact on the economy of hunting-related spending. That’s how we read it, too. The same number was referred to by Gov. Scott Walker and others in their own pre-hunt statements. Walker’s news release cited the state Department of Natural Resources, which pointed to a 2006 study, ""Hunting in America,"" by the Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies. That 2006 study estimated direct spending by deer hunters at $899 million. That means money spent on gas for the pickup truck, food and beverages, firearms, ammo, lodging and other essentials, say, a new trailer, a gun case, land access fees, etc. The figure, gleaned from a large national survey conducted by the US Census Bureau, reflects that direct spending by hunters. But the study also estimates the ""ripple effect"" of their spending on the broader economy. That’s the $1.39 billion, cited by Vos and the others. The study uses a pretty broad definition of ripple effect. It quantifies such indirect spending ""as retailers buy more merchandise from wholesalers and manufacturers who then buy more input, plus the spending by the employees of all these companies,"" said Rob Southwick of Southwick Associates, which does the estimate. ""It is possible to divide and track retail sales as they move through the economy, with each successive round becoming smaller until it’s no longer possible to measure."" So it’s a much softer estimate than the direct spending. Such measures always are. It’s worth noting that $1.39 billion figure includes more than the just-concluded nine-day gun hunt mentioned by Vos. There’s a separate bow-hunt season as well. It’s not possible to tease out exactly how much spending is for bow vs. gun, and there is some overlap. But based strictly on licenses for all kinds of deer hunting, 74 percent are for the gun season (615,000 licenses). Applying that ratio, the direct spending for the nine-day gun season would be $665 million, and about $1.03 billion for indirect. That’s lower than Vos said. But because the figure is old, we thought it made sense to apply a simple inflation calculation to the gun deer-hunting numbers we extrapolated from the study’s overall deer hunting figures. The overall impact, including ""ripple effect"" spending, would be about $1.2 billion -- but given the overlap with spending between gun and bow hunting for deer -- probably somewhat higher. Newer numbers We found a study that updates the 2006 calculation. The 2011 report was by the National Shooting Sports Foundation in partnership with the Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies. The NSSF is is the trade association for the firearms industry. That 2011 study showed a surge in the number of deer hunters in Wisconsin, and a 146 percent jump in direct and indirect spending, up to $3.4 billion from the earlier $1.39 billion. Similarly, the direct spending by hunters rose from $899 million to $2.17 billion. The study is more recent, and shows a bigger impact, so you might expect the political types to latch onto it, right? Not in this case, due to concerns raised by a Wisconsin DNR official who urged elected officials to use the more conservative figures. The 2011 study showed a big increase in Wisconsin deer hunters when the number of hunters  actually went down, based on the number of licenses sold, said Keith Warnke, hunting and shooting sports coordinator at DNR. What’s more, Warnke said, it defies logic that spending by hunters more than doubled during the Great Recession. The 2006 direct spending breaks down to $1,400 per hunter -- a reasonable estimate in Warnke’s view. But the 2011 number works out to double that, about $2,800. As it turns out, even one of the authors of the 2011 study doesn’t stand by the big reported hike in the Wisconsin spending numbers. The Wisconsin sample size was too small in the national survey conducted for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, said Southwick. ""The 2011 results should be used cautiously. While at the national level the sample is fine, it is screwy for many states like WI,"" Southwick wrote in an email. So that leaves us with the 2006 numbers. Our rating Vos repeated Walker’s assertion that ""The nine-day deer hunt contributes more than $1.3 billion in revenue to the state of Wisconsin."" The figure is from the most-recent estimate of deer hunting’s economic impact. Vos misfires a bit because the figure actually applies to all deer hunting, not just the gun season. But it’s hard to say by how much, and accounting for inflation brings his claim in line. The statement needs clarification because he’s talking about more than just direct spending by hunters",Mostly True,"December 4, 2013"
"""Back door gun control is in full effect in the United States"" due to ""Obama’s Environmental Protection Agency.""","Former Congressman Allen West has taken aim at a surprising gun control villain: the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. ""It seems that back door gun control is in full effect in the United States. Why? Thanks to Obama’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), we can no longer smelt lead from ore in the United States. ...,"" wrote the Republican and retired Army lieutenant colonel on his website Dec. 1. ""So America, back door gun control is moving forward and while we are all distracted with Obamacare and Iran nuclear negotiations, our Second Amendment rights are undergoing an assault by clandestine infiltration."" Here’s West’s explanation in a nutshell: The Doe Run lead smelter in Herculaneum, Missouri will close its doors this month due to air quality restrictions. ""What this all means,"" West wrote, ""is that after December 2013, any ammunition that will be available to US citizens will have to be imported, which will surely increase the price and possibly come under government control."" Is West correct to conclude that the EPA’s actions are ""back door gun control""? A reader asked us to check West’s claim, so we did. (A hat tip to the Blaze, which published its own fact-check between the time we spotted West’s claim and the time we published it.) Lead’s dangers Lead is a serious health hazard. According to the Mayo Clinic, ""even small amounts of lead can cause serious health problems. Children under the age of 6 are especially vulnerable to lead poisoning, which can severely affect mental and physical development. At very high levels, lead poisoning can be fatal."" Lead contamination can be found in air, water and soil as well as homes from old paint. Lead-based paint and lead-contaminated dust in older buildings are the most common sources of lead poisoning in children. Adults who work with batteries, home renovations or in auto repair shops also may be exposed to lead. The health dangers prompted the U.S. to phase out leaded gasoline in the 1980s. As Doe Run announced at the time, the company reached a settlement with the EPA and the state of Missouri in 2010 which included paying fines and ceasing smelting operations in Herculaneum. But the news is gaining fresh attention now because the actual closure date of Dec. 31 is looming. West’s blog cited an Oct. 29 post by Terresa Monroe-Hamilton on noisyroom.net which slammed the feds for ""back door gun control"" in driving the plant to closure. (The Blaze reported that West’s initial post failed to cite noisyroom but later updated with attribution.) Monroe-Hamilton sent us to a post she wrote Dec. 3 in response to the controversy, in which she said what she wrote was an ""opinion piece."" But the long history of lead-control efforts casts serious doubt on the idea that the closure was driven by anti-gun concerns. Ever since the EPA was created in 1970, one of its missions has been to limit pollution from smelters which are ""terribly toxic sites,"" said David Rosner, a professor of sociomedical sciences at Columbia University who studies the politics of pollution. The Doe Run smelter, he says, was shut down because it was a major polluter -- not as a way of curbing guns. ""It had nothing to do with gun control or bullets,"" Rosner told PolitiFact. ""The idea of linking this to an issue of gun control or a surreptitious way for the government trying to shut down the gun industry is nuts. This was an EPA decision because of children who were being poisoned by what had come out of that plant."" While West, who represented South Florida for one term, pointed the finger at ""Obama’s"" EPA, the EPA’s case against Doe Run actually began decades ago. The St. Louis area failed to meet federal clean air standards for lead in 1987 -- during the Reagan administration -- due to emissions from the smelter, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported in 1989. Reagan wasn't the only Republican president to advance the anti-lead effort. In 2008, under President George W. Bush, the EPA adopted tougher air quality standards for lead that were 10 times more stringent than the past. In 2010, the EPA reached a settlement with Doe Run. In November, Doe Run issued a news release about the closure: ""Although the United States is home to a number of secondary lead smelters, which recycle lead from various sources, the Herculaneum facility is the last primary lead smelter in the United States,"" according to the release. The release explains that the company isn’t shutting down entirely. While the company is closing its primary smelter, which extracts lead from ore, it will continue to operate as a secondary lead smelter -- essentially a recycler for lead contained in other products. According to the company, more than 80 percent of all lead produced in the United States is used in either vehicle batteries or in stationary batteries for backup power used by the military and in telecommunications and medical applications.""In the U.S., the recycle rate of these batteries is approximately 98 percent, making lead-based batteries the most highly recycled consumer product,"" the company release said. ""These batteries are recycled at secondary lead smelters. We own such a smelter in southern Missouri."" The company added that lead is used in ammunition and other materials. Doe Run spokeswoman Tammy Stankey emailed PolitiFact to say that the company ""will continue to supply our ammo customers using secondary lead."" We interviewed experts on lead or ammunition to ask about the impact of the plant closure. Most said there should not be major concerns. Michael Bazinet, a spokesman for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, confirmed that lead used for ammunition made in the U.S. comes almost exclusively from recycled sources. ""While no one should ever be pleased about the closure of any industry, in this case there should not be a noticeable effect on consumers.  ... We should not see any effect on the civilian marketplace,"" Bazinet told PolitiFact. The foundation’s general counsel, Lawrence Keane, echoed that view in an interview with the Washington Times Others agree. While Doe Run is the last ""primary"" lead smelter in the U.S. there are plenty of ""secondary"" processing of lead in the U.S., Richard Lowden, a research engineer at the U.S. Department of Energy Oak Ridge National Laboratory told PolitiFact in an email. ""Primary lead is of higher purity and is needed for specialty applications such as unique types of lead-acid batteries,"" Lowden said. ""Secondary lead is slightly less pure and is used in most applications -- over 80 percent of domestic consumption, including bullets. The U.S. imports very little lead, with the main foreign sources being Canada and Mexico. I do not  believe shooters have to worry about a source of lead for bullets."" Florida Bullet, a Clearwater-based company that supplies ammunition to most law enforcement agencies in Florida, isn’t worried about the smelter’s closure. The bullets the company sells, made by Federal and Speer, ""use reclaimed lead, so this is not going to bother us as far as production goes,"" said the company’s president, Tom Falone. ""We don’t foresee this being a problem for us."" When we asked Michele Hickford, West’s spokeswoman, why he blamed Obama if the EPA had zeroed in on the smelter long before Obama was president, she said, ""The plant closed under Obama. Regardless of what this lead plant is used for, the EPA net is tightening on the entire industry, and if you follow it to its logical conclusion, the industry will be shut down eventually. This is yet another example of the Obama administration circumventing the legislative process to achieve its goals."" Our ruling West wrote that ""back door gun control is in full effect in the United States"" due ""to Obama’s Environmental Protection Agency."" But there is no evidence that it was a clandestine effort at back door gun control. Rather, the EPA’s settlement with Doe Run -- which concluded a case that began years before Obama was elected president -- had to do with emissions of a chemical that can cause serious injury and death to adults and children. And ammunition experts shot massive holes in the notion that the smelter’s closure would cut production, reduce supply or raise the cost of ammunition",False Pants on Fire,"December 3, 2013"
"""Firearms homicides are down about 40 percent"" since Texas passed concealed-gun permit law.","An online campaign video from Texas Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson, one of the Republican hopefuls in the 2014 lieutenant governor race, touts his record on defending Second Amendment rights. ""I stood alone in passing the Texas concealed-handgun law over the doomsday predictions of blood in the streets, ‘Wild Wild West’ and shootouts at every four-way stop,"" Patterson says, ""and of course none of that happened. Matter of fact, firearms homicides are down about 40 percent."" As a state senator from Pasadena, Patterson wrote the 1995 legislation that allowed eligible Texans to get licenses to carry concealed handguns, which was approved overwhelmingly after much debate by a Senate vote of 23-7 and a House vote of 101-46. In news stories from the 1995 regular legislative session, Austin Democratic Rep. Sherri Greenberg predicted gunplay in hospital emergency rooms and Dallas lawmakers said frustrated drivers would shoot each other in traffic. A March 16, 1995, Houston Chronicle news story quoted then-Sen. Greg Luna, D-San Antonio, as saying, ""It is going to be a much more dangerous and deadly society we have imposed on ourselves in Texas."" Did firearms murders subsequently decrease by 40 percent? By phone, Patterson told us he used national data on firearms homicides rates per 100,000 people since 1993 because he didn’t have state statistics. Nationwide figures were still relevant, he said, ""because over the last 20 years, dozens of states have added concealed-handgun (licensing) laws that didn’t have them before."" Patterson campaign spokesman Chris Elam emailed us web links to reports published in May 2013 from the Pew Research Center and the U.S. Bureau of Justics Statistics  showing that in recent years, the rate of firearms homicides nationwide had fallen by 49 percent from a historic peak in 1993. But the Texas law took effect in 1996. Wouldn’t that year be the logical starting point for judging changes in deaths by firearms? Defending his claim, Patterson told us by phone that he used 1993 as a starting point because that was the year when lawmakers initially advanced his proposal, which Gov. Ann Richards vetoed. During this fact-check, he said, he ""recognized the flaw in me saying 1993 when it actually didn’t come into effect until 1 January 1996, but I think the message,"" that murders did not spike, ""is still accurate."" Next, we looked for data on Texas gun murders since 1996. From the CDC, we found reports online covering 1996-2010, drawn from death certificate information reported by medical professionals and coroners, and we got 1996-2012 data from the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reports, most recently updated Sept. 16, 2013, with information on murders and other crimes known to law enforcement agencies. By the CDC tally, the rate of firearms homicides in Texas 1996-2010 fell 32.2 percent. Calculating with the FBI data for 1996-2012, the rate fell 42 percent. The U.S. and Texas declines in gun homicides are part of a larger trend -- U.S. violent crimes overall began falling significantly in the 1990s. Crime experts have advanced reasons including a decrease in crack cocaine use, economic factors, tougher police strategies and the aging of the baby-boom generation. Patterson said he does not claim that concealed-handgun laws reduce crime -- rather, he said, he is stating such statutes don’t increase crime, ""in spite of the protestations to the contrary."" Our ruling Patterson said firearms homicides decreased 40 percent since Texas passed a law permitting licensed residents to carry concealed guns. That claim was staked to changes nationally and a timeframe unreasonably starting before the law took effect. Still, Patterson’s figure is close to correct. Data for Texas show declines of either 32 percent or 42 percent since the state law took effect. We are not concluding that the measure authored by Patterson explains the decrease, which occurred nationally for multiple reasons",Mostly True,"November 27, 2013"
"""Florida sheriffs unequivocally support"" the ""stand your ground"" law.","Florida’s ""stand your ground"" law has been controversial both statewide and nationally since the 2012 shooting death of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teenager. But Florida legislators show no sign of backing away from it. The Florida House Criminal Justice Subcommittee rejected a repeal of the law during a five-hour meeting Nov. 7, 2013. The hearing was led by Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fort Walton Beach, who had previously vowed not to change ""one damn comma"" of the law. At the hearing, supporters and critics lined up to speak about the law. Among the supporters are sheriffs, said Okaloosa County Sheriff Larry Ashley. ""Florida sheriffs unequivocally support this, the right to stand your ground,"" said the sheriff from northwest Florida. Ashley said that the ""stand your ground"" law expanded the ""castle doctrine"" -- the right for people to defend themselves at home -- to other places, including their neighborhood and the mall. ""Florida sheriffs stand behind this law and oppose the repeal of it,"" said Ashley, who served on the task force formed by Gov. Rick Scott to examine the law after Trayon's death. The dictionary defines ""unequivocal"" as ""admitting of no doubt or misunderstanding; clear and unambiguous."" Ashley’s statement could leave listeners with the impression that Florida sheriffs’ have no doubts about the stand your ground law. Is that correct? Sheriffs association vote on ‘stand your ground’ The ""stand your ground"" law, which was approved overwhelmingly by the Legislature and signed by Gov. Jeb Bush in 2005, allows people to use deadly force when they believe their life is at risk. Trayvon, of Miami Gardens, was shot in Sanford on Feb. 26, 2012, by George Zimmerman, a white-Hispanic neighborhood watchman. The ""stand your ground"" law was cited in the jury instructions, and in July 2013, the jury found Zimmerman not guilty of second-degree murder. The law became a touchstone in the debate about Trayvon's death. About a month after the acquittal, the Florida Sheriffs Association issued a press release expressing support for the law. ""The right to self-defense is well-established in law,"" stated the Aug. 9 press release. ""The Florida Sheriffs confirmed this position by voting unanimously, at the 2013 Florida Sheriffs Association Summer Conference, to support the 'stand your ground' law as it is currently written. Our current judicial system is comprised of multiple checks and balances to ensure fair and equitable application of all laws, including 'stand your ground.' "" Ashley, who participated in the vote, told PolitiFact Florida that none of the sheriffs voiced opposition to the law during the association’s meeting at Marco Island in August. ""As with any issue you can only measure support or opposition to a position when it is voiced at the time of its measurement,"" Ashley told PolitiFact Florida in an email. But some news reports about the association’s announcement questioned whether it was accurate to describe the vote as ""unanimous."" For starters, it was unclear how many sheriffs voted. The association reported that 57 of its 66 sheriffs registered for the conference, but the association didn’t record the number who participated in the vote -- some may have left before the vote or didn’t participate in it. ""It was a large number of sheriffs,"" Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd, the association president, told PolitiFact Florida. ""I can’t tell you if it was 57, 52, 55. It is a well-attended session because that’s where we discuss things among ourselves that are of some importance."" News reports indicated that some sheriffs -- including from large urban counties including Broward, Hillsborough and Orange -- didn’t participate in the vote and that a few sheriffs had some reservations about the law. Judd told PolitiFact that there was no written agenda that notified sheriffs ahead of time that they would take a vote on the ""stand your ground"" law. Judd said that sheriffs had heard that House Speaker Will Weatherford wanted input from law enforcement about the law, and that that’s what prompted the vote. Judd couldn’t recall for certain if he was the sheriff who brought up the topic, but he added that it might have been him. (Judd was elevated to the group’s presidency during the conference.) There was no written motion about the vote, but Judd said the wording was essentially: ""Do you support Florida’s 'stand your ground' law?"" ""It was a unanimous vote and there was not a voice in opposition,"" Judd said. Judd said he was frustrated that news reports questioned his description of the vote as ""unanimous."" ""Some reporters say ‘you didn’t have 100 percent of Florida sheriffs.’ You are missing the issue. We had 100 percent vote of the ones in the room that voted. ... It’s kind of like election day -- you don’t show up and vote, your vote doesn’t count."" Judd said the association’s vote doesn’t stop any individual sheriffs from advocating for their personal views about the law. Sheriffs could weigh in again at their conference in February shortly before the legislative session. Some sheriffs have raised concerns about the law The vote is one thing; subsequent comments by sheriffs are another. We found news reports about seven sheriffs, a mix of Democrats and Republicans, who either raised concerns about the law or whose position about the law was unclear. In some cases, these sheriffs didn’t participate in the association’s vote. PolitiFact Florida contacted spokespersons for those sheriffs. Here’s a summary of our findings: Broward County: The Sun-Sentinel reported that Sheriff Scott Israel wasn’t at the Florida Sheriffs Association conference due to National Night Out events in Broward. Israel told the Sentinel in August that had he attended, ""I would have voted against the FSA statement on the 'stand your ground' law. I support an individual's right to use armed self-defense when faced with the immediate threat of death or serious bodily injury, and without requiring any duty to retreat in one's own home. However, if there is a safe opportunity in other settings to retreat and de-escalate potentially deadly violence, it should be done. For this reason, I support legislative changes to more narrowly restrict the use of the 'stand your ground' defense."" Israel expressed support for ""fixing serious flaws"" in the law in an October op-ed in the Sun-Sentinel. Pinellas County: Sheriff Bob Gualtieri told PolitiFact Florida in an email, ""I was unclear as to exactly what was being asked in the motion,"" at the association meeting. ""I did not verbalize a response when the voice vote was called."" Gualtieri said that he ""unequivocally"" supports the broad concept of the ""stand your ground"" law. However, he said there is room for discussion about some adjustments. ""I do not support the application of SYG immunity in circumstances where the person against whom deadly force was used was totally unarmed with any type of weapon when the force was used,"" Gualtieri said. ""I also do not believe that someone deemed to be a 'primary aggressor' should be able to assert SYG — one does not get to pick the fight and then end it with deadly force."" Hillsborough: The Tampa Tribune reported that Sheriff David Gee attended the conference but left before the vote. (We confirmed that directly with a spokeswoman.) He said he ""wouldn't have voted that way without hearing the state attorneys out on that issue.""   In July 2012, Gee sent a response to an NRA questionnaire in which he declined to provide his personal opinion about self defense. ""The Legislature has spoken on this issue,"" he wrote. ""HCSO deputies always follow the law."" Orange: A spokesman for Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings told PolitiFact Florida that Demings attended the meeting but had to leave early to attend National Night Out events. The spokesman sent us a previous statement by Demings: ""Had I been present, I likely would not have supported the vote. As a member of the Citizen Safety and Protection Task Force appointed by Governor Scott last year, I stand by the recommendations of the Task Force."" Volusia and Flagler counties: The News Service of Florida reported that the sheriffs in Volusia and Flagler counties expressed reservations about the law. A spokesman for Volusia Sheriff Ben Johnson told PolitiFact Florida in an email that Johnson was in the room for the vote but did not participate in it. Johnson, a past president of the association, stands behind the association’s position on the law, but added that ""his personal position differs slightly from that of the association. The sheriff supports the right of citizens to employ deadly force with no duty to retreat in order to defend themselves while in their homes or vehicles. However, when out in the open and facing a threat, the sheriff believes citizens should attempt to retreat if possible before using lethal force. He has consistently stated this position and supports the law, but believes it would be improved with the addition of three words (retreat if possible) as it relates to locations other than homes or vehicles."" Meanwhile, Flagler County Sheriff Jim Manfre, according to the News Service of Florida, ""said the association's take doesn't exactly match his personal view. Manfre said he thinks the castle doctrine should remain on the books and the rest be repealed."" (Manfre had no additional comment for PolitiFact Florida, his spokesman said.) Miami-Dade: Miami-Dade is the most populous county in the state and home to Trayvon, but J.D. Patterson -- the county’s appointed police director, the equivalent of an elected sheriff -- does not appear to have commented publicly about ""stand your ground."" According to Huffington Post, a spokesperson for Patterson confirmed that he attended the conference but couldn’t say if he voted. ""Director J.D. Patterson was there and he does not wish to discuss the issue,"" Det. Alvaro Zabaleta told PolitiFact Florida in an email. Our ruling During a legislative hearing about Florida’s controversial ""stand your ground"" law, Okaloosa Sheriff Larry Ashley said ""Florida sheriffs unequivocally support this, the right to 'stand your ground.' "" The Florida Sheriffs Association did take a voice vote in August that the association reported was unanimous in support of the current ""stand your ground"" law. But no more than 57 of the state’s 66 sheriffs voted (and quite likely fewer) and a number of sheriffs, including those representing some of the state’s most populous counties, have spoken publicly or to PolitiFact Florida about their reservations about the law. Ashley’s comments left readers with the impression that the support among Florida is ""unequivocal,"" or unambiguous, but that’s not the case",Mostly False,"November 15, 2013"
"""Under President (George W.) Bush, prosecution of gun crimes was 30 percent higher than it is under President Obama.""","After leading the charge for a government shutdown to defund President Barack Obama’s health care law, freshman Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, hasn’t shied away from the spotlight. On Nov. 8, 2013, Cruz was a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. Long before he got to the obligatory joke about reading Green Eggs & Ham during a lengthy Senate speech, he addressed gun policy. ""Do you target violent criminals, or do you try to take away the constitutional rights of law-abiding citizens?"" Cruz said. After the senator criticized Obama for focusing on the latter at the expense of the former, he praised predecessor George W. Bush’s efforts. ""Under President Bush, prosecution of gun crimes was 30 percent higher than it is under President Obama,"" Cruz said. ""They’re not targeting bad guys."" We decided to see how the numbers differed under the two presidents. Ways to read the data Let’s break down the number of federal prosecutions by year. We’ll start with fiscal year 2002, since that represents Bush’s first full year in office. Fiscal year 2012 is the most recent year we have data for. There are two different sets of statistics we can look at. Cruz’s spokeswoman referred us to the Transitional Records Access Clearinghouse, a Syracuse University data-gathering organization. This data tracks federal gun prosecutions by the lead, or most serious, charge. On the other hand, the Department of Justice’s United States Attorney’s Office tracks all charges, a more inclusive category of prosecutions. Their data set includes everyone who was charged with a gun crime. The lead charge category only includes people whose most serious offense was gun-related, a distinction that omits thousands of charges each year. Cruz’s spokeswoman also told us that Cruz’s claim didn’t take into account numbers for Bush’s entire term: He used 2004, the high-water mark for lead gun prosecutions during the time period, as his starting point. We’re left with four ways to calculate the percent change: • Lead charges from 2002 to 2012, which gives us a 2.2 percent decrease • Lead charges from 2004 to 2012, which gives us a 29.4 percent decrease • All charges from 2002 to 2012, which gives us a 10.3 percent increase • All charges from 2005 (the high-water mark of this data set) to 2012, which gives us a 10.2 percent decrease This makes clear how Cruz got his 30 percent decrease. However, that’s not the only, or necessarily the best, approach. None other than TRAC’s co-director, Susan Long, told PolitiFact that her organization’s use of lead charges isn’t as comprehensive as using all charges. She also called Cruz’s 2004 start date misleading, since it amounts to cherry-picking. The most reliable number may be the 10.3 percent increase in gun prosecutions between fiscal years 2002 and 2012. This rate actually indicates the trend moving in the opposite direction from what Cruz asserted. Who’s responsible? In addition to highlighting a numerical difference in federal gun crime prosecutions, Cruz specifically suggested that Obama’s policies are responsible for the decrease. But how much influence does the president really have on the issue? Experts say: not much. ""The Bush administration was all over the map,"" Long said. ""Those trends really are being driven by something other than presidential policy,"" since the peaks and valleys don’t coincide with presidential terms, she said. As we’ve noted in a previous fact check, the president, as the head of the executive branch, can order changes to prosecutorial priorities. For instance, following the Newtown, Conn. school shooting in December 2012, Obama did call for the need to ""maximize enforcement efforts to prevent gun violence and prosecute gun crime."" We don’t yet have data that reflects prosecutions in the aftermath of Newtown. But it’s important to note that Obama’s priorities are not the only factors at play in these decisions. Any presidential shift in policy must filter down to the attorney general, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives field offices, and front-line attorneys, said Ronald Frandsen, grants administrator for the Regional Justice Information Service. U.S. attorneys can decline to prosecute gun cases for a variety of reasons, as outlined by TRAC. So Obama is responsible for setting the broad policy approach to gun prosecutions, but he isn’t micromanaging individual cases. Much of the decision-making occurs at a lower level. Our ruling Cruz said prosecution of gun crimes under the Bush administration was 30 percent higher than it is under Obama. It’s possible to get a decline that big by cherry-picking the data, but the most inclusive method actually produces an increase. Cruz also overstates the role of the president in determining prosecution rates",Mostly False,"November 15, 2013"
"Says the Obama administration is handing out a pamphlet titled, ""What To Do When The Veteran In Your Classroom Attempts A Mass Shooting""","On Nov. 12, 2013, a blog called Mr. Conservative posted an alarming headline -- especially so given that it was just one day after the Veterans’ Day holiday. The story, which was forwarded to us by a reader, was headlined: ""Obama Admin. Hands Out Pamphlet: 'What To Do When The Veteran In Your Classroom Attempts A Mass Shooting.'"" The story went on to say that ""veterans all across the country are upset"" with the Education Department-issued pamphlet. Veterans, the site said, ""are taking the stance that this makes it look like ‘all veterans are PTSD-crazed cauldrons of rage.’ "" The Education Department’s defense, according to the post, was that there were already other pamphlets ""like ‘What To Do When The Hispanic In Your Classroom Attempts A Mass Shooting,’ ‘What To Do When The Gay Student In Your Classroom Attempts A Mass Shooting,’ and ‘What To Do When The Special-Needs Child In Your Classroom Attempts A Mass Shooting.’"" The article quoted an unnamed representative of the Veterans of Foreign Wars calling the pamphlets ""incredibly frustrating"" and saying they offered ""several asinine recommendations."" Was the story true? A lot of people seemed to think so. A number of blogs and other social media sites referenced or reposted it, and commenters on Mr. Conservative appeared to take it seriously. ""I am ashamed that we are demeaning my fellow veterans in this manner. It seems to be part of Obama's grand scheme to diminish the military,"" said one. Said another, ""What is it going to take to get this guy impeached??? If he doesn't get impeached, nobody will."" Other commenters called Obama a ""disgusting pig"" or worse. But a few Mr. Conservative commenters wondered whether it was a spoof, and it turns out that they were on to something. It was actually a piece of satire -- one that Mr. Conservative posted without labeling it as such. Though Mr. Conservative didn’t cite the original source or link to it, some quick Googling enabled us to find the source easily -- a website called the Duffel Blog, which is a satire site aimed at members of the military. Here’s the disclaimer posted on the Duffel Blog’s ""About"" page: ""We are in no way, shape, or form, a real news outlet. Everything on this website is satirical and the content of this site is a parody of a news organization.

Indeed, a cursory glance at the Duffel Blog front page on Nov. 12 suggests that a visitor probably would have been able to figure that out on their own. The headlines included, ""Pentagon Proposes New Antarctica Command,"" ""Applebee’s Declares Bankruptcy After Offering Free Alcohol For Veterans Day,"" and ""Paperwork Error Sends Marines To Guard Streets Of Hell"" (the last one was datelined, ""The Pearly Gates of Heaven""). Just to be sure, we also asked the Education Department, and a spokesman said the pamphlet ""is obviously not ours."" An inquiry sent through Mr. Conservative’s website was not answered, and as of publication time, the site had neither taken down the story nor labeled it as satire.  The Duffel Blog’s founder, former Marine Sgt. Paul Szoldra, did not respond to a request, but in 2012, he told Columbia Journalism Review, ""I think you have to have a dark sense of humor just to survive. ""It’s a way of coping with things beyond your control.

Our ruling The website Mr. Conservative posted an article that claimed the Obama administration was handing out a pamphlet titled, ""What To Do When The Veteran In Your Classroom Attempts A Mass Shooting.""

"Wendy Davis is ""fighting to bring ... Bloomberg-style gun control to Texas.""","Austin political consultant Steven Rivas drew our attention to a claim on a donation web page for Greg Abbott’s gubernatorial campaign saying state Sen. Wendy Davis is ""fighting to bring California values to Texas"" including ""Bloomberg-style gun control."" Setting aside how much California agrees with New York’s gun-control advocate mayor Michael Bloomberg, we thought Texans would want to know Davis’ views, as her bid to become governor is the first statewide campaign for the Fort Worth Democrat. Davis hasn’t, so far, focused on gun control in her campaign. Abbott, a Republican who’s served as Texas’ attorney general since 2002, says on his campaign site that he’ll fight federal limits on gun rights. Abbott campaign spokesmen Matt Hirsch and Avdiel Huerta told us by email that Davis, a former Fort Worth City Council member elected to the Senate in 2008, had ""voted twice against campus carry,"" ""voted to prohibit gun shows in Fort Worth,"" supported background checks for gun buyers and had opposed a measure to remove cities’ abilities to restrict guns in municipal buildings; they also provided citations and backup materials. Asked for specifics on ""Bloomberg-style,"" Huerta sent a March 26, 2013, PolitiFact fact-check that said, ""Bloomberg is pushing for universal background checks on all firearm purchases."" In addition, Bloomberg, a powerful advocate for gun control both locally and nationally, has long urged and in some cases helped enact measures including strengthening punishments for those who illegally possess guns, registering gun offenders and banning military-style weapons. He also focuses on ""straw"" purchases -- those made by people who intend to re-sell the weapons to illegal buyers -- and has been criticized for his city administration’s sting operations in other states to uncover such transactions. Bloomberg co-founded and co-chairs Mayors Against Illegal Guns, a group that launched a $12 million, 13-state ad campaign March 23, 2013, promoting expanded background checks. Group spokeswoman Erika Soto Lamb told us by email that ""Bloomberg-style"" could fairly be defined as ""common-sense gun reforms that will save American lives by keeping guns out of dangerous hands."" Universal background checks -- requiring private sellers everywhere (not just at gun shows) to run background checks -- are a prime example and the group’s priority, she said.   Davis on gun shows   Hirsch of Abbott’s campaign emailed us citations from news stories saying that as a member of the Fort Worth City Council in 2000, Davis supported making sure all buyers faced background checks at gun shows in city-owned facilities and that she recently told the Texas Tribune she still held that view. A Sept. 11, 2013, Tribune news story Hirsch emailed to us said Davis was a gun owner and quoted her as saying of the gun show restrictions, ""I haven’t pursued it as a senator because I know it’s like spitting in the wind"" and ""But I still believe it’s the right thing. And if I were governor and a bill came to my desk that provided for background checks at gun shows, I would sign that."" Hirsch also cited a Sept. 18, 2013, commentary by Georgia writer Brandon Howell, posted on the conservative Daily Caller website, that went further, saying Davis also ""sought banning gun shows on city-owned property."" A Fort Worth ordinance Davis proposed in 2000 could have barred some gun shows from city property, but was tabled along with a related proposal, according to news stories starting in 2000 about a months-long city government debate on gun control that year. An Aug. 9, 2000, news story in the Dallas Morning News said her ordinance would have placed restrictions on shows ""including provisions that would allow only licensed dealers to sell firearms on city premises."" According to the story, Davis said that another option was requiring background checks on gun buyers at the shows. A July 19, 2000, News story said Davis also supported the other tabled proposal, a resolution by which the council would have asked the federal government to require background checks of gun show buyers. Bloomberg supports background checks on gun show buyers, evidenced notably when he sent New York investigators to gun shows in states as far away as Nevada in 2006, 2009 and 2011 to find evidence that private dealers would sell to buyers who wouldn’t pass background checks. In a July 25, 2012, fact-check, PolitiFact gave a Half True rating to his claim that ""you can sell guns without a background check at a gun show, forty percent of guns are sold that way, same thing on the Internet.""   Davis on campus carry   Legal gun owners’ ability to take their weapons onto college campuses doesn’t appear to be an issue Bloomberg emphasizes, based on our check of the Nexis news archive. Mayors Against Illegal Guns has supported college leaders calling for tighter gun restrictions on campuses nationwide, but doesn’t name the issue among its principles or in the primary categories on its scorecard for lawmakers. New York state bans weapons on campuses. Hirsch, turning to Davis’ tenure as a state senator, cited her 2009 vote against a proposal to allow Texas concealed-handgun license holders to carry handguns on college campuses. That proposal passed the Senate by 20-11 and cleared a House committee, but it died toward the end of the legislative session short of reaching the full House. Hirsch also specified Davis’ 2011 vote on legislation intended to let such license holders carry guns inside campus buildings. Senators including Davis voted 19-11 not to bring the proposal up for floor consideration, and it then died (a similar measure failed to pass in the 2013 session). To our inquiry, Davis campaign spokeswoman Rebecca Acuña told us by email that Davis voted for three pro-gun measures, supported two others and was quoted in a Jan. 13, 2013, Fort Worth Star-Telegram news story as saying, ""Americans have the right under the Second Amendment to own firearms, and that is not going to change."" Acuña said Davis wants to protect Second Amendment rights on firearms ""for honest citizens by assuring that they are kept out of the hands of criminals."" One of the Senate votes Acuña cited was related to campus carry issues. In the 2013 session, Davis was among the ""yea"" votes when the Senate approved, 27-4, a proposal to allow college students with concealed-handgun licenses to store handguns in locked vehicles on campus. The measure became law and took effect Sept. 1, 2013. The Daily Caller item Hirsch provided to us described that as ""an easy vote"" for Davis because the proposal passed by such a wide margin. Davis told the bill’s author, according to an April 30, 2013, Star-Telegram news story, that ""she planned to support his bill but said she wanted his assurance that ‘you will not allow that opening, that broad opening to become a part of what you’re passing out of here today.’ … ‘You understand that there are many of us in the Senate chamber who are concerned about the broader impacts of carrying on campus.’ "" The story said Davis later issued a statement saying that ""it is important that the local control of colleges and universities over their campuses be preserved with regard to carrying guns on campus.""   Davis on concealed-carry measures and cities’ abilities to restrict guns   Bloomberg and his group have long opposed letting states recognize out-of-state concealed-carry permits. New York City, where Bloomberg is nearing the end of his 12-year stretch as mayor, issues concealed-carry permits in limited circumstances. And Bloomberg favors expanding at least some concealed-carry restrictions; after the Feb. 26, 2012, death of Trayvon Martin in Florida, Bloomberg said in an April 11, 2012, speech at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., that George Zimmerman, who shot Martin, should never have been allowed to carry a concealed weapon because of his legal history. Huerta sent us part of a May 24, 2001, Star-Telegram news story in which council members including Davis ""criticized a bill passed by the state Senate that would ... give the Legislature the sole right to regulate whether"" concealed-handgun license holders ""can take their weapons to such locations as city halls, libraries or parks."" The story quoted Davis as saying, ""I think it's a terrible idea"" and ""Once again, it's an example of the state getting involved in an issue that should be within the city's jurisdiction."" Acuña cited Davis’ 2013 votes on three measures simplifying the process to get a concealed-carry license. Davis voted for a proposal to prohibit state officials from requiring applicants’ Social Security numbers that became law and takes effect Jan. 1, 2014, and for two measures that became law effective Sept. 1, 2013, cutting the number of instruction hours needed and eliminating the need to take a proficiency test. The Senate approved the measures by votes of, respectively, 25-6, 29-1 and 27-4. Acuña also noted that Davis voted for a measure allowing the state’s attorney general to get an injunction against a city or county that breaks state law by restricting ownership, transport, licensing or other actions regarding firearms, ammunition and supplies. The Senate approved it 24-6; it became law and took effect June 14, 2013. It’s not a new restriction on cities, but rather a specific way to enable the enforcement of existing state law that bars such local restrictions.   So is Wendy like Mike?   The mayoral group’s spokeswoman named universal background checks as ""Bloomberg-like."" So does the NRA, it turns out. Spokesman Andrew Arulanandam of the NRA’s lobbying arm told us by phone, ""AG Abbott is correct in his assessment,"" based on Bloomberg’s federal-level push for expanding background checks and Davis’ remarks to the Texas Tribune favoring ""background checks at gun shows."" At the Texas State Rifle Association, which is affiliated with the NRA, spokeswoman Alice Tripp told us by phone that she agreed with Abbott based on Davis’ 2000 push for background checks at gun shows. ""Bloomberg seems to attack firearm ownership in that kind of parental way,"" she said. Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, told us by email her group hopes Davis ""will come out in support of common-sense gun reform, including background checks,"" and said that to her group, ""Bloomberg-style gun control"" is not a pejorative term. The groups did not have scorecards or endorsements for specific candidates this far ahead of Texas’ Nov. 4, 2014, general election. Our ruling Abbott said Davis is ""fighting to bring"" ""Bloomberg-style gun control to Texas."" Like Bloomberg, Davis supports background checks for all buyers at gun shows. She has opposed campus-carry measures, but voted to allow concealed weapons locked in vehicles while warning the author not to take it any farther. She has opposed letting the state tell cities or colleges they can’t regulate guns on their property, but voted to let the state pursue injunctions against cities that overstep limitations currently in state law. She joined most of the Senate in voting for three laws simplifying concealed-handgun permit applications. Davis has taken some actions Bloomberg might approve, and others he might not. However, she doesn’t appear, so far, to be ""fighting"" for tighter gun control if elected governor",Half True,"November 8, 2013"
"Virginia is ""the number one state per capita in screening out people with mental illness from gun purchases.""","GOP gubernatorial nominee Ken Cuccinelli says the state has made strides in keeping guns away from the mentally ill since the 2007 mass shooting at Virginia Tech. ""What we’ve done in Virginia is we have become the number one state per capita in screening out people with mental illness from gun purchases,"" Cuccinelli said during a Sept. 25 debate with Democrat Terry McAuliffe. We wondered if Virginia really is No. 1. To support his statement, Cuccinelli campaign spokeswoman Anna Nix pointed to a chart in the Seattle Times that ranked states on that measure.The chart was based on figures compiled by Mayors Against Illegal Guns -- a gun control group started by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Those figures show Virginia had submitted 2,254 mental health records to the national background check system for every 100,000 residents in the state. That was the highest ratio among all states in late 2011. The gun control group said in a November 2011 version of its Fatal Gaps report that Virginia had been sharing records with the national background check database for a decade, but the volume of records shared increased after the 2007 Virginia Tech tragedy. In that case, Seung-Hui Cho, was able to purchase two handguns he used to kill 32 people despite going through federal and state background checks at licensed gun dealers, according to a 2009 panel report on the shooting to then Gov. Tim Kaine. Cho had been deemed a danger to himself by a Virginia court, and that normally would have made him ineligible to buy the weapons. But his information was not shared with the federal National Instant Background Check System, the panel said, because of ambiguities in Virginia’s guns laws. The Virginia Tech shootings sparked a nationwide examination of the national background check system. Congress passed a 2008 law providing incentives for states to submit mental health records to the national background check system, but they are under no requirement comply. Virginia also passed legislation expanding the mental health records that have to be sent to the federal and state background check databases. Mayors Against Illegal Guns notes on its interactive chart that in the wake of the massacre, Virginia became the national leader in submitting mental health records to the national background check system. It remained at the top of the group’s list until October 2012, Erika Soto Lamb, a spokeswoman for Mayors Against Illegal Guns, said in an e-mail. Since, then, however, Pennsylvania has vaulted from the bottom of the pack to the top. That month, according to the Pittsburgh Post Gazette, the Pennsylvania State Police resolved lengthy legal and technical problems and transmitted 643,167 mental health records to the NICS. The submission means that Pennsylvania has submitted about 5,003 mental health records to the national background check system per 100,000 residents. Virginia was a distant No. 2 in the latest report by the mayors’ group, which counts all submissions through Oct. 31, 2012. Virginia had sent 180,338 mental health records to NICS. That breaks down to about 2,220 records per 100,000 residents. Rounding out the Top 5 were Delaware, California and Washington. The Bottom 5, in descending order, were Oklahoma, Louisiana, North Dakota, Rhode Island and Massachusetts. The gun control group plans to issue an updated report in the coming weeks. Our ruling  Cuccinelli said Virginia is ""the number one state per capita in screening out people with mental illness from gun purchases."" His claim is based on outdated numbers.   Virginia used to be No.1, but was surpassed by Pennsylvania last year. Now, we’re a distant No. 2. That’s still impressive. So Cuccinelli’s statement is largely accurate but needs the clarification",Mostly True,"October 7, 2013"
"Says ""Nathan Deal killed pro-gun bills in 2013.""","Gov. Nathan Deal has typically received high marks from gun advocacy groups, so we were surprised by a flier one group put together that accused him of derailing pro-gun legislation earlier this year. ""Nathan Deal killed pro-gun bills in 2013. Will he do it again in 2014?"" the flier read with a photo of the governor. Next to the photo were several demands. ""No new mental health mandates. No new mandatory training requirements. No Gun Control, No Deals!"" The fliers were paid for by Georgia Gun Owners, which describes itself on its website as ""the ONLY no-compromise, no-sell out grassroots gun organization in the State of Georgia."" So, we wondered, what pro-gun bills did the governor eliminate this year? Patrick Parsons, the executive director of Georgia Gun Owners, talked about the matter with the Atlanta-based weekly Creative Loafing. ""Governor Deal, his staff, and others worked behind the scenes to water down pro-gun bills,"" Parsons said. ""They wanted to run out the clock. And that's exactly what they did. We want the governor to publicly support passage of clean, pro-gun bills, not bills watered down with anti-gun amendments."" The group handed out fliers in August at the governor’s ""Grillin' with the Governor"" event at Lake Lanier. Deal is facing a quandary, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution noted in April after two pro-gun bills were not passed during this year’s legislative session. The governor doesn’t want to be labeled as an obstructionist among gun supporters and have new conservative enemies during his re-election bid next year. ""We do think that over this next recess period that there will be an opportunity to bring the different points of view together in a more orderly fashion than the last few days of the session allowed,"" Deal told the AJC. ""And perhaps some middle ground can be found."" PolitiFact Georgia wanted to find out more about the veracity of the group’s claim. Parsons said he would provide information to back up the claim in the flier. PolitiFact Georgia called and emailed Georgia Gun Owners four times over the past month, but we did not get a response. We even took a drive to Kennesaw to the address listed on the organization’s website. The address was a UPS store. Brian Robinson, the communications director for the governor, said he was baffled by the claim. The fliers are apparently focused on two bills that included language concerning firearms training and gun laws for anyone with a mental illness. Republican lawmakers pushed legislation during this year’s legislative session that would allow concealed weapons in new locations, including the more than 50 campuses of the state's university and technical college systems. Current Georgia law permits students to keep firearms locked in vehicles in university parking lots, but nowhere else. Two bills aimed at easing some restrictions concerning guns on campus, House Bill 512 and Senate Bill 101, passed their respective chambers with some tweaks to the legislation. Neither bill, however, reached the governor’s desk for his signature. The Georgia Board of Regents, which provides oversight for the University System of Georgia, fought the bills. So, too, did University System Chancellor Hank Huckaby, a former legislator who still holds sway in the Legislature. Deal had concerns about some parts of the legislation, the AJC reported. On March 13, the newspaper reported that the governor offered support for only one portion of the bill that would strengthen the rules about how people with mental illness qualify for a weapons ""carry"" license. ""It expands the population who will be flagged by an instant background check, which the governor believes will protect innocent Georgians, "" Robinson said at the time. The Associated Press reported Deal’s staff forwarded an email from Huckaby to a state representative that noted that few states allow firearms on campus. The AP also reported his chief of staff made it clear in a meeting that Deal was not personally backing the proposal, although one of the governor’s Senate floor leaders was backing the bill. Deal’s staff said the lawmaker was backing it for his own reasons. House and Senate leaders worked on a compromise of their respective bills to come up with something that both chambers and Deal could support during the final two weeks of the session. On March 28, the final day of the session, the negotiations continued near midnight. No bill was passed. Sine die. ""We thought we had a deal,"" the AJC quoted an exasperated Rep. Alan Powell, R-Hartwell, chairman of the House Public Safety and Homeland Security Committee. Powell said in March that House and Senate negotiators had agreed, after Deal stepped in, to allow concealed weapons permit holders to carry weapons on college campuses with the stipulation that permit holders between the ages of 21 and 25 would have to complete an eight-hour safety course first. Senators then told House negotiators that they wanted to require anyone, regardless of age, to complete the safety course before being allowed to carry a firearm on campus. ""We had a conflict over some of the language that the Senate was opposed to,"" Powell told PolitiFact Georgia. Some lawmakers have said they oppose any mandatory training. Powell took issue with the description in the flier that the bills had been killed. ""Those bills are still alive and well and still kicking,"" Powell told us, adding they could be adopted in 2014. Powell said the governor did not talk to him about anything in the legislation. Powell said Georgia Gun Owners ""blamed our committee for a lot of things that were not correct."" To sum up, Georgia Gun Owners claimed Deal killed some pro-gun bills earlier this year. It does appear from public statements from Deal’s office earlier this year that he was concerned about some elements of the bills under consideration. So, too, were other key voices. House and Senate lawmakers are still debating the matter six months later. The flier suggests the failure of these bills to pass earlier this year was the governor’s fault. We think that’s a bit of a stretch",Mostly False,"October 1, 2013"
"Mental health provisions related to mass shootings ""got over 90 votes in the Senate.""","U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte, a Republican, is again backing programs aimed at identifying mentally ill people who pose a risk for mass killings. Ayotte, saying she has strong bipartisan support, has co-sponsored a bill geared toward education, awareness and intervention relating to mental illness since the mass shootings in Newtown, Conn., in December 2012. Ayotte introduced the Mental Health First Aid Act in January 2013, which never made it past a congressional committee. However, elements of that bill went into the Mental Health Awareness and Improvement Act that was part of the gun control legislation the Senate voted down in April. Two days after a mass shooting at the Washington Navy Yard in September 2013, Ayotte and Sen. Mark Begich, D-Alaska, issued a joint statement to Senate leadership advocating programs to educate teachers in recognizing symptoms of mental health illness and how they could defuse potentially dangerous situations. Soon after, she appeared on CNN’s The Lead With Jake Tapper. She said a bill that addresses mental health issues would pass the Senate easily. Ayotte said the mental health amendment that was attached to last April’s gun-control legislation passed easily. However, it was not enacted because the gun bill itself lost. ""I actually think it can be taken up separately and easily passed because of the mental health provisions. It got over 90 votes in the Senate and very little gets 90 votes around here,"" Ayotte said. We wondered whether the mental health amendment really got such overwhelming support. We looked at the official roll call vote on the amendment and found that it had indeed passed by a 95-2 vote on April 18. Despite voting for the mental health amendment she co-sponsored, Ayotte later became one of 41 Republicans who voted against the gun control proposal sponsored by Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Pat Toomey, R-Pa., that would have expanded background checks. Five Democrats also voted against it. The mixed messages these votes sent drew sharp criticism from critics. Ayotte responded with a statement that said: ""I believe that restricting the rights of law-abiding gun owners will not prevent a deranged individual or criminal from obtaining and misusing firearms to commit violence. While steps must be taken to improve the existing background check system, I will not support the Manchin-Toomey legislation, which I believe would place unnecessary burdens on law-abiding gun owners and allow for potential overreach by the federal government into private gun sales."" Our ruling Ayotte said that mental health provisions related to mass shootings ""got over 90 votes in the Senate."" While an early version of the bill never made it out of committee, the Senate did eventually vote, 95-2, for a mental-health amendment to a gun control bill. The full bill lacked enough votes to pass and was pulled from the floor, but she is correct that the amendment did get 90 votes",True,"September 24, 2013"
"""There are more guns than there are people in the United States.""","In the wake of Monday’s Navy Yard shooting, Eleanor Holmes Norton, D-D.C., addressed national and civic security. Holmes, the nonvoting delegate to Congress representing the District of Columbia, praised the quick police response, but she also noted that no one is entirely insulated from criminal acts. ""We understand that in an open and democratic and free society, you cannot make yourself impenetrable, especially when there are more guns than there are people in the United States today,"" she said in a press conference. Are there really more guns than people? We wanted to dig into the data. Let’s pin down the easy number: population. The U.S. Census Bureau puts the 2010 population at 308.7 million people. We can get even closer with their nifty population clock, which on the day we checked it estimated a population of nearly 317 million, based on migration, birth and death rates. Now that we have a frame of reference for Norton’s comparison, let’s move to the question of the number of civilian guns in the country, a murkier subject. As we’ve noted, federally sponsored gun research is scarce. Most of the available studies are estimates. Since most states don’t register guns or license owners, there’s no concrete thing to count, said Jon Vernick, co-director of the Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research. This June, at President Barack Obama’s request, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a report rounding up what we know about firearm ownership and usage. It offered a 2007 estimate of 294 million guns, but with a pretty hefty caveat: ""Basic information about gun possession, acquisition, and storage is lacking,"" the report read. ""No single database captures the total number, locations, and types of firearms and firearm owners in the United States."" The National Rifle Association usually describes the number as ""approaching 300 million,"" spokesman Andrew Arulanandam wrote in an email. Daniel van Hoogstraten, Norton’s spokesman, pointed us to a Congressional Research Service study that goes with a slightly higher ballpark: 310 million as of 2009. He made the case that gun proliferation in the country has been increasing at a quick enough rate to exceed the population. While that’s an interesting theory, we found no evidence to back it up. Since the CRS number is from 2009, the closest apples-to-apples comparison we can make is using the U.S. Census population from 2010. So that's about 310 million guns to 308.7 million people. Again, we can't get a firm grip on how much the guns number has changed since then, but the population has gone up by almost nine million, according to the Census estimate. Our ruling Norton claimed there are ""more guns than there are people in the United States."" There’s no way to know for sure how many guns there are, given the available data. The highest credible guns number we saw was 310 million, which bests the 2010 population by over a million. But it falls short of the 2013 population estimate. We don't have any reliable gun surveys to approximate 2013 numbers. There's a chance Norton is right, but the available evidence isn't definitive",Half True,"September 19, 2013"
"""The CDC issued a report commissioned by President Obama just earlier this year, and it found some very inconvenient facts. Armed citizens are less likely harmed by attackers. Effectiveness of gun control laws is mixed. Gun buybacks don't work.""","Did a report commissioned by the president find ""some very inconvenient facts"" about gun control? Conservative CNN Crossfire host S.E. Cupp broke it down in an episode last week: ""The CDC issued a report commissioned by President (Barack) Obama just earlier this year, and it found some very inconvenient facts. Armed citizens are less likely harmed by attackers. Effectiveness of gun control laws is mixed. Gun buybacks don't work. Shouldn't we be looking at irrefutable evidence, irrefutable evidence?"" Her liberal co-host Van Jones quipped, ""Oh, now Obama's CDC is irrefutable?"" We’ve looked into the state of gun research, which has been starved of federal funding since the late 1990s. Did a new report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offer strong evidence? The report Cupp mentioned was inspired by mass shootings during 2011 and 2012 in Tucson, Ariz.; Aurora, Colo.; Oak Creek, Wis. and Newtown, Conn. In January 2013, President Barack Obama directed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to research causes and prevention of gun violence. The agency turned to the Institute of Medicine and the National Research Council to bring together experts to come up with a ""research agenda."" They released a 113-page report in June that also summarized what’s known. Rather than break new ground, it focused on the need for more work. ""In the absence of this research, policymakers will be left to debate controversial policies without scientifically sound evidence about their potential effects,"" it said. Later, it urged: ""There is a pressing need to obtain up-to-date, accurate information about how many guns are owned in the United States, their distribution and types, how people acquire them, and how they are used."" Here’s what it noted about armed citizens, gun control laws and gun buybacks. ‘Armed citizens are less likely harmed by attackers’ The research committee summarized research on the ""defensive use of guns."" It did cite specific studies that showed lower injury rates among gun-using crime victims: ""Studies that directly assessed the effect of actual defensive uses of guns (i.e., incidents in which a gun was 'used' by the crime victim in the sense of attacking or threatening an offender) have found consistently lower injury rates among gun-using crime victims compared with victims who used other self-protective strategies,"" it said. It cited four studies, three involving criminal justice professor Gary Kleck of Florida State University, who was on the committee. But it also pointed out that effectiveness of such tactics likely varies depending on the type of victim, offender and circumstance. ""So further research is needed, both to explore these contingencies and to confirm or discount earlier findings,"" the report said. It also pointed out that ""even when defensive use of guns is effective in averting death or injury for the gun user in cases of crime, it is still possible that keeping a gun in the home or carrying a gun in public — concealed or open carry — may have a different net effect on the rate of injury. ""For example, if gun ownership raises the risk of suicide, homicide, or the use of weapons by those who invade homes of gun owners this could cancel or outweigh the beneficial effects of defensive gun use."" It cited three studies from the 1990s by Arthur Kellermann, now a policy analyst at Rand Corp., then said: ""Although some early studies were published that related to this issue, they were not conclusive, and this is a sufficiently important question that it merits additional, careful exploration."" ‘Effectiveness of gun control laws is mixed’ ""Mixed"" definitely describes the state of the research, according to the report, if not the effectiveness of the laws themselves. ""Whether gun restrictions reduce firearm-related violence is an unresolved issue,"" it said, noting that the ""effectiveness of various types of control is inadequately researched."" It goes on to cite studies that fall all over the map. Firearm legislation is associated with lower rates of fatal firearm violence. Except when it’s not. Even studies that show correlation have a hard time showing one thing causes the other. ""A paucity of reliable and valid data, as discussed in the sections above, is a major barrier to the development of the most effective policies, strategies, and interventions for prevention of firearm violence. Nonetheless, many interventions have been developed and studied, and they point to areas requiring important additional research,"" the report finds. Gun buybacks don't work There’s evidence gun buybacks don’t work, the report says. ""For example, in 2009, an estimated 310 million guns were available to civilians in the United States … but gun buyback programs typically recover less than 1,000 guns,"" it said, citing two two studies. It mentioned that on the local level, buybacks may function to raise awareness of gun violence. But it also cited a 2002 study that showed in Milwaukee, Wis., for example, ""guns recovered in the buybacks were not the same guns as those most often used in homicides and suicides."" Our ruling Cupp said that a CDC report this year found: ""Armed citizens are less likely harmed by attackers. Effectiveness of gun control laws is mixed. Gun buybacks don't work."" The report, which summarized the state of gun research and outlined areas for new investigation, cited studies that showed crime victims who used guns had lower injury rates. But it also noted a need to explore other factors and ""confirm or discount"" earlier research. On gun control laws, the research itself is mixed — and there’s a ""paucity of reliable and valid data"" on which to base it. The report did cite evidence that gun buybacks don’t work. Cupp exaggerated the findings of the CDC report, which merely rounded up studies as it argued for more and better research. In most cases, the report was intended to spur more research, not settle controversial claims once and for all",Half True,"September 18, 2013"
An average of seven children in America are killed by guns every day.,"There’s little that is more tragic than the death of a child. One group recently attempted to use those emotions to sway a prominent Georgia lawmaker to its side in the national gun legislation debate. Mayors Against Illegal Guns sent backpacks to the Atlanta office of U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss that were filled with postcards calling on him to support ""comprehensive, life-saving background checks on all commercial gun sales."" ""[S]even backpacks will be dropped to represent the seven children and young people who are murdered with guns every day in America,"" the Mayors Against Illegal Guns news release reads. ""Every day, 33 Americans are murdered with guns in America — and seven of those are children."" PolitiFact Georgia read about this on the website Georgia Unfiltered and wondered whether Mayors Against Illegal Guns was correct about how many children were shot and killed every day in America. Mayors Against Illegal Guns was co-founded in 2006 by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Boston Mayor Thomas Menino. The coalition wants legislation passed that would require background checks on all gun sales. It claims more than 1,000 members across political party lines. Georgia mayors in the organization include Atlanta’s Kasim Reed, Roswell’s Jere Wood and Earnestine Pittman of East Point. The coalition has been pressuring senators such as Chambliss who’ve either been on the fence or against gun bills it supports. Chambliss voted against a gun-control measure earlier this year. That amendment  would have allowed a vote on a measure to require nearly all gun buyers to undergo background checks. The coalition said it based its claim on data from the Atlanta-based U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It also noted that other organizations, such as the Children’s Defense Fund, have touted similar numbers. In July, the Children’s Defense Fund released a report that found 2,694 children and teens were killed by guns in 2010. That’s an average of 7.4 deaths a day. Raymonde Charles, a spokeswoman for the CDF, said it began compiling such data on its own 20 years ago and noted it refers to this age group as ""children and teens"" to reflect that its data include 18- and 19-year-olds. Here’s a chart the mayors coalition shared with PolitiFact:   Year Gun homicides 0-20 Gun deaths 0-20 2006 2,813 4,064 2007 2,725 3,871 2008 2,597 3,777 2009 2,352 3,539 2010 2,308 3,459 Average 2,559 3,742 Per day 7.0 10.3 We looked at the CDC site and did a search for how many people 18 and under were killed in homicides by guns in each of those years. The numbers do not include suicides. A CDC spokesman confirmed that is the best way to research such information. Here were the totals: 2006:        1,629 2007:        1,568 2008:        1,486 2009:        1,359 2010:        1,260 That’s a total of 7,302 deaths, an average of four a day. Yes, we included the extra day in 2008 for our calculation. An average of four children killed by homicides from guns a day is troubling, but it is substantially less than seven a day. We asked the coalition why it decided to use those 20 and younger for its claim as opposed to 18 and under. Some may not consider anyone older than 16 a child, since that’s the age most states allow someone to get a driver’s license or get married (with parental consent). The coalition said it included victims under 21 because they cannot legally buy firearms or possess a gun in some states. ""The unfortunate reality is that the most recent CDC research shows that we lose seven children - not yet twenty one years old - to gun violence every day in America,"" Mark Glaze, the executive director of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, said in a statement to PolitiFact Georgia. ""These are young people - treated as minors under many of our laws - who won't see their twenty-first birthday because Congress won't pass the common-sense laws that a big majority of parents are calling for."" To sum up, Mayors Against Illegal Guns said in a news release to U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss, in an effort to encourage him to support legislation that the group believes would keep firearms out of the wrong hands, that seven children are killed by guns every day. The coalition should have been more specific by saying it was referring to people under the age of 21. We believe that information would add significant context for those who may not believe anyone older than 16 or 18 is a child. The Children’s Defense Fund was more specific, noting its total included children and teenagers. The coalition’s claim is accurate, but it omits some important details",Half True,"September 18, 2013"
"""1 percent of candidates that (the National Rifle Association) endorsed in 2012 won.""","Both supporters and critics of the National Rifle Association have acknowledged that the pro-gun group flexes significant political muscle. But Van Jones, one of the hosts of CNN’s Crossfire, suggested in a recent show that the NRA’s reputation of invincibility is exaggerated. ""The NRA is not popular on a big scale,"" Jones said. ""They can cherry-pick their focus. ... 1 percent of candidates that they endorsed in 2012 won -- 1 percent."" We wondered whether the NRA was really as ineffectual in 2012 as Jones suggested. Neither Jones nor the NRA responded to inquiries for this story, but we suspect that Jones was referring to research released after the 2012 election by the Sunlight Foundation, a nonprofit group that tracks money in politics. The foundation looked at a variety of politically active groups to determine how much of the money they spent on the 2012 election was directed toward supporting candidates who won or opposing candidates who lost, as opposed to money spent on candidates who lost or against candidates who won. The foundation then produced a ""return on investment"" -- the percentage of the group’s money that was spent on races that ended with the group’s desired result. In 2012, a year when President Barack Obama won a second term and the Democrats held the Senate, a number of liberal groups fared well on this score: Affiliates of Planned Parenthood, the Service Employees International Union and the League of Conservation Voters finished with returns on investment of 80 percent and higher. By contrast, conservative or pro-business groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce or the Karl Rove-founded American Crossroads finished with percentages in the single digits. So how did the NRA do? Sunlight looked at two of its affiliates -- the Political Victory Fund and the Institute for Legislative Action. (The two groups are organized under different parts of the tax code, but they have the same goal -- promoting candidates who support the NRA’s agenda.) According to Sunlight, the Political Victory Fund spent $11,159,493 but generated a minuscule 0.83 percent return on investment. A big reason for the poor showing was that more than four of every five dollars the group spent was either against Obama or for Mitt Romney in the presidential race, and of course Obama won. Meanwhile, the return on investment for the $7,448,017 spent by the Institute for Legislative Action was a bit higher -- 10.74 percent. So right off the bat, Jones’ summary is misleading -- one of the two NRA affiliates produced a success rate of better than 1 percent. But we see an even bigger concern: Jones was talking about endorsements, but the Sunlight Foundation was looking at money. And the NRA has endorsed candidates without necessarily spending money. In fact, while receiving money from the NRA is nice for any candidate that supports its goals, an NRA endorsement even in the absence of money is a treasured asset. Once an endorsement is made, a candidate can reap benefits among voters who trust the NRA. It can be touted on a campaign’s lawn signs, at candidate forums, in newspaper profiles and on social media. To more accurately gauge Jones’ claim about endorsements, we tried to assemble a more complete list of endorsements, regardless of whether they came attached to money. First, we tallied the number of candidates who had received funding (or found themselves targets of opposition funding) from either of the two NRA affiliates. Then we added any additional candidates for whom the NRA issued an endorsement news release in 2012. To remain in tune with Sunlight’s methodology, we limited our list to federal candidates only. Ultimately, we found 49 NRA endorsements that ended up as ""failures"" -- that is, where the group backed a losing candidate or failed to defeat a candidate they opposed. But the NRA notched an even higher number of ""successes"" in 2012 -- 72 candidates that the group helped carry to victory, or that it helped defeat. That’s about a 60 percent success rate for endorsements -- far higher than the 1 percent Jones cited. Our ruling Jones said ""1 percent of candidates that (the National Rifle Association) endorsed in 2012 won."" An independent analysis did find that about 1 percent of money spent by one particular NRA affiliate either helped elect a winning candidate or helped defeat a losing one. But that ignores a second NRA affiliate that did much better, and the study in question looked at dollars spent -- not endorsements. From the data we compiled, the NRA’s endorsements were about 60 percent successful",False,"September 17, 2013"
"""Over the past twenty years, the number of homicides committed with a firearm in the United States has decreased by nearly 40 percent. The number of other crimes involving the use of a firearm has also plummeted, declining by nearly 70 percent.""","State Sen. Doug Whitsett recently took to the Internet to warn Oregonians that the Legislature was within a single vote of passing legislation that he said would have eroded the Second Amendment right to bear arms. We disagreed with Whitsett on the way he described the votes, in another fact check, but he said something else about gun-related homicides and crimes that we thought merited its own analysis: ""Unfortunately, too many people are simply unaware of the facts regarding the possession of guns, and the commission of gun related crimes. In fact, most families have been convinced by media reports that gun related crimes are on the increase in America. That simply is not true! Over the past twenty years, the number of homicides committed with a firearm in the United States has decreased by nearly 40 percent. The number of other crimes involving the use of a firearm has also plummeted, declining by nearly 70 percent … … All indicators point to the fact that our society becomes safer as more responsible families own guns."" We’ll be upfront: We have no idea if society is safer as a result of more responsible families owning guns. It’s not certain who owns firearms or how responsible they are. Also, some people would chalk up a decrease in firearm related homicides and crimes to better policing or to a decline in the crack cocaine epidemic of the 1980s and 1990s, or to other factors. Others would add that we should look at suicide and other statistics to get a fuller picture of how to address firearms policy. For example, more than 30,000 people die from firearms a year, including suicide. There are too many variables and opinions to make a definitive statement on safety and guns and society. But what we can fact check are the statistics Whitsett cites. Has the number of homicides committed with a firearm decreased by nearly 40 percent in the last two decades? Are other crimes involving firearms down nearly 70 percent? The Republican state senator from Klamath Falls said he based his remarks on a Bureau of Justice Statistics report from May 2013, which used statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There were 11,101 firearm homicides in 2011, down from 18,253 in 1993, according to the BJS report. That is a 39 percent decline. Nonfatal crimes involving firearms declined 69 percent, from more than 1.5 million victims in 1993 to 467,300 victims in 2011. Those numbers back up Whitsett. The Pew Research Center released a separate report in May, also highlighting CDC numbers. It gives the same percentages and offers other calculations that back up the drops, including rates per 100,000 people. The Pew report noted that many Americans are unaware of the declines. The reports do not state definitive reasons for the decreases, but do point out that decreases were much steeper in the 1990s than in the 2000s. Apparently, 1993 was a peak year for homicides and the country has fared better since then. The numbers between 2000 and 2011 have gone up and down. Homicides and other violent crimes involving firearms have declined over the last two decades. Whitsett picked the numbers and years straight from a federal report issued in May, based on CDC statistics. The Pew Research Center, which is nonpartisan, used the same statistics. Readers can argue over what the declines mean, but they can’t take issue with the accuracy of his numbers",True,"September 7, 2013"
"""Rep. Frank Wolf voted to allow terror suspects to buy guns.""","U.S. Rep. Frank Wolf, R-10th, was recently targeted by the Mayors Against Illegal Guns, a group led by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. ""Rep. Frank Wolf voted to allow terror suspects to buy guns,"" the group proclaimed on a web ad. We decided to look at this claim, which clashes with Wolf’s tough-on-terrorism record. The 32-year congressman has accused the Obama administration of covering up details about a terrorist attack last September on an American diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya. He has vehemently opposed efforts to close the Guantanamo Bay prison and allow civilian trials for 9/11 terrorists. Kelly Steele, a spokesman for the mayors’ group, said the ad is based on a July 17 vote in the House Appropriations Committee on an amendment to the nation’s Commerce, Justice and Science appropriations bill. The amendment, introduced by Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., would have allowed the attorney general ""to deny transfer of firearms to persons known or suspected to be engaged in conduct related to terrorism."" It failed on a largely party-line 29-19 vote. The mayors’ group has targeted each of the representatives who voted against the amendment. ""Under current law, someone can be too dangerous to board an airplane -- but can still legally buy guns and explosives,"" the group says in a web posting. ""This dangerous loophole in our gun laws is called the Terror Gap."" The group is focused on an omission in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, which the federal government and most states use to screen those buying firearms from licensed dealers. People may be barred from buying guns for a number reasons, including felony convictions, fugitive status, drug addiction, adjudication as mentally defective, status as an illegal immigrant, stay in the U.S. on a non-immigration visa, dishonorable discharge from the Armed Forces, a domestic violence conviction and criminal indictment. But the ban does not extend to those who are suspected of terrorist activity and are on the FBI’s terrorist watch list. That could include U.S. citizens, people in the U.S. on immigrant visas and people here from about 40 allied nations for which the U.S. does not require a visa. Since 2004, the federal government has kept data on the number of prospective firearm purchasers who are on the terrorist watch list. The 2011 cumulative figures showed of 1,453 people on the terrorist watch list who sought to purchase firearms or obtain an explosives license, 132 were denied for other reasons, while 1,321 were allowed to proceed. The FBI could not determine whether the purchase was actually made. The Bush administration in 2007 asked Congress to pass legislation to allow the attorney general to deny a firearm purchase or explosives license ""when the background check reveals the purchaser is a known or suspected terrorist and the attorney general reasonably believes that the person may use a firearm or explosives in connection with terrorism."" Every session since 2007, a bill to that effect has been introduced by Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., and referred to the House Judiciary Committee, where it has never come up for a vote. The National Rifle Association has strongly opposed the legislation, saying it could be used to persecute law-abiding gun owners. A 2009 report by the General Accounting Office said if Congress wants to ban firearm sales to suspected terrorists, it should require the Justice Department to establish guidelines to protect privacy and civil liberties. Wolf is open-minded to closing the ""terror gap"", but believes the thorny issues should be resolved in the Judiciary Committee, according to Dan Scandling, the congressman’s chief of staff. Scandling said the congressman’s vote against the bill reflected his dissatisfaction with the ""gotcha"" procedure of bringing it up in the Appropriations Committee.   Matthew Dennis, a spokesman for Rep. Lowey, said the congresswoman sidestepped the Committee because the it was killing ground for the legislation. ""Members of Congress who support closing this dangerous loophole have tried every avenue possible,"" he said. In 2011, Lowey offered an identical amendment in the Appropriations Committee that was defeated by a 27-18 vote with Wolf voting against it. An article in The Hill said Wolf offered to work Lowey to ""refine the amendment,"" but the congresswoman rejected his offer. The article said, ""Wolf said the amendment affected too many Americans since more than 500,000 people are on the terrorist list, according to the Justice Department. He noted that he regularly helps ordinary constituents get off the no-fly list after being put there by mistake."" A few final notes: Tom Culligan, Wolf’s legislative director, said the congressman supports the federal background check system and has voted to expand its funding. We should also mention that Wolf was endorsed by the NRA in last fall’s elections and received a B+ rating from the organization. Our ruling There’s no doubt that Wolf, sitting in the House Appropriations Committee, voted against an amendments to budget bills that would have allowed the attorney general to deny firearm sales to those suspected of abetting terrorism. Wolf had concerns that the legislation could trample the civil liberties of innocent people and objected to the procedure of bypassing Judiciary Committee -- a panel that has quashed similar bills since 2007. Mayors Against Illegal Guns goes a step further in saying Wolf ""voted to allow terror suspects to buy guns."" That’s an inflammatory statement that suggests Wolf put gun rights ahead of protecting the nation from terrorists. It ignores Wolf’s spurned offer in 2011 to work with the sponsor of the amendment to find a compromise that could keep guns away from suspected terrorists while protecting the rights of those who have been unfairly placed on the government’s watch list. So the mayors’ statement has accuracy, but omits important details about Wolf’s position",Half True,"September 6, 2013"
Says Ken Cuccinelli supported a law that could allow people to carry missile launchers into airports.,"In Republican Ken Cuccinelli’s Virginia, people could walk through airports with loaded missile launchers. So says Terry McAuliffe, Cuccinelli’s Democratic opponent for governor. ""In 2004, Ken Cuccinelli voted against making it a misdemeanor to carry a missile into an airport terminal,"" McAuliffe tweeted on Aug. 23. The tweet contains a picture of an airport sign with the silhouette of a loaded missile launcher.  The sign says: ""Attention Passengers Passengers are now permitted to carry missiles in Virginia airports. Your safety is our priority. --Gov. Ken Cuccinelli."" Underneath the sign, McAuliffe wrote, ""This is Cuccinelli’s Virginia."" We checked whether Cuccinelli really has voted to allow armed missile launchers in airports. McAuliffe is not the only Democrat making this explosive claim. It began Aug. 19 when American Bridge 21st Century, a pro-Democrat PAC, tweeted, ""Missiles in Airports? In 2004, Ken Cuccinelli voted against legislation to ban missiles and guns in airports in Virginia."" That same day, an entity called Terry4Gov tweeted a doctored picture of a smiling, dark-haired, man with a heavy beard carrying a launcher on his shoulder in an airport terminal while a missile rises to his right, tailing smoke. Terry4Gov describes itself on Twitter as an ""unaffiliated grassroots group."" We tried to reach a spokesperson, but group does not offer any contact information. Brian Coy, a spokesman for the Democratic Party, said he does not know anything about Terry4Gov, other than it is not affiliated with the party or McAuliffe’s campaign. The basis for all the claims -- including McAuliffe’s tweet, four days after the others -- is a 2004 bill that banned bringing a ""gun or other weapon designed or intended to propel a missile or projectile of any kind,"" into an airport terminal. That included any ""frame, receiver, muffler, silencer, missile, projectile or ammunition designed for use with a dangerous weapon."" Passengers checking firearms, law enforcement officials and approved airline employees were exempted. ""Critics of the legislation fought unsuccessfully to exempt holders of concealed weapons permits,"" the Roanoke Times said in a March 13, 2004 article. That’s exactly where Cuccinelli, then a state senator, took issue with the legislation. He was concerned that the bill could prevent people with concealed carry permits from possessing their firearms at airport drop-off areas, according to Anna Nix, a spokeswoman for Cuccinelli’s gubernatorial campaign. Despite Cuccinelli’s opposition, the legislation passed the Senate on a 23-16 vote and was signed by then-Gov. Mark Warner. There are a few points to make about the bill. First, the state has limited jurisdiction over airports. It can legislate items that may be brought into a terminal, but once a person gets to security checkpoints, federal laws take over. According to Transportation Safety Administration rules, travelers may only transport unloaded firearms in a locked, hard-sided container as checked baggage. All firearms, ammunition and firearm parts, including firearm frames and receivers, are prohibited in carry-on baggage. Another point: The sign in McAuliffe’s tweet implies that  state law defines ""missile"" as a warhead that’s fired from a rocket launcher. But Virginia’s code offers no definition of the term. State laws ban shooting or throwing missiles at vehicles, at or inside buildings and pointing or holding a weapon, including missiles, to induce fear. It also illegal to carry weapons, including missiles, into courthouses unless the person is a law enforcement official on duty. In 2007, Jessica Hall of Jacksonville, N.C. spent two months in a Virginia jail after angrily hurling a large McDonald’s cup filled with ice into the open window of another car in stalled traffic on I-95. Although no one was hurt, a Stafford County jury convicted Hall of maliciously throwing a missile into an occupied vehicle. According to an article in The Washington Post, the jury was instructed that ""any physical object can be considered a missile. A missile can be propelled by force, including throwing."" Finally, it should be noted that automatic firearms and other destructive devices, such as grenades and military-style missiles, are tightly regulated and difficult for individuals to acquire. Such weapons require registration under the National Firearms Act. The size of those weapons are restricted and someone interested in owning automatic firearms or any form of rocketry would need to find a registered dealer, undergo an extensive background check and pay federal taxes to do so. Our ruling McAuliffe, in a tweet bearing a picture of a loaded missile launcher, says ""Cuccinelli voted against making it a misdemeanor to carry a missile into an airport."" In 2004, Cuccinelli was one of 16 people in the 40-member state Senate that voted against a bill barring people from entering an airport terminal carrying a ""gun or other weapon designed or intended to propel a missile or projectile of any kind."" It can be argued that the description does  encompass missile launchers, but that’s an interpretation that doesn’t weigh the debate at the time the bill was considered. A 2004 news article said Senate opponents were concerned that the bill undercut the rights of some gun owners. The article made no mention of missile launchers. McAuliffe’s tweet focuses on the term ""missile"" and suggests that the bill’s purpose was to ban warheads from airports. But the term ""missile"" is undefined in state law and could mean bullets, rocks, or even a cup of soda if it’s thrown maliciously. So there’s a trace of truth to a deeply distorted and inflamed statement by McAuliffe",Mostly False,"September 3, 2013"
"""America’s gun-related homicide rate … would be about the same as Belgium’s if you left out California, Illinois, D.C. and New Jersey, places with some of the strictest gun control laws in the U.S.""","In a recent Facebook post, former Arkansas Republican Gov. Mike Huckabee used an unusual computation to play down the extent of firearm-related homicides in the United States. ""America’s gun-related homicide rate is nearly 20 times that of other high-income nations,"" Huckabee said in the Aug. 20 post. ""But it would be about the same as Belgium’s if you left out California, Illinois, D.C. and New Jersey: places with some of the strictest gun control laws in the U.S."" For us, this reminded us of the time one of our sources, in a fact-check about a federal budget claim, joked that ""I can meet my weight loss goals if I don't count my butt!"" Beyond Huckabee’s curious formula, though, we wondered: Is he right? Huckabee did not respond to an inquiry for this story placed through his website. We did find that variations of this claim had made the rounds on conservative blogs in the weeks before Huckabee authored his post. Let’s take a look at both ends of this claim. The United States For the U.S. part of the claim, we looked at FBI statistics, which break down data for firearm-related homicides for the nation as a whole as well as by state. Here’s a summary for 2010.   State Firearm-related homicides Population Rate of firearm-related homicides per 100,000 population California 1,257 37,338,198 3.36 District of Columbia 99 604,912 16.36 Illinois 364 12,841,980 2.83 New Jersey 246 8,799,593 2.79 Four states above 1,966 59,584,684 3.29 U.S. total 8,874 309,330,219 2.87 U.S. minus four states cited by Huckabee 6,908 249,745,535 2.77   So, removing the four states from the equation, as Huckabee did, doesn’t really budge the firearm-related homicide rate for the nation as a whole. Also, it’s worth noting that the three states Huckabee cited are not among the states with the highest rates of firearm-related deaths. (Washington, D.C., is, but it is an exception because it isn’t a state, but rather a city without suburbs or rural areas.) Several states have firearm-related death rates above 4 per 100,000, including one with strict gun laws (Maryland) but others in which Second Amendment protections are strong (Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri and South Carolina). Belgium The most recent figures we could find for Belgium are included in an international data comparison published by the United Nations in 2011. In 2004, Belgium reported a firearm-related homicide rate of 0.7 per 100,000, which is well below both the United States as a whole and the U.S.-minus-Huckabee’s-four-states figure. Of course, the data for Belgium is older than the data we used for the United States. However, according to the U.N. compilation, more recent figures for other western European countries show rates even lower than Belgium’s. In 2009 and 2010, the only European countries to post a rate higher than 0.4 per 100,000 were Croatia, Finland, Macedonia, Portugal and Serbia. Every other European nation that reported data during that period was below that threshold. (The Washington Post has published this chart, based on the U.N. data, that compares the advanced industrialized nations by their firearm-related death rate; it shows the U.S. with a much higher rate than any such nation except for Mexico.) So Huckabee’s comparison isn’t even close. Our ruling Huckabee said that ""America’s gun-related homicide rate … would be about the same as Belgium’s if you left out California, Illinois, D.C. and New Jersey, places with some of the strictest gun control laws in the U.S."" Not only is this a strange way to analyze the numbers, but it’s not even correct on its own terms. Even after subtracting these four supposedly high-crime jurisdictions, the firearm-related homicide rate in the United States is still about four times higher than the rate in Belgium and the rest of Europe",False Pants on Fire,"August 29, 2013"
"Says U.N. arms treaty will mandate a ""new international gun registry.""","CLARIFICATION, 4:06 p.m., Aug. 28, 2013: We amended this story to clarify that an explanation naming Sudan and Chad is hypothetical.   ""Ever since its founding 65 years ago, the U.N. has been hell-bent on bringing the U.S. to its knees,"" U.S. Rep. Steve Stockman, R-Friendswood, said in a recent fundraising letter. The letter, forwarded to PolitiFact by a reader Aug. 19, 2013, sought donations to the National Association for Gun Rights to battle ""the U.N.’s ‘Small Arms Treaty’ "" and said that the treaty’s provisions include ""mandating a new international gun registry."" Stockman also wrote that the treaty ""sets the stage for confiscation on a global scale."" A ""gun registry"" might facilitate that by telling the United Nations where everybody’s guns are. We wondered whether the treaty really creates a registry. We did not hear back from Stockman or the association about this claim, so we were unable to determine when the letter was sent out or to verify it had not been altered. But the same claim appears on a web page at the association’s site with a shorter version of the letter also attributed to Stockman. PolitiFact has looked at similar claims about the United Nations before, most recently finding that a letter supposedly outlining a U.N. plan to ""disarm civilians"" was fake. In December 2012, PolitiFact Texas rated as Pants on Fire a chain email saying the Obama administration planned to use international treaties to ban all U.S. weapons. And in August 2012, PolitiFact Georgia tackled a claim very similar to Stockman’s. Georgia Republican U.S. Rep. Paul Broun said in a video from the same gun-rights group Stockman was supporting, ""If passed by the U.N. and ratified by the U.S. Senate, the U.N. Small Arms Treaty would almost certainly force the United States to … create an international gun registry, setting the stage for full-scale gun confiscation."" PolitiFact Georgia rated that claim, including its implication of confiscating guns, as False. Among its findings: A July 27, 2012, draft of an Arms Trade Treaty that failed to gain U.N. members’ approval would have required the U.S. to report information on international arms sales. Some background from that story: The U.N. has been working on a treaty to regulate the global arms trade -- not just small arms -- for years. Backers say it would curtail mass killings and terrorism and keep dictators from killing their own people. On April 2, 2013, according to the U.N.’s website, the organization’s General Assembly ""adopted the landmark Arms Trade Treaty, regulating the international trade in conventional arms."" The U.S. said ""Yes"" in that vote, and White House spokesman Jay Carney said Jun. 3, 2013, that President Barack Obama planned to sign the treaty ""before the end of August,"" saying it was ""in the interest of the United States."" For the treaty to take force in the U.S., it would need to be ratified by the U.S. Senate, which on March 23, 2013, voted 53-46 to insert its formal opposition to the treaty into Senate spending legislation. The text of the treaty says its purpose is to regulate the international arms trade and prevent illicit sales and transfers. It applies to arms, ammunition and parts moving across a national border, specifically conventional arms in categories such as ""warships,"" ""combat aircraft"" and ""small arms and light weapons."" The treaty requires nations to deny authorization to exports of such armaments if they will be used for terrorism, to commit genocide, to attack civilians or in other war crimes, and to take ""appropriate measures"" if they detect that a shipment has been diverted. Nations are required to maintain a ""national control system, including a national control list,"" report exports and imports to the U.N. each year and regulate brokering with measures that ""may include requiring brokers to register,"" but the treaty doesn’t specify how countries must carry out these directions. Daniel Prins, chief of the Conventional Arms branch of the U.N. Office for Disarmament Affairs, told us by phone that the national control list will be ""an enumeration of the types of weapons you will report,"" starting with the categories in the treaty (warships, combat aircraft, etc.). Then, each year, nations will report imports and exports in the categories on their lists, Prins said: ""35 tanks to Germany,"" for example. Countries can be more specific, but it’s up to them, he said. The treaty emphasizes that the U.N. is leaving regulation of the arms trade within a country entirely up to that country. The preamble says the parties to the treaty reaffirm ""the sovereign right of any state"" to regulate arms in its own territory ""pursuant to its own legal or constitutional system."" It also says the parties are ""mindful of legitimate trade and lawful ownership."" Article 12 of the treaty requires member nations to keep records of exports and says each country ""is encouraged"" to keep records on arms transferred into or authorized to ship through ""territory under its jurisdiction."" Countries are ""encouraged to include in those records"" the ""quantity, value, model/type,"" the exporting and importing countries and ""end users, as appropriate."" Stockman’s letter includes some of the language in Article 12. Stockman wrote, ""The registry must include the ‘quantity, value, model/type, authorized international transfers of conventional arms’ and the identity of the ‘end user.’ "" But in the treaty, recording those details is ""encouraged,"" not required. Though Article 12 deals primarily with exports, its language also encourages keeping records -- possibly including ""end users"" -- on arms transferred into a country. Prins said the importers, exporters and ""end users"" referred to in the treaty will most often be nations, not individuals. ""This is a treaty on conventional arms, so it’s about battle tanks and attack helicopters and all that stuff,"" as well as small arms, Prins said. ""For each individual weapons system that you export, you want to see where that ends up and where it’s being used."" Giving a hypothetical example, he said, ""If you send that to Sudan and the next moment you see it actually popping up in Chad, then we have an ‘end use’ issue. Because if all went well, (Sudan has) signed an end-user certificate on that transaction,"" meaning ""they are supposed to be the last owner and user."" If the weapons system were used by another country, that would be a breach of contract. He said there should be no effect on, for example, a U.S. citizen buying a gun from a foreign broker because ""whatever broker you engage will need to be registered already with the U.S. government to be able to function as an arms broker."" That’s because the U.S. has some of the strongest arms import and export legislation in the world, he said. With this treaty, Prins said, ""we’re trying to get the world to adopt a transfer system that comes closer to what the U.S. already has."" Our ruling Stockman said a U.N. treaty is  ""mandating a new international gun registry."" His claim takes a treaty intended to curtail illicit weapons trade between countries and describes it as a step toward confiscating gun owners’ property. Nations that ratify the Arms Trade Treaty must track conventional arms that move across their borders, share some information about the transfers with the U.N. and other countries, then report the imports and exports in broad categories such as ""battle tanks"" to the U.N. each year. They must also regulate brokers, but requiring them to ""register"" is optional. Recording details such as the quantity and model of weapons in a shipment is also optional",False,"August 28, 2013"
"The book Little Red Riding Hood is something ""that’s been banned in America,"" but not assault weapons.","The image created by a pro-gun control group and widely shared on social media is designed to be provocative. Two youngsters sit in a children’s section of a library, one holding a fairy tale book and the other holding an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle. The caption: ""One child is holding something that's been banned in America to protect them. Guess which one."" The ad was created by Grey Group, an international ad agency, on behalf of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America. Moms Demand Action was founded in the wake of the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., by Shannon Watts, a 42-year-old Indiana mother who has worked as a communications executive. The group claims tens of thousands of members and more than 75 local chapters, and it has been active in organizing on gun policy through social media. A reader forwarded us the ad with the two children, asking us to take a closer look. We decided to check whether Little Red Riding Hood, the book held by the child, is something ""that’s been banned in America,"" and whether assault weapons haven’t been. We will start by noting that Watts, who did not respond to a request from PolitiFact, acknowledges that the ads are designed to be provocative. She told Yahoo! earlier this year that the ad is ""obviously meant to make a point and create discussion. The (National Rifle Association) has been very, very good at creating fear among their members that their rights are going to be taken away or somehow the government is going to turn against them. We're trying to create debate and discussion about the facts."" Still, we don’t think being provocative exempts the ad from being scrutinized for accuracy. 'Little Red Riding Hood' The Little Red Riding Hood shown in the image has indeed been banned before. The version of the 17th century fairy tale was adapted by the late, Caldecott Medal-winning illustrator Trina Schart Hyman and was originally published in 1987. According to media accounts, the volume became a target because one image showed a bottle of wine in the girl’s basket, a detail that had been included in the original version of the fairy tale. An Associated Press article quoted Culver City, Calif., assistant superintendent for instruction Vera Jashni saying that the inclusion of wine in the book ""gives the younger ones the wrong impression about alcohol. If they should refrain, why give them a story saying it's okay?'' Jashni told the AP that she was worried about lines in the book that said, ""The grandmother drank some of the wine, and ... after a while, the grandmother felt quite strong and healthy, and began to clean up the mess that the wolf had left in the cottage.'' So the Moms Demand Action ad has a point that the Hyman edition of Little Red Riding Hood has been banned before. Still, it’s worth noting some additional context. For more background, we contacted the American Library Association, the leading authority for tracking books that have been banned or challenged by parents in schools and libraries across the United States. It turns out that the only recorded examples of Little Red Riding Hood being banned took place in 1990 -- 23 years ago -- and occurred in just two California school districts, Culver City and Empire Union. When we asked the Culver City school district if the ban is still in place, they said it has been reversed. The American Library Association recorded three additional cases involving the volume, in Florida’s Bradford, Clay and Levy counties in 1990 and 1991. (One of the complaints in Bradford was that the wolf was too scary.) In these cases, parents or teachers challenged the books but administrators took no action to ban them. Indeed, Little Red Riding Hood doesn’t appear on any of the library association’s lists of most frequently banned books. The list of frequently banned and challenged ""classic"" books includes The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald, The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger, The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck, To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee and The Color Purple by Alice Walker. Frequently banned kids’ books include the Harry Potter series by J.K. Rowling and the Captain Underpants series by Dav Pilkey. So while the ad has a point that one version of Little Red Riding Hood has been banned in the past, there’s no evidence of it being banned during the past 23 years, and there’s no evidence of any bans outside of two school districts. Assault weapons The ad also has a point that there is currently no national assault-weapon ban. Such a ban was in force from 1994 to 2004, but it expired, and opposition from gun-rights advocates has kept it from being revived by Congress. However, a fact that somewhat undercuts the ad’s stark contrast is that seven states do ban assault weapons -- California, Connecticut, Hawaii (assault pistols only), Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York, plus the District of Columbia. Collectively, these states account for about 27 percent of the nation’s population. In other words, it’s inaccurate to suggest that assault weapons haven’t been banned anywhere in America. States also typically ban the sale of firearms to the elementary schoolers pictured in the ad. Of course, supporters of tighter gun laws note that state bans aren’t especially useful in the absence of a national law, since assault weapons can easily be carried across state borders. Our ruling Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America’s ad said that Little Red Riding Hood is something ""that’s been banned in America,"" but assault weapons haven’t been. We understand what the ad is trying to do, but its black-and-white language obscures that the ""bans"" being compared are not so clear-cut. Little Red Riding Hood was banned only in two school districts and nearly a quarter century ago; many books have been banned much more recently, and much more frequently, than that. In the meantime, there’s no national assault-weapons ban, but more than a quarter of Americans live in states that have banned assault weapons. The claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression",Mostly False,"August 27, 2013"
"Says ""your Legislative Assembly was within one vote of enacting each of those bills into Oregon law.""","If you think back, you might remember a time during the 2013 legislative session when there were talks about a slate of measures to help curb gun violence. But much like the gun control debate on the national stage, nothing came to pass and the issue was largely abandoned.   In a recent opinion piece for conservative political blog Oregon Catalyst, Sen. Doug Whitsett, a Republican from Klamath Falls, says, if not for one vote, the whole gun control narrative could have been completely different.   ""More than a dozen bills relating to firearms were introduced during the recently concluded 77th Legislative Assembly,"" he wrote. ""Most of those bills would have, in some way, impinged upon our second amendment right to own and bear firearms.""   He then listed seven of them and continued: ""Your Legislative Assembly was within one vote of enacting each of those bills into Oregon law. It was within one vote of grossly impinging on our second amendment rights.""   That’s quite the statement. We decided to take a look.   Whitsett argues that the Senate was deadlocked on this issue. There were 14 Republicans in the Senate, all of whom were opposed to the gun legislation. If the 16 Democrats had all voted in favor, the legislation would have passed. But, he notes, Sen. Betsy Johnson, a Democrat from Scappoose, was opposed. Hers was the vote that kept these bills from becoming law.   That strikes us an oversimplification of the process.   We looked at the measure history for each of these seven bills he’d mentioned by number.   Two of the measures -- the only two he mentions that originated in the House -- never got hearings in their committees. It’s a stretch to say they were a single vote from becoming law when they never even made it out of committee, let alone to the Senate, where Johnson serves. One Senate bill was in a similar situation.   Four other Senate bills he mentioned did get hearings and were all passed out of committees with recommendations that they be passed by the full Senate. However, Senate President Peter Courtney sent them all to the Rules Committee where they died a quiet death.   By Whitsett’s account, the reason they were sent off to die in Rules was that Courtney knew they had no chance of passing, thanks to the Republicans -- plus Johnson.   ""It was my understanding that had we not had 15 ‘no’ votes in the Senate, they would have passed with flying colors,"" Whitsett said. Without Johnson ""it would have been the typical 16-14 party line vote.""   He may be right on certain bills. Johnson definitely helped defeat Senate Bill 700, which would have expanded background checks for gun purchases, as The Oregonian’s Jeff Mapes reported.   Even so, that bill and the others would have had to make it through the House. Whitsett said he was under the impression the House had the votes to pass the gun bills. We can’t know for sure. House Speaker Tina Kotek had made it clear that jobs and schools were her priorities, not guns.   We chatted with Sen. Ginny Burdick, D-Portland, one of the most vocal supporters of the various gun-control bills. She said Whitsett was right that the unified Republican opposition certainly helped table the subject. Still, Burdick added, had those bills made it out of the Senate, there was no sure bet they’d make it through the House, too.   ""The background checks bill would have had a very good chance,"" she said, referring to Senate Bill 700. ""The other ones would have had a little tougher time.""   Whitsett said that gun-control advocates were within ""one vote of enacting each"" of the seven bills into law. Had he focused on Senate Bill 700 specifically, we might be inclined to agree. But some of the other bills did not even receive a hearing and there is no guarantee that others would have passed in the Senate, let alone received the 31 votes needed in the House",False,"August 24, 2013"
"""Polls show that 96 percent of New Jerseyans – and 95 percent of gun households in the state – support expanding background checks to keep guns away from those who shouldn’t have them.""","Near unanimous support in polls isn’t exactly a frequent occurrence. And it may be even more rare when the topic in question is one of the most controversial in this country: gun control. But that was exactly the case earlier this year when a handful of major polling organizations quizzed people on gun control in the wake of the December 2012 Newtown, Conn. shooting spree at Sandy Hook Elementary School that left 27 people dead, including 20 children. ""Polls show that 96 percent of New Jerseyans – and 95 percent of gun households in the state – support expanding background checks to keep guns away from those who shouldn’t have them,"" Navy Capt. Mark Kelly said in an Aug. 12 opinion column on NJ.com, the online home of The Star-Ledger. Kelly, a New Jersey native, is married to former Arizona Rep. Gabrille Giffords, a Democrat, who was shot in the head Jan. 8, 2011 during a public appearance at a supermarket parking lot in Tucson, Ariz. Six people were killed and 13 were wounded at the event, including Giffords. Kelly’s column expressed support for Gov. Chris Christie to sign some gun-control bills passed recently by the state Legislature, and urged Christie to sign another bill that would, in part, expand background checks on gun purchases and safety training for gun owners. As for the high approval ratings in Kelly’s claim, data supports it. Kelly was referring to a Jan. 24 poll done by the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute in Hamden, Conn., according to Katie Hill, press secretary for Kelly, Giffords and their group Americans for Responsible Solutions. The poll of 1,647 registered voters in New Jersey asked, ""Would you favor or oppose requiring background checks on people buying guns at gun shows?"" The response, according to poll data: 96 percent favored it. The figure was 95 percent for ‘gun households,’ meaning those households in New Jersey where a gun is present. Pia Carusone, executive director of Americans For Responsible Solutions, noted that federal law requires background checks for guns purchased from federally licensed firearms dealers, ""otherwise known as a gun  store."" That’s not the case, however, if guns are purchased from a private seller at a gun show – and the point that Carusone said Kelly was making with his claim. ""When we say expanding background checks, we mean to say to cover guns purchased at gun shows,"" Carusone said. The Truth-O-Meter reviewed this issue – commonly known as the ""gun show loophole"" -- in a May 2012 fact-check. At that time we confirmed that The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, or Brady Act, requires all federally licensed firearms dealers to run a background check on potential customers to ensure they are not prohibited from owning a gun. Private sellers without a federal license don’t have to meet the same requirement, although some states have stricter requirements than others. In addition to the Quinnipiac poll, we checked with other organizations in New Jersey to determine how their post-Newtown gun control polls fared. Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Poll, said the organization hasn’t done a poll about expanding background checks, but did survey residents earlier this year about whether gun control would influence their vote for governor in November. David Redlawsk, director of the Rutgers-Eagleton Polling Institute and a political science professor at Rutgers University, said an early February poll asked 794 New Jerseyans a variety of questions about guns. Two of six questions asked randomly were background-check related and had approval levels at 90 percent or higher. Approval levels topped 80 percent for the same questions posed to ‘gun households,’ he said. Fairleigh Dickinson University’s PublicMind poll in January asked questions about greater restrictions on guns and ammunition, and better management of the mentally ill, according to Krista Jenkins, director of PublicMind and a political science professor at FDU. Our ruling Kelly said in an opinion column, """"Polls show that 96 percent of New Jerseyans – and 95 percent of gun households in the state – support expanding background checks to keep guns away from those who shouldn’t have them."" Kelly was referring to a Quinnipiac University Polling Institute poll from January, with findings that match numbers he cited.

"A United Nations working group has ""adopted a proposed agenda"" to enable member nations to ""disarm civilians within their borders.""","A reader recently sent us a realistic-looking document from the United Nations with a pretty explosive claim -- that the world body is moving forward with plans to help member nations disarm their civilian populations of ""military grade,"" ""concealable"" and ""hunting grade"" firearms, and even ""ammunition and components to manufacture ammunition."" Americans who support the right to bear arms have long expressed worry that the U.S. government is on the verge of taking away lawful citizens’ guns, and that concern has only increased when a U.N. body is believed to play a supporting role. The document sent to us by the reader would seem to be (pardon the expression) a smoking gun. Superficially, the document has the trappings of officialdom -- a blue U.N. logo at the top, along with the name of the United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs, a real office. It’s dated Aug. 5, 2013, and labeled ""restricted."" The headline reads, ""Disarmament Commission -- Civilian Weapons Confiscation Study Group."" And it’s filled with believable bureaucratic jargon, such as creation of a ""codification framework"" and the need to undergo a ""full review by the Office of the Secretary General."" Here’s the full text: ""The issue of military grade weaponry in the hands of civilians looms ever larger in the face of the global implementation of 22/Agenda 21 by member nations. In particular, the United States of America has an estimated 500 million weapons in the hands of its civilian population. This is not just a static problem, it is a massive dynamic problem for the process of confiscation as there will be those who refuse to surrender their firearms. ""The conclusion of discussions by the CWCSG led to the adoption of a proposed agenda to begin the process for introducing to member nations a framework by which they can begin codification of national laws to disarm civilians within their borders through a graduated process. ""Within the discussion framework, we have identified several problem areas that must be addressed, they are: ""1. Classification of military grade weapons to be made illegal for possession. ""2. Creation of programs to provide reasonable compensation for voluntary surrender of said arms. ""3. Codification of laws to begin the restricting and strict licensing of concealable firearms. ""4. Codification of laws to begin the restricting and strict licensing of hunting grade firearms. ""5. Codification of laws to restrict the sale of, and possession of ammunition and components to manufacture ammunition. ""6. Finally, codification of laws to completely makes (sic) any and all firearms illegal to own, possess or use outside of military and law enforcement usage. ""7. Creation of a United Nations Police Taskforce with the specific mission of assisting member nations with the collection of weaponry from civilian hands. ""The CWCSG will submit its findings and final recommendations once we have created the codification framework for member nations for a full review by the Office of the Secretary General."" The document is persuasive enough to have been picked up by pro-gun advocates on a few message boards and Facebook pages. But is it real? When we checked with the United Nations, a spokesman declared it a fake. ""I checked the document number on our internal document system, and the reply I got back now was simply, ‘There is no document matching your request,’ said Farhan Haq, associate spokesperson for the Secretary-General. ""The document number (A/CN.11/L.72) doesn't conform to our standard system, in any case."" In addition, Haq said, ""there is no such body as a ‘Civilian Weapons Confiscation Study Group.’ Nor does the United Nations involve itself in confiscating weapons from member states."" Finally, Haq said, ""the use of blue ink, some of the type font and the scanner icon in the bottom right-hand corner are not found in real U.N. documents. So, in several different ways, this document is fake."" Our ruling A document found on the Internet and circulating via email and social media says that a United Nations working group has ""adopted a proposed agenda"" to enable member nations to ""disarm civilians within their borders."" If the document were real, it would confirm the worst fears of those who fear a mass confiscation of handguns, hunting rifles and ammunition in the U.S. -- but a United Nations spokesman cited several reasons for concluding that the document is a fake, including the fact that the study group referenced in the document does not exist",False Pants on Fire,"August 12, 2013"
"Says in Texas ""it's legal to shoot someone who's committing a ‘public nuisance’ under the cover of dark.""","Discussing the divide between states red and blue, former U.S. Labor Secretary Robert Reich recently said that Texans are allowed to shoot people who are causing a nuisance. ""If you want to use a gun to kill someone who’s, say, spraypainting a highway underpass at night,"" Reich wrote in a June 8, 2013, blog post at robertreich.org, ""you might want to go to Texas, where it’s legal to shoot someone who’s committing a ‘public nuisance’ under the cover of dark."" Reich, who headed the Labor Department under President Bill Clinton, has a law degree and is now a University of California-Berkeley professor of public policy. He told us by email that he was referring to a June 5, 2013, verdict that got national news coverage, in which a San Antonio jury acquitted a man of murder in the death of an escort he hired from an online advertisement. San Antonio Express-News and KSAT-TV news reports on the trial said defendant Ezekiel Gilbert testified that he had found Lenora Ivie Frago’s ad on Craigslist and believed sex was included in her $150 fee. Instead, she left after about 20 minutes, saying she had to give the money to her driver, Gilbert testified. The driver pulled away and Gilbert shot at the car with an assault rifle. Frago was hit and paralyzed, dying six months later when her family took her off artificial respiration. Gilbert's defense team argued that his actions were justified because he was trying to retrieve stolen property. They said that Frago misled Gilbert when they arranged the transaction, making her refusal to have sex or return his money into theft. Reich disagreed. ""Failure to perform a service that is illegal -- kidnapping a baby, bribing a legislator, delivering cocaine, or providing sex for money -- is not a theft,"" he said. ""Anyone exercising common sense would understand that this was at most a contractual dispute over what he paid for and what she owed him in return,"" he said, later adding, ""It must be that the jury regarded prostitution as a crime, warranting the use of deadly force. But since prostitution is not a crime warranting the use of deadly force -- it is typically prosecuted under nuisance laws,"" the verdict means ""it is permissible in Texas to shoot someone who commits a public nuisance."" In his initial emails to us, Reich said this was the only way to interpret the verdict. He later switched to saying it is ""one way"" to view the decision. Legal experts and Gilbert’s defense lawyer disagreed with him. Bobby Barrera, a defense lawyer for Gilbert, said Reich ""is flat wrong and not even arguably close to accurate on the interpretation of the law."" The law in question is state Penal Code Title 2, Chapter 9, Section 42, which says using deadly force to protect one’s property is justified in limited circumstances, including when the person ""reasonably believes"" such force is necessary to prevent imminent ""theft during the nighttime"" or ""criminal mischief during the nighttime."" Jurors concluded that the ""theft"" justification applied in this case, Barrera told us by phone, because testimony indicated Frago and her driver had a history of taking money from clients who believed they would receive sex in return. ""She was committing a scam,"" he said. Even then, Barrera said, the jury had to find other conditions were met, such as requirements that Gilbert reasonably believed he couldn’t get his money back any other way or without risking injury to himself. ""It is not open season on prostitutes"" or thieves in Texas, Barrera said. ""This has gone, as you know, viral with ‘It’s legal to shoot prostitutes in Texas,’ ‘Stupid Texans and their guns,’ "" he said. ""Nobody wanted to know the truth; they just wanted to conclude what they wanted."" As to shooting someone for committing a public nuisance, Barrera said, ""You cannot under any circumstances do so."" University of Texas law professor George Dix, who specializes in criminal law, told us by email, ""Reich, in my view, is simply wrong."" Frago and Gilbert’s transaction would be theft, Dix said, if Frago did not intend to provide sex at the time she made the agreement with Gilbert. ""What would make this criminal and not merely a civil contract dispute is the misrepresentation by which Frago obtained the money,"" he said. ""In fact, anyone with a basic knowledge of theft law would understand that this could have been theft rather than ‘just’ a contractual dispute,"" Dix said. ""It could be theft under Section 31.02 of the Penal Code if the deceased promised to provide sex for the payment and at that time did not intend to provide that sex if she was paid."" Even so, he said, ""The jury might not have been convinced this actually was theft, but also convinced the state did not prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that it was not theft."" That’s two legal eagles saying that, contrary to Reich’s assertion, the jury didn’t have to consider prostitution as a reason for justifying deadly force. Even if prostitution had been a crucial point, it’s not a ""public nuisance"" in Texas law. It’s classified under ""public indecency"" in Penal Code Title 9, Section 43.02. Public nuisances can be much lesser offenses such as creating noise, Texas District and County Attorneys Association spokesman Clay Abbott told us by phone. Reich’s example of the highway spraypainter bridges the gap: ""Spraypainting would be both a public nuisance and criminal mischief,"" Abbott said. Even if the offense were serious, he said, a jury would have to decide that other conditions were met. To justify deadly force in protecting a third person’s property -- namely, the overpass -- the damage being halted must be so extreme it could never be repaired; the shooter must have no other way to stop the spraypainter without risking injury and must have reasonably believed deadly force was the only way to stop the spraypainter. Spraypaint can be removed or painted over, so the example falls down right there, Abbott said. ""It’s a ridiculous statement."" Dix said, ""I stress this is not an example of a rule that in Texas one can ‘shoot someone who’s committing a ""public nuisance"" under the cover of dark.’ It is an example of a Texas rule providing broadly (and probably unwisely) that one can use even deadly force to protect property from loss or damage."" Like Dix and Barrera, Abbott told us Reich is wrong to say Texans can use deadly force on someone committing a public nuisance. They also emphasized that the existence of a possible legal defense does not mean the shooter would be acquitted or that shooting criminals is the right thing to do. One final point: We wondered why the law specified ""during the nighttime."" Abbott speculated it was a holdover from English common law. Many states once had definitions of burglary with a stipulation about nighttime, which William Blackstone’s 18th-century analysis of English law said makes the crime more serious not so much because daylight is lacking but because ""sleep has disarmed the owner, and rendered his castle defenceless."" Our ruling Reich said that in Texas, ""it's legal to shoot someone who's committing a ‘public nuisance’ under the cover of dark,"" claiming that a recent acquittal hinged on prostitution, that prostitution was a form of public nuisance, and that therefore it’s legal to shoot people creating a nuisance. Legal experts and a lawyer in the murder trial told us Reich was wrong. The verdict hinged on theft; prostitution is not a ""public nuisance"" in Texas; and state law doesn’t say deadly force can be used on people creating nuisances. Notably, too, the law includes many other restrictions on deadly force, not just what type of crime is being committed",False,"July 18, 2013"
"""In New Hampshire, 93 percent of Democrats, 79 percent of Republicans, 82 percent of gun owners and 60 percent of NRA households support background checks.""","
Gabrielle Giffords, the former Democratic congresswoman who was shot in her home district in Arizona, contends expanded background checks continue to be popular — even among Republicans and gun owners. 
Her advocacy group is now targeting states with senators who voted against a compromise bill in April that would have mandated background checks for all private gun sales, with exceptions. 
Giffords kicked off a seven-state tour the week of Independence Day with a USA Today op-ed arguing, ""there don't have to be winners and losers."" 
There’s support for a ""simple, fair solution: background checks for all potential gun buyers,"" she wrote in the piece, published July 1, 2013. 
""Expanded background checks continue to be popular with significant majorities, even in states with high percentages of gun owners and across all party affiliations. 
""For example, in New Hampshire, 93 percent of Democrats, 79 percent of Republicans, 82 percent of gun owners and 60 percent of NRA households support background checks."" 
The New Hampshire numbers caught our eye. Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte saw her poll numbers drop after she voted against the Senate proposal, and a sympathetic PAC launched an ad in her defense. Do Ayotte’s constituents support expanded background checks? 
What the polls say 
Giffords’ op-ed relies on polling conducted on behalf of her advocacy group, Americans for Responsible Solutions. 
The question: ""Do you favor or oppose requiring background checks on all gun sales including those sold on the Internet and at gun shows?"" 
Registered voters in New Hampshire who participated in the poll, done May 21-23, 2013, by progressive polling firm Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research, answered the way Giffords described. 
Our general policy is to give some credence to polls paid for by an organization affiliated with the individual or group making the claim, but also to look for confirmation with polls taken independently of the organization. 
No recent New Hampshire poll we found broke out respondents in all of those categories: by party, gun ownership and ""NRA households."" 
(We’ll note, too, that the GQRR poll memo didn’t define the NRA group. In previous fact-checks we learned similar phrases may include current and former NRA members.) 
But a smattering of polls from this year generally back up pieces of her claim.

The findings for New Hampshire Democrats in the Giffords poll were generally in tune with the other polls we found. But the Republican numbers, while still a majority, were significantly lower in two New Hampshire polls than the 79 percent Giffords cited — 63 percent in a Dartmouth College poll and 56 percent in a Public Policy Polling survey. 
Meanwhile, we’re not aware of any recent independent polls of New Hampshire NRA members. Two polls we have reviewed in previous fact-checks have looked at this issue nationally. But both were conducted by groups associated to one degree or another with the pro-gun-control position — one was sponsored by Mayors Against Illegal Guns, and the other was conducted by the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health, which is named for and supported financially by the founder of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. 
However, at least one independent poll this year, by CBS News and the New York Times found that nationally, 85 percent of respondents living in a household with an NRA member supported universal background checks. 
Meanwhile, a May report from Pew Research Center shows it’s a mistake to assume support for expanded background checks is the same as support for background check legislation. 
Support among Republicans and gun owners for expanding background checks in that national survey — in the 80 percent range — fell to around 60 percent when they were asked about the Senate bill. 
And while 79 percent of Republican gun owners favored background checks, just 43 percent wanted the Senate’s background checks legislation to pass. 
Our ruling 
Giffords, seeking common ground for gun control legislation, said ""in New Hampshire, 93 percent of Democrats, 79 percent of Republicans, 82 percent of gun owners and 60 percent of NRA households support background checks."" 
The numbers came from polling on behalf of her own advocacy group. We found some independent evidence that New Hampshire voters support expanded background checks, through the support is weaker among Republicans. 
It’s also important to note that support for background checks doesn’t translate directly to support for the Senate bill Giffords mentioned in her op-ed. Support for the bill itself commands smaller majorities, and a minority of gun-owning Republicans nationally.

"""When I was growing up as a kid in the city of Milwaukee, if we averaged 4 homicides a year in the entire city that was a record number.""","
At a Milwaukee forum entitled ""The Second Amendment and the Black Community,"" two high-profile African Americans with opposing views on firearms spoke of an earlier time they vividly recall as a safer time. 
Longtime community activist and radio voice Earl Ingram Jr., a critic of concealed carry laws, said his first question to classrooms of city students is always: ""How many of you know someone who’s been shot?"" 
""I’ll tell you, 60 to 70 percent and maybe higher will raise their hand,"" Ingram told an audience at the Community Brainstorming Conference breakfast meeting on June 22, 2013. ""And then I think about that question being asked to my generation. If one person raised their hand we would all look at them in disbelief."" 
Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr., who urges citizens to arm themselves to ward off harm, offered his own memories. 
""When I was growing up as a kid in the city of Milwaukee, if we averaged 4 homicides a year in the entire city that was a record number,"" said Clarke, 56. ""So a lot obviously has gone on since then."" 
A good chunk of the sheriff’s childhood overlapped with the 20-year run of Police Chief Harold Breier as Milwaukee’s top cop. Breier called Milwaukee ""the safest city in the nation"" just months before retiring in 1984. 
Clarke went to work in Breier’s MPD as a patrolman in 1978 at the age of 21, and later worked his way up to homicide detective and various command staff positions. He was appointed sheriff in 2002 and has been re-elected since. 
Is Clarke right that homicides were a rarity when he was growing up? 
We took a walk back in time through Milwaukee Police crime stats and news stories to get an answer. Clarke declined to discuss his remarks. 
One of the first news stories we found from the era said that Milwaukee’s 1960 murder rate per capita was lowest of any major city. At the time, Milwaukee was the nation’s 11-largest city (population 741,324). 
But Clarke’s memory for the frequency of homicides was fuzzy. He recalled ""if we averaged 4 homicides a year in the entire city that was a record number."" 
Milwaukee’s lowest annual homicide total in Clarke’s childhood was 12 in 1956, the year he was born. 
Homicides tallied in the 20s in most of his first 10 years, and then picked up their pace, totaling 36, 46 and 51 before Clarke’s teen years began. 
And if you include his early teenage years as part of his time as a ""kid,"" the count had risen sharply to 75 in 1973, when Clarke was 17. 
So, instead of coming in at record-setting lows, as Clarke recalled, homicide was doubling or tripling during his youth. 
As a point of reference, the figure of 75 was higher than the homicide total in both 2008 and 2009. At the same time, that figure looks low when compared with the early 1990s, when homicides hit 160 as crack cocaine and related violence took hold. 
The sheriff, we found, would have better made his point about changes in safety by citing per-capita figures and national rankings. 
PolitiFact Wisconsin ran those numbers in March 2013 when analyzing a dispute over homicide figures used by Clarke and Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn. 
The picture is much-changed compared with 1960, when that  study put the city’s homicide ranking as lowest among the largest cities. 
For starters, the city’s population is now 598,916, a number that dropped it to the 30th-largest U.S. city. And nationally in 2011, Milwaukee’s homicide rate was fifth highestin the country among cities of 500,000 to 999,000 people. And it was 18th-highest of 73 cities, when cities of 250,000 or more were included. 
Just looking at Milwaukee over time, the city’s homicide rate in 1960 was eight times lower than the 2010 rate, we found. 
Our rating 
Speaking about changes in the crime picture over time, Clarke said, ""When I was growing up as a kid in the city of Milwaukee, if we averaged 4 homicides a year in the entire city that was a record number."" 
The sheriff’s memory misfired. In reality, homicides ranged from 12 to 75 during Clarke’s pre-adult years, accelerating at a steady clip",False,"July 3, 2013"
"""In 1999, the NRA leadership in Washington, pretty much the same people intact, were for (expanded background checks.)""","Washington may have moved on to immigration and the scandal du jour, but the gun law debate still simmers in states like Sen. Joe Manchin’s West Virginia. Dueling ads from the NRA and Manchin target West Virginia voters: ""Tell Senator Manchin to honor his commitment to the Second Amendment!"" and ""Call the NRA and tell them to support criminal background checks!"" Manchin’s not giving up his quest to broaden gun buyer background checks, the Associated Press reported June 26, 2013. The Democratic senator told Chris Matthews on MSNBC that he’s still making his case to the people in West Virginia to resurrect the bill that died in April. ""When they start seeing what we have done to the bill, you know what they said? And you mean the NRA in Washington is against this? We have been fighting for some of these provisions for the last decade or more. ""And I said, all we have done — and I said, guess what? In 1999, the NRA leadership in Washington, pretty much the same people intact, were for this. I haven't changed. They changed, Chris."" Was the NRA leadership for the provisions of Manchin’s gun proposal back in ‘99? ‘Instant criminal background checks’ We’ve checked related claims from New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and President Barack Obama that Wayne LaPierre, executive vice president of the NRA, once supported wider background checks. It’s true he told a House subcommittee in May 1999 that ""it’s reasonable to provide mandatory instant criminal background checks for every sale at every gun show. No loopholes for anyone."" But the House rejected an expansion of background checks in June 1999 — a rejection the NRA supported. A Washington Post headline at the time said, ""NRA Achieves Its Goal: Nothing."" LaPierre’s testimony before the House subcommittee hadn’t been in support of background checks legislation — it was against an amendment from Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J.. In his testimony, he outlined a set of proposals the NRA at the time found ""reasonable,"" such as ""instant criminal background checks."" But the crux of his testimony was that he found provisions of the legislation unreasonable, such as the way the legislation defined a gun show, how the law handled inheritance of weapons, and that the instant check system didn’t destroy records of transactions immediately. The NRA ultimately backed legislation in the House that did expand background checks to sales at gun shows — but cut the time allowed for background checks to 24 hours, a change that ultimately killed the legislation. Manchin’s recent legislation, which he offered with Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, addressed a number of the NRA’s concerns with Lautenberg’s 1999 provisions. (We summarized Manchin-Toomey back in April.)  It didn’t apply background checks to transfers between close relatives. Its definition of a gun show increased the number of guns from 50 to 75 and excluded residences of private collectors. It ultimately would have cut the time allowed for background checks down to 24 hours. But the NRA still challenged applying background checks to transfers between distant relatives and ""lifelong friends,"" for example, echoing its opposition to 1999 proposals. Our ruling Manchin explained his continued pursuit of expanding background checks, saying that in 1999, even ""the NRA leadership in Washington, pretty much the same people intact, were for this."" He’s correct that LaPierre, at the center of the most recent gun legislation battle, testified before lawmakers that the NRA supported ""mandatory instant criminal background checks for every sale."" But then, as now, the group was opposed to specific legislative measures behind implementation of expanded checks. Even Manchin’s compromise measure may not have passed muster with 1999’s NRA. He’s right that the leadership expressed support for expanding background checks generally, but the details get more complicated, especially in the context of specific legislation",Mostly True,"July 1, 2013"
"""There are over 2,000 crimes recorded per 100,000 population in the U.K.,"" compared to ""466 violent crimes per 100,000"" in the United States.","The debate over gun policy has inspired a blizzard of messages on social media, from both supporters and opponents of gun control. We’ve checked some of these posts (often called ""memes"") in the past, but a reader recently sent us one we hadn’t seen, so we decided to take a look. The meme said: ""There are over 2,000 crimes recorded per 100,000 population in the U.K., making it the most violent place in Europe. Austria is second, with a rate of 1,677 per 100,000 people, followed by Sweden, Belgium, Finland and Holland. By comparison, America has an estimated rate of 466 violent crimes per 100,000. … So hey, Europe, how ‘bout you shut the #%[email protected] up about gun control?"" The meme includes a lot of figures, so we started out by looking at the United Kingdom and the United States. As we were conducting our research, we stumbled across a thoughtful critique of this claim on a blog called the Skeptical Libertarian that was written by Daniel Bier, a master’s degree candidate in economics at Rutgers University. (Bier fact-checked a claim that’s similar, though with slightly different wording than the meme we’re checking.) Bier’s primary concern about comparing crime rates in the United Kingdom and the United States is that the definitions of crimes in each country are significantly different. This was not reflected in news coverage in British newspapers that appear to have been the source of the meme. This oversight produced a misleading comparison. As Bier put it, ""The FBI’s Uniform Crime Reports defines a ‘violent crime’ as one of four specific offenses: murder and non-negligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated assault."" By contrast, ""the British definition includes all ‘crimes against the person,’ including simple assaults, all robberies, and all ‘sexual offenses,’ as opposed to the FBI, which only counts aggravated assaults and ‘forcible rapes.’ "" Once you know this, Bier wrote, ""it becomes clear how misleading it is to compare rates of violent crime in the U.S. and the U.K. You’re simply comparing two different sets of crimes."" We thought Bier’s points were reasonable, so we tried to replicate his approach. We looked at the raw violent crime numbers for each country, using statistics for England and Wales for 2012 and for the United States for 2011, in a way that sought to compare apples to apples. (We should note that the United Kingdom includes Scotland and Northern Ireland, but the numbers in the meme appear to be based only on crime in England and Wales, which are calculated separately.) For England and Wales, we added together three crime categories: ""violence against the person, with injury,"" ""most serious sexual crime,"" and ""robbery."" This produced a rate of 775 violent crimes per 100,000 people. For the United States, we used the FBI’s four standard categories for violent crime that Bier cited. We came up with a rate of 383 violent crimes per 100,000 people. This calculation suggests that there is a higher rate of crime in England and Wales, but the discrepancy is not anywhere near as wide as the one cited in the meme. However, before we put too much credibility on these calculations, we should note that criminologists say there is actually no good way to compare violent crime rates in these two countries. Our rough effort to equalize the definitions improved the quality of the comparison, but what we did is not enough to fix the comparison entirely, said James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University. ""Once you get away from clearly defined terms like homicides, all kinds of problems come in,"" Fox said. ""You have to take comparisons not just with a grain of salt but with the entire shaker."" For instance, the vast majority of violent crimes are aggravated assaults, and this is a category that isn’t as well defined as homicides, rapes and robberies. Many aggravated assaults don’t result in an injury, Fox said, and even police in the same country don’t always use the same standard in counting this particular crime. Another problem is that aggravated assaults, rapes and robberies are victim-reported crimes, so whether the crime gets reported varies widely, depending on such factors as the victim’s trust in the police. This difference shows up in comparisons of FBI crime data, which consists of crimes reported to police, and the far higher rates of crime victimization found in a survey of Americans by the Justice Department’s Bureau of Justice Statistics. The survey counts all crimes that respondents say they have experienced, not just those they reported to police. The International Crime Victims Survey, conducted by an arm of the United Nations most recently in 2005, shows the difference between reported crime and all crimes committed by conducting polls that ask people if they've been victims of specific crimes. Polling data showed that England and Wales had 2,600 cases of robbery per 100,000 population and 8,100 cases of ""assaults and threats"" per 100,000. While those figures are even higher than the meme suggested, the U.S levels are also much higher -- 1,100 cases of robbery and 8,300 cases of assaults and threats per 100,000. And the rate of sexual assault is actually about 50 percent higher in the United States than it is in England and Wales. So this data set doesn’t support the thrust of the meme, either. ""Recorded crime data are problematic due to definitional issues, reporting rates and other concerns,"" said Shane D. Johnson, a professor in the University College of London Department of Security and Crime Science. ""There may also be considerable variation across counties, or states."" When we presented the Skeptical Libertarian blog post and our own research to the source of the meme -- Adam Kokesh, a libertarian activist -- an aide to Kokesh sent us the original link from the Daily Telegraph and said, ""We appreciate the close eye on that post and all the research."" Our ruling The meme said ""there are over 2,000 crimes recorded per 100,000 population in the U.K.,"" compared to ""466 violent crimes per 100,000"" in the United States. Our preliminary attempt to make an apples-to-apples comparison shows a much smaller difference in violent crime rates between the two countries, but criminologists say differences in how the statistics are collected make it impossible to produce a truly valid comparison",False,"June 24, 2013"
"""Since Newtown, more people have died at the end of a gun than we have lost in Afghanistan.""","
In the six months since a gunman killed his mother, six educators and 20 children in Newtown, Conn., gun control legislation has ground to a halt in Congress. In the face of political opposition, mainly from Republicans but also from some Democrats, the White House has readied a more limited approach in a package of executive orders aimed at reducing gun violence. 
Vice President Joe Biden outlined those measures in a press conference Tuesday, emphasizing that President Barack Obama will still press for a new law. In making the case, Biden said, ""Since Newtown, more people have died at the end of a gun than we have lost in Afghanistan. Pretty astounding. Pretty astounding. And Iraq, as a matter of fact. Over 5,000. That's no way to run a country."" 
Obama repeated Biden’s stat in a tweet. Readers asked us if the number was right, so we decided to take a look at his numbers. 
The White House press office told us that Biden was speaking about American casualties since the start of the war in Afghanistan. That number is 2,106, according a fact sheet updated daily by the U.S. Defense Department. Another tally, maintained by the Associated Press, shows nearly the same figure. 
Firearm deaths are more difficult to count. Biden relied on a database assembled by Slate, an online magazine. The numbers there come from average people who send links of newspaper stories about gun deaths in their communities; we found no duplicate entries. This approach is likely to undercount deaths, and it still shows some 5,176 fatalities in the six months since Newtown. 
The numbers back up Biden’s claim. In a span of half a year, there were more than 5,000 gun fatalities in the United States. In a dozen years, fewer than half that number of Americans died in the war in Afghanistan. Biden also referred to Iraq. Deaths there reached 4,422, according to the Pentagon. That’s higher, but still less than fatalities due to firearms in America since mid December, 2012. 
We should note that Slate’s statistics don’t distinguish among suicides, homicides, accidents and law enforcement actions. 
Also, Biden's comparison doesn't take into account that the deaths occurred in populations of very different size. 
When Biden said ""that’s no way to run a country"", that would take in the entire U.S. population. We calculated the death rates implicit in his claim. When you do the math for the 5,176 gun deaths and the population base is over 316 million, the rate turns out to be .016 per 1,000. 
To make the same calculation for American service fatalities in Afghanistan, we contacted the Defense Department to determine the number of people at risk. The total number of soldiers deployed in that country for Operation Enduring Freedom is a bit over 823,000. The death rate comes out to 2.56 per 1,000. That’s nearly 150 times bigger than the death rate by guns in the United States since Newtown. 
A similar calculation for Operation Iraqi Freedom yielded a rate of 3.97 deaths per 1,000. 
To get a longer term view of firearm fatalities in America, we went to a database run by the Centers for Disease Control. There we learned that between 2001 and 2010, the rate was .103 per 1,000. That’s higher than the rate since Newtown but still 25 times smaller than for the Afghanistan war. 
Lastly, it’s important to note that one expects deaths in a war zone. The gun deaths in the United States represent deaths during peacetime. 
Biden said America has lost more people to guns since Newtown than it has in the war in Afghanistan. He is correct that more than twice as many people died in the past six months as did in 12 years of fighting",True,"June 20, 2013"
"The National Rifle Association was ""founded by religious leaders who wanted to protect freed slaves from the Ku Klux Klan.""","
On May 28, 2013, the Republican Party of Milwaukee County posted on its website a video that has been popping up elsewhere on the Internet. 
The video features African-American leaders speaking out against proposals to restrict gun rights at a Feb. 22, 2013 news conference in Washington, D.C. Among them: Harry Alford, president and chief executive officer of the D.C.-based National Black Chamber of Commerce. 
Alford, who spoke in Milwaukee in 2008, said at one point: 
""I want to thank the Lord for our Constitution. I also want to thank the NRA for its legacy. The National Rifle Association was started, founded by religious leaders who wanted to protect freed slaves from the Ku Klux Klan."" 
Well known as a defender of the right to bear arms, the 5 million-member NRA does describe itself as ""America's longest-standing civil rights organization."" 
But is that why it was founded? 
Not even close. 
What the NRA says 
Here’s what the NRA says on its website about its founding: 
Dismayed by the lack of marksmanship shown by their troops, Union veterans Col. William C. Church and Gen. George Wingate formed the National Rifle Association in 1871. The primary goal of the association would be to ""promote and encourage rifle shooting on a scientific basis,"" according to a magazine editorial written by Church. 
After being granted a charter by the State of New York on November 17, 1871, the NRA was founded. Civil War Gen. Ambrose Burnside, who was also the former governor of Rhode Island and a U.S. senator, became the fledgling NRA's first president. 
An important facet of the NRA's creation was the development of a practice ground. In 1872, with financial help from New York State, a site on Long Island, the Creed Farm, was purchased for the purpose of building a rifle range. Named Creedmoor, the range opened a year later, and it was there that the first annual matches were held. 
No mention of religious leaders, slaves or the KKK. 
Brief histories of the NRA by The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post contain no such mentions, either. We called and emailed the NRA to inquire about Alford’s claim, but the group offered no response. (Milwaukee County Republican Party chairman David Karst told us he wasn’t sure why the party posted the video on its website.) 
Alford’s evidence 
Alford’s wife, National Black Chamber of Commerce executive vice president Kay DeBow Alford, provided us three articles to back her husband’s claim. 
But none of them do. 
1. PolicyMic.com: A January 2013 article on PolicyMic.com, which describes itself as a platform to ""engage millennials in debates about real issues,"" notes that the NRA founders started the group because of the Union soldiers’ poor marksmanship and it calls the NRA the oldest civil rights organization in the United States. 
No mention of religious leaders founding the NRA to protect freed slaves from the KKK. 
2. Ann Coulter: In an April 2012 opinion column, conservative author and commentator Ann Coulter said that when civil rights leader Robert F. Williams returned home to Monroe, N.C., after serving in World War II, the Ku Klux Klan was ""beating, lynching and murdering blacks at will."" 
In 1957, Williams got a charter from the NRA, founded the Black Armed Guard and repeatedly thwarted KKK attacks, Coulter wrote. She didn't say whether the NRA played a role in the guard's fighting the Klan. 
Again, no reference to religious leaders or slaves. And the fighting against the KKK -- whether it involved the NRA or not -- would have occurred more than 85 years after the NRA’s founding. 
3. Psychology professor’s article: A January 2013 article by psychology professor Warren Throckmorton of Grove City College in Grove City, Pa., not only doesn’t support Alford’s claim, it disputes it. 
Throckmorton noted that the NRA’s website makes no mention of the KKK or getting guns in the hands of newly freed slaves. He said he found no evidence in the early charter of the NRA, or the biographies of the founders, either. 
Other evidence 
So, even tangentially, is there anything to Alford’s statement? 
Two historians -- Jerald Podair of Lawrence University in Wisconsin and Kenneth Janken of the University of North Carolina -- said there is no evidence to support the statement. 
But, as an aside, here’s more information on Coulter's reference to Williams, the civil rights leader, and the KKK in North Carolina. It’s from the University of Florida-produced documentary ""Negroes with Guns: Rob Williams and Black Power"": 
In 1956, Williams took over leadership of the local chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, which was close to disbanding due to the Ku Klux Klan. Williams filed for a charter from the NRA and formed the Black Guard, an armed group committed to the protection of blacks. 
It's unclear, however, whether the NRA provided any assistance, based on what Williams' widow, Mabel, said in a University of North Carolina oral history interview. 
Mabel Williams said her husband altered the occupations of the members when applying for the NRA charter. ""I'm sure when we joined and the years after then, had they known we were a black group, they would have revoked our charter,"" she said. 
Our rating 
Harry Alford, the head of the National Black Chamber of Commerce, said the National Rifle Association was ""founded by religious leaders who wanted to protect freed slaves from the Ku Klux Klan."" 
We can’t say whether he was misinformed or intended to mislead. But the NRA itself says the group was formed by Union Civil War veterans to improve soldiers’ marksmanship. And we found no evidence that religious leaders founded the NRA to protect freed slaves from the KKK",False Pants on Fire,"June 5, 2013"
"""The UK has an unarmed police force and a firearm fatality rate that is 40 times lower per capita than in the U.S.""","
The Rhode Island Board of Education voted on May 23, 2013, to authorize its two colleges and the University of Rhode Island to arm their campus police if they so chose. 
Prior to the vote, as the board and the General Assembly were considering the issue, URI Prof. Peter Nightingale expressed his opposition. 
In a commentary published May 8 on RIFuture.org,  Nightingale wrote that the proposal came out of ""little more than violence and fear-enhancing recommendations."" He wrote that having armed police can lead, out of fear, to shooting unarmed people. 
And he drew this comparison: ""The UK has an unarmed police force and a firearm fatality rate that is 40 times lower per capita than in the U.S."" 
We wanted to know whether he got his facts right. We tried to contact Nightingale, who teaches physics, but he did not return phone messages or e-mails. 
Anyone who read about the recent knife attack on a British soldier in London, in which the accused assailants were eventually shot by armed police, might immediately question the first part of the statement. 
So we checked to see what British news accounts, police department information and other documents would show about whether the police in the United Kingdom are unarmed. 
A BBC News Magazine article, published online in September 2012 and headlined ""Why British police don’t have guns,"" said that ""to most inhabitants of the UK -- with the notable exception of Northern Ireland -- it is a normal, unremarkable state of affairs that most front-line officers do not carry guns."" 
Most, the article said. It goes on to say that ""each police force has its own firearms unit."" 
Then we found statistics from the Home Office, a government department in the United Kingdom that is responsible for everything from issuing passports, to reducing crime, to dealing with threat of terrorism, indicated that there are ""authorized firearms officers"" throughout the United Kingdom. In the year ending March 31, 2011, there were 6,653 such officers in England and Wales -- about five percent of the total -- down from 6,979 the previous year. 
Most but not all the police in Scotland do not regularly carry firearms, according to Police-Information.co.UK, a site for those involved in law enforcement in the United Kingdom. 
And the number of times armed officers fired their guns in a year in England and Wales, according to the figures reported by the government, can sometimes be counted on one hand. 
During 2010-2011, police ""discharged a conventional firearm in three incidents,"" a drop from six such incidents in 2009-2010, according to data published by the British Parliament. 
In the year ending March 31, 2011, the use of armed officers was authorized in 17,209 operations in England and Wales. Of that total, the Metropolitan Police -- known as the Met -- who cover metropolitan London, were authorized to have armed officers in 4,672 operations. 
The Metropolitan Police, according to its website, has a Specialist Firearm Command, known as SCO19,  which ""provides firearms-related support to our unarmed colleagues."" 
""When the officers first arrive they will make an immediate assessment. If an armed containment is deemed necessary to isolate an armed suspect from the public, then two of the crew will deploy leaving one to control the incident, calling for further armed support and liaising with the local senior police officer,"" the Metropolitan Police website states. ""All these officers are personally armed with 'Glock' 17 self-loading pistols and two of the officers have access to 'Heckler and Koch' MP5 carbines."" 
And, the Metropolitan Police site adds, the force has specialist firearms officers who ""undergo advanced firearms training and are also available 24 hours a day."" 
Next, we looked at the second part: that the United Kingdom firearm fatality rate is 40 times lower per capita than in the United States. 
Gunpolicy.org, a firearm safety database hosted by the Sydney School of Public Health in Australia and partly co-funded by the Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs, keeps data on gun deaths by nation. In 2011, the rate of gun deaths of all kinds, including suicide, was 10.3 per 100,000 population in the United States. In the United Kingdom, the rate was 0.25 per 100,000. 
That is indeed 40 times less than the rate in the U.S. So Nightingale’s figure checked out. 
(The gap is even wider for ""gun homicides"": in 2011, the United Kingdom’s rate was 0.04 per 100,000 people, 90 times less than the 3.6 per 100,000 in the United States.) 
Our ruling 
Peter Nightingale, a University of Rhode Island professor, wrote that ""the UK has an unarmed police force and a firearm fatality rate that is 40 times lower per capita than in the U.S."" 
It’s true that some police officers in the United Kingdom are armed, but it’s a very small percentage. The vast majority are unarmed. 
And Nightingale is on target in saying that there are far fewer gun deaths in the United Kingdom than in the United States",Mostly True,"May 31, 2013"
"A law that mandates fingerprinting for gun purchasers is ""a requirement that's reduced gun crimes in the five states where it's the law.""","
With the debate over gun control still simmering, a reader asked us to fact-check an ad on Baltimore TV stations that promotes tough laws on gun purchases. 
The ad, was put together by Marylanders to Prevent Gun Violence, a group headed by Vincent DeMarco, an adjunct assistant professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. (We have written previously about the Bloomberg School’s role in gun policy research.) 
The group, whose board is chock full of Maryland political leaders, supported the gun-control bill signed earlier this year by Democratic Gov. Martin O’Malley. The group is now trying to shore up public support as the law faces expected legal challenges from the National Rifle Association and others. 
The ad focuses on fingerprint licensing laws. Under those laws, a potential gun purchaser must first obtain a license from law enforcement, which includes being fingerprinted, before being able to purchase a handgun. This is currently the law in Connecticut, Hawaii, Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York. 
Here’s the text of the ad, voiced by people identified on screen as a gun owner, a pastor and a mother: 
""Something had to be done, and here in Maryland we stood up and joined the governor and the Legislature to pass real solutions that reduce gun violence by getting weapons out of the hands of criminals, with a fingerprint licensing law that 68 percent of gun owners like me support, a requirement that's reduced gun crimes in the five states where it's the law. It will work for Maryland, and it could work for the entire country."" 
We wondered if the fingerprint laws have ""reduced gun crimes in the five states where it's the law""? 
By using the term ""reduced,"" the ad is saying that gun crime was high before passage of these laws, and then dropped after they were enacted. 
But that’s not what the data shows. In fact, there's no data that shows the crimes declined, nor whether the fingerprint laws were the reason. 
We checked with Daniel W. Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research and a professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, which the group has cited as a source. 
Webster agreed that the text of the ad could have been phrased more carefully. 
""It would be more accurate to state that states with fingerprint-verified handgun purchaser licensing have much lower rates of gun homicide than states that do not,"" Webster said. He presented the following data for age-adjusted firearm homicide rates per 100,000 population between 1999 and 2010 for both the U.S. overall and for the five states with fingerprint-verified handgun purchaser licensing. The chart was compiled using data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

All this data shows is that states with the fingerprint law have lower firearm homicide rates, not that the rate fell after enactment of the fingerprint law. 
""Most of the laws were passed many decades ago, and there have not been studies to estimate their impact on violent crime,"" Webster said. 
There is some backhanded support for the ad’s claim in the one state -- Missouri -- that did the reverse when it rescinded its licensing requirement for gun purchasers in 2007. Webster said that following the law’s repeal, gun homicide rates increased by 25 percent between 1999-2007 and 2008-2010. (The Missouri case is analyzed here and here.) 
There also another problem with the ad’s phrasing: It was imprecise in using the term ""gun crimes."" The supporting data Webster cited refers to firearm homicide rates, which is just one subset of gun crimes. The FBI tracks gun robberies and gun assaults in addition to gun homicides. 
At least two politicians, O’Malley and Maryland state Sen. Brian Frosh, have been quoted in news reports offering versions of the claim that are more accurate. So how did the ad’s narration get mangled? 
DeMarco, the group’s president, told PolitiFact that his group ""ran the script of the ad by Prof. Webster before running it and he approved it as accurate."" 
But Webster responded by telling us that he approved the following language: 
""In the five states where fingerprint licensing is currently required for handgun purchases, gun death rates are among the lowest in the nation. According to experts at the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, cities in states with handgun purchaser licensing laws have much lower rates of within-state illegal gun trafficking than those without licensing. According to the Center, ‘research suggests that, once implemented, Maryland’s handgun purchaser licensing law will reduce gun trafficking, gun crime, and gun homicides and can serve as a national model for other states.’"" 
Somewhere along the way, the more accurate language got lost in translation. 
Our ruling 
The ad said that mandating the fingerprinting of those seeking to purchase a gun is ""a requirement that's reduced gun crimes in the five states where it's the law."" 
But that’s not a correct description of the statistics. Firearm homicide rates are lower in the five states that have such laws, but experts told us there are no before-and-after comparisons in those states to show that gun-crime rates were ""reduced"" after fingerprinting laws took effect. In addition, the ad refers to ""gun crimes,"" but the supporting data looks specifically at gun homicides, not robberies and assaults committed with guns. 
The differences in wording are subtle, but at PolitiFact, one of our core principles is that the words used to make political claims matter",Mostly False,"May 23, 2013"
"Says Kelly Ayotte voted to ""fix background checks.""","
New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte saw her poll numbers drop after she voted against a proposal to expand background checks on gun sales. 
Now coming to her rescue is Marco Rubio’s Reclaim America PAC. The Florida senator’s group is out with an ad that says Ayotte ""voted to fix background checks."" 
What gives? Did she vote against them or vote to fix them? 
The answer depends on how you define the fix. Gun control groups say background checks won’t be fixed unless they are expanded to cover more types of gun sales. The bill Ayotte voted for did not do that, but it would have added more records to the database used to run background checks in hopes of keeping guns from criminals and the mentally ill. 
Let's explore. 
Manchin-Toomey amendment 
The background check amendment, sponsored by Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Pat Toomey, R-Pa., was a compromise intended to replace stricter language in Majority Leader Harry Reid’s Safe Communities, Safe Schools Act of 2013. 
Current law requires checks on purchases only from federally licensed gun dealers. Reid’s bill would have expanded them to all transfers, even private ones among family members, with few exceptions. The Manchin-Toomey amendment attempted to find middle ground -- expanding the checks to gun shows and Internet sales, but not requiring them of family members and friends giving or selling guns to each other. 
Ayotte joined Republican colleagues in a mostly partisan vote, defeating the measure 54-46. (Procedurally, the amendment needed 60 votes to pass). 
Ayotte, in declaring opposition to the measure, said: ""I believe that restricting the rights of law-abiding gun owners will not prevent a deranged individual or criminal from obtaining and misusing firearms to commit violence. While steps must be taken to improve the existing background check system, I will not support the Manchin-Toomey legislation, which I believe would place unnecessary burdens on law-abiding gun owners and allow for potential overreach by the federal government into private gun sales."" 
The Republican alternative 
The same day as the vote on Manchin-Toomey, Republican Sens. Charles Grassley of Iowa and Ted Cruz of Texas introduced a substitute amendment. Like Manchin-Toomey, that amendment won a majority of votes (52-48), but not the needed 60. 
The Grassley amendment would have provided incentives for states to submit relevant mental health records to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System and required federal courts to do so. It also would have allocated money for prosecuting violations of the background check requirement. But it did not expand the requirement to cover any new firearms sales, such as at gun shows or over the Internet. (Editor's note: We looked more into the details of the Grassley amendment after we published this report. See our story for a more detailed discussion on the how the amendment would have worked.) 
Eight senators ended up voting in favor of both background check measures. 
In an op-ed several weeks after the votes, Ayotte said Manchin-Toomey would have expanded ""the broken background check system we have now."" 
""In my view, we shouldn’t be expanding a flawed system. The focus should be on fixing the existing system, which criminals are flouting. We need to make sure we are enforcing current law and prosecuting those who attempt to illegally obtain firearms,"" she wrote. ""And we must ensure that NICS includes records currently not being entered in the system, including mental health adjudications where an individual is found to be a danger to themselves and others."" 
Mayors Against Illegal Guns, a pro gun-control organization founded by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, said the amendment Ayotte supported did ""nothing to close the gaping loophole that allows criminals to buy guns without background checks."" 
Our ruling 
The PAC ad said Ayotte voted to ""fix background checks."" 
But we found differing opinions on what would actually fix the system. 
Reclaim America’s evidence is her support for a measure that would have put more records into the instant criminal check system, with the aim of capturing more people whose gun applications should be rejected. But to many in the gun-control debate, fixing background checks means requiring them on firearms bought at gun shows and over the Internet. 
The ad, as you might expect, only portrays one side of the background check debate. The other side could reasonably argue that Ayotte stood in the way of fixing the loopholes in background checks",Half True,"May 15, 2013"
"""In 2010, everybody said you can't dare let guns go into the national parks, and of course the rapes, murders, robberies and assaults are down about 85 percent since we did that.""","
During an interview on the MSNBC show Morning Joe, Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., argued for legislation he’s proposing that would allow guns to be carried into lands controlled by the Army Corps of Engineers. 
To make the case that guns make places safer, Coburn cited a dramatic before-and-after statistic that stems from the lifting of a ban on guns in national parks. Coburn was a leader in the effort to get Congress to approve the change. President Barack Obama signed the national park provision into law, and it took effect in February 2010. 
""In 2010,"" Coburn said on Morning Joe, ""everybody said you can't dare let guns go into the national parks, and of course the rapes, murders, robberies and assaults are down about 85 percent since we did that."" 
That’s a pretty stunning drop. Is it accurate? 
When we checked with Coburn’s office, John Hart, a spokesman, acknowledged that his senator had misspoken in a way that overstated the decline. 
Hart said Coburn’s office had compared FBI crime data on National Park Service land from 2008 to 2011, the most recent year available. By the office’s calculations, the number of violent incidents actually dropped by 12 percent, not 85 percent. 
""The numbers show crime rates have declined, but he misspoke when he mentioned 85 percent,"" Hart said. ""On balance, the facts support our conclusion that crime rates would go down under our policy, not the conclusion of the amendment’s critics who said that allowing guns in national parks would lead to more crime."" 
However, before we bless Coburn’s revised analysis, let’s look at the original data. Here’s a summary chart for violent crimes in the national parks between 2008 and 2011.

A few issues jump out to us. First, murders actually went up between 2008 and 2011, contrary to what Coburn said. 
More importantly, using 2008 as the ""before"" year in this before-and-after comparison amounts to cherry picking. 
As we noted, the law went into effect in 2010, so the most obvious way to frame the comparison would be to use the data from 2009 (the last full year before the gun ban was lifted) and 2011 (the most recent year). And as it turns out, the comparison to 2009 is not nearly as favorable to Coburn’s overall point. 
Between 2009 and 2011, these four categories of violent crimes actually rose collectively by 5 percent. Robberies did decline by 9 percent, but murders more than doubled (from a very small base), the number of rapes was stable and the tally of aggravated assaults -- by far the most common of these four crimes -- rose by 9 percent. 
Meanwhile, it’s also worth noting that the number of crimes in national parks is generally pretty small, which makes it unclear how much stock anyone should place in year-to-year percentage increases and decreases. 
Finally, we’ll point out that Coburn’s stated decline may -- or may not -- have been caused by the deterrence of having guns around. But if they were a cause for the decline from 2008 to 2011, what’s to stop someone from arguing that they were the cause of the increase from 2009 to 2011? The numbers alone simply don’t tell us. 
Our ruling 
On Morning Joe, Coburn said, ""In 2010, everybody said you can't dare let guns go into the national parks, and of course the rapes, murders, robberies and assaults are down about 85 percent since we did that."" 
Coburn’s office acknowledges that he misspoke; they actually calculated a decline of 12 percent, which is dramatically lower than 85 percent. 
But we find even the revised statistic to be questionable. It hinges on using 2008 data, when 2009 data would be more appropriate -- and a comparison using data from 2009 actually shows an increase in violent crime in national parks since the gun ban was lifted. Meanwhile, it’s far from clear that guns had an influence on the relatively small number of crimes that take place in national parks",False,"May 9, 2013"
"Proposed gun control legislation ""will outlaw practically every firearm, make you pay $100 per firearm, put you into a police database"" and make it ""nearly impossible"" to get a permit to carry a concealed weapon.","
The Newtown, Conn., school shooting sparked new waves of proposals to restrict gun ownership and use, including a package of bills in the Rhode Island General Assembly supported by Governor Chafee, Attorney General Peter Kilmartin, legislative leaders and many police chiefs. 
That, in turn, has sparked opposition from gun rights advocates. One of them, Ed Doyle, administrator of the Rhode Island chapter of Gun Rights Across America, issued a news release and posted a notice on Facebook announcing ""an emergency call to stand up for your rights"" at a May 1 House hearing on the Rhode Island gun legislation. 
""The wording in these bills will outlaw practically every firearm, make you pay $100 per firearm, put you into a police database, make a CCL [permit to carry a concealed weapon] nearly impossible to get, and eliminate the 2nd Amendment as we know it!!!"" the advertisement warned. 
Several hundred supporters and opponents of the legislation showed up for the hearing, which lasted seven hours. No votes have been scheduled on the bills. 
We’ll look at the elements of Doyle’s claim one at a time, leaving the Second Amendment part until last. 
$100 PER FIREARM: This is true. House Bill 5573 would require everyone who carries or possesses a firearm to register it at a cost of $100 per firearm. 
POLICE DATABASE: This is also true. Under the same bill, registration would be done by the licensing authority of each city or town. That would probably be the police department because the bill says registration information ""shall not be disclosed to any individual or entity … [except] to law enforcement organizations and personnel when that information is sought for legitimate law enforcement purposes."" 
MAKE CONCEALED WEAPON PERMITS  ""NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE"" TO GET: Under existing law, owners can get such permits from the local licensing authority -- usually the police chief -- or the attorney general's office. The law says local authorities ""shall"" grant the license. 
One bill in the legislative package, S 0865, proposes taking cities and towns out of that loop and giving the authority exclusively to the attorney general's office. 
The catch here, according to Doyle, is that the proposed law says the attorney general ""may"" issue a permit but doesn’t require the attorney general to do so. 
Doyle said an anti-gun attorney general could halt the flow of permits. 
Gun advocates worry about this because when U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat, was attorney general, some gun owners complained that the office was denying too many requests. In 1999, for example, 77 percent of the 216 renewal requests were approved and 23 percent denied. 
Even today, there are complaints that applicants are routinely denied and get their permits only on appeal. 
Amy Kempe, spokeswoman for Kilmartin, the current attorney general, said that in 2011, 85 percent of the 370 new applications were approved. In 2012, the approval rate was 75 percent for the 275 new applications. Between Jan. 1 and April 23 of this year, 65 of the 115 new applications have been approved, 26 are pending and 24 have been denied. 
She reported that only 2 percent of renewal requests were denied in 2011 and 2012. 
Kempe said the office did not have any data readily available on how many people have been granted a permit after appealing an initial denial. 
The bottom line: the proposed law would not inherently make the permits ""nearly impossible to get."" It puts the authority in the hands of an office that is currently granting the vast majority of permits it receives. An attorney general with a tougher stance on guns might approve fewer, but, on the other hand, a pro-gun attorney general might authorize every request. 
We rate this part Doyle's statement False.   
OUTLAW ""PRACTICALLY EVERY FIREARM"": House Bill 5990 and a companion Senate bill, 0859, would make it illegal for anyone to purchase, possess, sell or manufacture a semiautomatic assault weapon after July 1. (Legislators have promised that existing owners would be grandfathered.) 
Most firearms today are semiautomatics, which means that they eject a spent round and feed the next one into the chamber whenever the trigger is pulled. With a semiautomatic, you have to pull and release the trigger for each shot. (A fully automatic weapon continues to fire as long as the trigger is pulled.) 
What makes a firearm an assault weapon? The legislation defines an assault rifle, for example, as a weapon that can accept detachable magazines and has at least two other characteristics, such as a folding stock or a pistol grip. 
When we contacted Doyle, he said the lengthy description makes just about everything an assault weapon. 
Two gun control groups disputed Doyle’s statement. 
Kristen Rand, legislative director of the Violence Policy Center, in Washington, D.C., said the language of the Rhode Island bill ""essentially mirrors the expired federal assault weapons ban which is widely acknowledged as having major loopholes that allowed the continued sale of assault weapons [including the Bushmaster used at Newtown]. The bill wouldn’t even ban all assault weapons, much less any sporting firearms."" 
And Laura Cutilletta, senior staff attorney with the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence in San Francisco, said in an e-mail that the Rhode Island proposal's language is ""considerably weaker than the current California assault weapon ban"" because it requires at least two features to make a firearm an assault weapon. In California, only one can be enough. 
""And even under the much stronger California assault weapon ban, over 800,000 guns were sold in California last year!"" she said. 
Finally, Doyle took us gun shopping online. We started browsing the rifle and shotgun section of Walmart.com. Of the first 32 rifles on the list, the proposed law would affect no more than seven. When we searched for shotguns, the first page of results had 29 actual shotguns; no more than three would be illegal under the proposed law. 
(We didn't do a count of handguns or pistols because most of the items that came up in the search were pellet guns. Our favorite: the Undead Apocalypse Crosman Airsoft Pistol with Compensator, which comes in Zombie Green.) 
When at least 80 percent of the weapons seen in a spot-check could still be purchased, it seems ridiculous to say the wording of the proposed legislation would outlaw practically every firearm. That's worthy of a Pants On Fire. 
Our ruling 
Firearms rights supporter Ed Doyle said the wording of the gun control measures being debated at the State House ""will outlaw practically every firearm, make you pay $100 per firearm, put you into a police database, [and make a permit to carry a concealed weapon] nearly impossible to get."" 
The database and registration fee claims are correct. 
None of the proposed bills would inherently make it ""nearly impossible"" to get a concealed weapon permit. 
And we found that the definition of ""assault weapons"" in the legislation would not ""outlaw practically every firearm."" Consumers would have plenty of rifles, shotguns and pistols to choose from. 
Finally, none of the Rhode Island bills would eliminate any part of the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, despite Doyle’s triple-exclamation point assertion",Mostly False,"May 5, 2013"
"""If you are a federally licensed gun dealer and your license is revoked because you've engaged in misconduct ... your entire inventory under prevailing law is deemed your personal collection. You then can sell it free from any background checks.""","
As the nation debates proposed new gun restrictions after the Newtown, Conn., elementary school massacre, one issue is whether current law adequately regulates firearms dealers. 
During a recent appearance on WJAR-TV's ""10 News Conference,"" U.S. Rep. David N. Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat, spoke on the issue. Cicilline this year sponsored a bill, which has more than 60 co-sponsors, that would close what supporters refer to as the ""fire sale loophole."" The bill is still pending in a Congressional committee and it is unclear when, or if, it will be taken up. 
""If you are a federally-licensed gun dealer and your license is revoked because you've engaged in misconduct or because you've sold guns to people who shouldn't have them (if) your license is revoked, your entire inventory under prevailing law is deemed your personal collection,"" Cicilline said.  ""You then can sell it free from any background checks. So we reward bad behavior."" 
When we contacted Cicilline’s office to check his claim, spokesman Richard Luchette referred us to the federal firearms law.  We found Section 923 of Title 18, Chapter 44, which includes some of the regulations on federally-licensed firearms dealers. 
But the law doesn’t specifically address what gun dealers who lose their federal licenses can do with the firearms in their inventory. That absence, according to Cicilline and other gun-control supporters, is a serious loophole, allowing dealers to transfer their inventory into a personal collection and then sell those firearms -- without requiring buyers to submit to a background check. 
Luchette also sent us links to a couple of examples provided by Mayors Against Illegal Guns, headed by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Boston Mayor Thomas Menino. (Cicilline was among 15 mayors who in 2006 -- he was Providence mayor at the time -- attended the first summit, hosted by Bloomberg, that helped to launch the group.) 
One example the group cited dated to 2006 and involved a Maryland gun dealer who had lost his license for multiple violations in which firearms in his sales inventory were unaccounted for. 
After the dealer filed a federal lawsuit against the director of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Firearms and Tobacco,  the U.S. Department of Justice issued a legal opinion that said ""‘when a dealer loses his license he can dispose of his inventory by selling those firearms without being deemed to have engaged in the business in violation of"" a federal law. 
The gun dealer would violate the law only ""if he chooses to purchase and resell firearms,"" the opinion stated 
The Maryland dealer was found to be within his rights to transfer some 700 guns into his personal inventory and continue to sell them, despite having a record of previous violations in which guns in his inventory were unaccounted for, so long as he did not buy any additional weapons, according to an article in the Baltimore Sun. 
The other example cited by the mayors’ organization was an Ohio firearm dealer allowed to sell what had been remaining in his inventory after his federal license had been revoked. 
Seeking an independent point of view, we contacted the Bureau of Alcohol, Firearms and Tobacco, the federal agency that handles federal licensing of firearms dealers. 
An ATF spokeswoman, Debora Seifert, said that once someone is no longer a federally licensed firearms dealer, either voluntarily or because his license is revoked for some misconduct, then ""they are citizens, so they have the ability to convert the firearms from their [sales inventory] into their own personal inventory."" 
Therefore, she said, dealers who are no longer federally licensed do not come under the ATF’s purview. Because they are no longer subject to the federal jurisdiction of ATF, they can conceivably sell those firearms. Those sale are free from federal requirements for background checks of buyers. 
Siefert said some states may have their own laws that curtail firearms sales under those circumstances. Rhode Island is one of those states. 
Amy Kempe, spokeswoman for Rhode Island Attorney General Peter F. Kilmartin, said that ""Rhode Island is not a ‘loophole’ state."" The state’s law ""requires a background check and waiting period before any firearm is transferred to any purchaser so it doesn’t matter if the seller has [a federal firearms license] or not,"" she said by e-mail. 
Our ruling 
Cicilline said that ""if you are a federally-licensed gun dealer and your license is revoked because you've engaged in misconduct or because you've sold guns to people who shouldn't have them (if) your license is revoked, your entire inventory under prevailing law is deemed your personal collection …You then can sell it free from any background checks. So we reward bad behavior."" 
An ATF spokeswoman confirmed that is true. And examples of ex-dealers selling their inventories have occurred and been documented",True,"May 4, 2013"
"Federal prosecutions for lying on background checks to buy guns are ""down 40 percent"" under President Barack Obama.","
U.S. Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-6th, wants the Department of Justice to strengthen enforcement of existing gun laws before Congress adds more. 
He was part of a panel on ABC’s ""This Week with George Stephanopoulos"" on April 14 and criticized President Barack Obama’s administration for lax prosecution of people caught lying on federal background checks necessary to purchase to guns. 
""Enforcement is down 40 percent overall in his administration,"" Goodlatte said. 
U.S. Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., challenged the statement. 
""George Bush’s presidency had the same dismal record on enforcement of the background check as this presidency has during the last four years,"" he said. 
We decided to check whether enforcement is down 40 percent under Obama, a figure Goodlatte cited three days before gun control legislation failed in the U.S. Senate. 
The National Instant Criminal Background Check System began operating in 1998. It’s an automated system that enables a gun seller to instantly check a series of state and federal databases to determine whether a potential purchaser is eligible to buy a gun under national and state laws. A very low percentage -- about 1 or 2 percent -- are rejected each year, usually for a felony conviction or indictment. Other reasons, such as adjudication for mental illness or an outstanding order of protection, are also grounds for denial. 
Goodlatte’s spokeswoman sent us to TRAC, a Syracuse University website that collects monthly data from the Department of Justice. We looked there, as well as the department’s original reports. 
We focused only on prosecutions resulting from background checks -- as opposed to prosecution of other gun offenses -- because Goodlatte’s comments were directed at background checks. We also ignored prosecutions by state officials because the congressman’s statement referred to the presidential role. 
Federal prosecution data is available from 2002 through 2010, except for 2004. 
During the six years data is available for former President George W. Bush’s administration -- 2002-2003 and 2005-2008 -- a total of 628 federal cases were prosecuted as a result of failed background checks. That averages about 105 annually. 
Only two years of statistics are available for Obama’s administration: 77 cases were prosecuted in 2009 and 44 in 2010. That averages to about 61 annually. Another year of data should be released this summer. 
When we compare the administrations -- realizing there are years of data missing for each -- there has been a 42 percent decline in average annual prosecutions between the Bush and Obama years. 
So Goodlatte’s claim sounds right, but it’s missing important context: The Justice Department has never placed a high priority on pursuing perjury charges from background checks. There are about 70,000 denials for gun purchases a year. Under Bush, 15/100th of 1 percent of the cases were prosecuted. Under Obama, 8/100th of 1 percent of the cases were prosecuted. 
Goodlatte glossed over this fact as he assigned blame to Obama. He set up his statement with some quick statistics: ""We have determined of the 76,000 people who were found to have lied on the background check in 2010, 4,700 of them were referred by the ATF for further investigation and prosecution, 62 of them were prosecuted,"" he said. (We should note that 62 prosecutions is inaccurate; the correct number is 44). 
""Every Republican on the House Judiciary Committee signed a letter to the president and the attorney general asking why that is and why there isn’t greater enforcement,"" Goodlatte continued. ""Enforcement is down 40 percent overall in his administration. The answer we got about the background checks was, `those are paper crimes.’"" 
Goodlatte didn’t respond when Gutierrez said the Bush and Obama administrations ""had the same dismal record."" 
Why is Uncle Sam reluctant to prosecute these cases? A 2004 reportfrom the Department of Justice’s inspector general provided several answers. It said agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms viewed the violations ""as distracting from more important cases, such as those involving firearms, traffickers, gangs, arson and explosives"" and ""saw little purpose in investigating a standard case in which the NICS successfully prohibited a person from purchasing a firearm."" 
The report also said that the cases lack ""jury appeal"" for prosecutors because it is difficult to prove that a prohibited person intentionally lied on the background check and in many parts of the nation ""juries are reluctant to convict a person who attempted to purchase a hunting rifle."" 
Our ruling 
Goodlatte said enforcement of laws against lying on federal background checks for gun purchases ""is down 40 percent"" under Obama. 
The congressman had the percentage right, but he glossed over the law’s history of lax enforcement. During the Bush and Obama administrations, only a tiny fraction of 1 percent of the violations was prosecuted. The Justice Department has seen little value in prosecuting cases in which background checks have already stopped prohibited people from buying guns. 
Goodlatte, in seeking to level partisan blame, offered a juicy statistic without context",Half True,"May 1, 2013"
"Right now, if Rhode Island police come across a young person with a gun, ""they really don't legally have the right to take it away from them.""","
In the wake of the Newtown, Conn., shootings, the Rhode Island General Assembly is considering a package of bills intended to tighten the state’s gun laws, including restrictions on assault weapons and harsher penalties for gun violations. 
WPRI’s ""Newsmakers"" explored the topic on a program featuring state Rep. Linda D. Finn, D-Middletown, who has argued for more gun restrictions, and state Rep. Michael W. Chippendale, R-Foster, who has argued that laws already in place can address concerns if only they were properly enforced. 
At one point, Tim White, the show’s host, brought up one of the proposed bills, which would make it illegal for anyone under 18 to possess a gun, aside from exceptions such as hunting, rifle ranges and competitive target shooting. 
Chippendale called the proposal ""well intended, but poorly drafted,"" saying it would contradict another law on the books that provides for licensed hunting by young people. 
Finn countered that the proposal is intended for police on the streets of Providence and other cities when they come upon a minor with a firearm. 
""Because right now, if they [the police] come across a [young] person with a gun, they really don't legally have the right to take it away from them,"" Finn said. 
We wondered whether Finn’s statement was accurate. 
The legislation in question is actually an amendment of Rhode Island statute 11-47-33. 
The statute currently says ""possession and use"" of certain firearms by someone under age 18 is prohibited in Rhode Island unless he or she has had a permit issued -- under 11-47-34 -- by the Rhode Island State Police or by a local police chief. And that permit can only be issued, the law states, ""upon satisfactory proof of being engaged in a course of training in the use of firearms at a regular and recognized camp or rifle range, and provided that the person has the written consent of a guardian."" 
The bill in the legislature calls for dropping the words ""and use"" from 11-47-33. 
The reason? According to Amy Kempe, spokeswoman for state Attorney General Peter F. Kilmartin’s office, the bill was filed because ""currently, for a minor to be guilty of possession of a firearm they must possess and use the firearm."" 
Steven M. Pare, the Providence public safety commissioner, said police chiefs support the revision of statute 11-47-33 that would remove the words ""and use,"" making it illegal in most cases for juveniles simply to possess a firearm. 
Despite Finn’s assertion the the police can’t take guns away from minors, Pare, said that police can and do charge young people with possession of handguns, using another statute, 11-47-8, which prohibits minors from obtaining a carry/conceal permit. 
But there’s another issue in current law, that gives some credence to Finn’s claim. 
The Attorney General’s office says that due to what it calls a loophole, the law does not cover shotguns, rifles and other long guns, Kempe said, which could include such weapons as an AK-47, AR-15 and an M-16 -- so long as those are not fully automatic. (Possession of automatic weapons is illegal in all cases.) 
In other words, if the police see a juvenile carrying such a weapon, they can’t confiscate it under current law. 
Kempe said the ""long guns"" at issue are rarely something the police encounter on the streets involving minors; pistols and revolvers, which are already covered under current law and for which the police can arrest and seize the guns, are much more common, she said. 
Our ruling 
State Rep. Linda D. Finn said that if the police come across a young person with a gun, ""they really don't legally have the right to take it away from them."" 
Under current law, police can seize handguns from juveniles, the weapons most commonly used in street crime. But they can’t seize rifles and other so-called long guns. 
New legislation could change that",Half True,"April 23, 2013"
"""No poll done this year ... shows less than a majority to reinstate a federal ban on assault weapons.""","Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., told fellow senators before they voted down her renewed ban on assault weapons that the American people sided with her. What’s more, she told them: Every poll said so. ""In poll after poll, that support is there,"" she remarked from the Senate floor on April 17, 2013, the same day broader gun control legislation failed. ""In no poll — even with all the discussion, even with the mobilization of gun owners and the NRA, a majority in every single national poll done shows that the majority want controls over assault weapons. I know of no poll done this year that shows less than a majority to reinstate a federal ban on assault weapons."" A 1994 assault weapons ban, written by Feinstein, lapsed in 2004. After a gunman killed 20 children at Sandy Hook Elementary School in December 2012, she proposed the Assault Weapons Ban of 2013 — a renewal and expansion of the original ban. Senators, who considered it as an amendment to a broader bill, voted 40 to 60 against it. Did they vote against a majority of Americans? ""No poll done this year ... shows less than a majority to reinstate a federal ban on assault weapons,"" Feinstein said. We went in search of polls. ‘Assault weapons’ We combed through 18 polls with questions about assault weapons conducted between Jan. 9 and April 7. Nearly half of them occurred in January, both before and after President Barack Obama released his plan to reduce gun violence. He called for ""banning military-style assault weapons."" Feinstein’s bill, introduced a week after the president’s plan, proposed blocking the future manufacture, possession, sale and importation of 157 specific ""semiautomatic assault weapons,"" such as AK-47s and UZIs, along with any other weapon with a detachable magazine and at least one ""military characteristic,"" such as a pistol grip or barrel shroud. Pollsters used a range of phrases to describe firearms as they asked Americans about their support or opposition to a ban, from ""assault rifles and semiautomatic weapons"" to ""military-style assault weapons.""

In 15 polls, conducted by organizations from ABC News/Washington Post to Quinnipiac University, the idea of a ban on such weapons got support from 54 percent to 69 percent of respondents, depending on the timing and phrasing of the question. In two, from CNN/ORC International and Fox News in April and March, support was 51 percent — with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. That means the polls reflected support between 48 percent and 54 percent, perhaps a majority and perhaps not. In other words, the ""majority"" wasn’t statistically significant. And one poll, from the libertarian Reason Foundation, asked the question in a distinctly different way, and got a different result. Most pollsters asked whether people supported or opposed a ban on assault weapons. Reason asked: ""Do you think people should be prohibited from owning assault weapons, or should people be allowed to own them?"" They found that just 44 percent of respondents thought people should be prohibited from owning assault weapons. We’ll note that the question goes beyond Feinstein’s legislation. Nothing in the bill would have prohibited people who already owned such weapons from keeping them. Still, argued Emily Ekins of Reason, ""response variability across polls demonstrates support for an assault weapons ban is not as clear cut as some may have previously thought."" Indeed, a USA Today/Gallup poll from December, in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook shootings, also showed only 44 percent support for a law similar to Feinstein’s. Meanwhile, polls showed a partisan divide. In a January poll from Pew Research Center, for example, 55 percent of respondents favored an assault weapons ban. But just 44 percent of Republicans did. And a separate poll from Quinnipiac University in February showed that nearly half of Republicans might be less likely to vote for a member of Congress who voted for a ban on the sale of assault weapons — in addition to a third of independents and 11 percent of Democrats. That lack of support was most pronounced in the West. So, while national support was generally strong, as Feinstein said, individual lawmakers faced a different reality. Our ruling Feinstein claimed that a majority of the American people supported her bill, saying ""no poll done this year ... shows less than a majority to reinstate a federal ban on assault weapons."" She's largely accurate, though the ""majority"" in two national polls wasn’t statistically significant, and a poll by a libertarian foundation showed less than majority support for prohibiting assault weapon ownership. Meanwhile, limiting her statement to ""this year"" excluded a USA Today/Gallup poll from December that undermined her point. Still, the libertarian poll went beyond Feinstein’s proposal, which didn’t prohibit ownership of assault weapons by those who already own them. Otherwise, two polls teetered on the edge of majority support, while 15 others unequivocally supported her claim",Mostly True,"April 22, 2013"
"If an individual is determined ""to commit suicide, the availability of a gun is not a factor"" because they will find a way.","
More than 60 percent of the 31,000 gun deaths in the United States each year result from suicide, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
One of the arguments used by supporters of gun control is that restricting access to guns could prevent some of those suicides. 
Some gun-control opponents dispute that, arguing that suicidal people will simply find another way to kill themselves. 
Those opposite positions were expressed when WPRI-TV taped a debate April 12 on ""Newsmakers"" featuring two state representatives -- Republican Michael Chippendale of Foster and Democrat Linda Finn of Middletown. 
Finn said gun-related suicides are ""primarily young adults, young men having access to firearms and killing themselves."" 
""If an individual is under enough emotional or psychological distress where they’re going to commit suicide, the availability of a gun is not a factor,"" Chippendale responded. 
He went on to explain, ""There’s bridges to jump off. There are drugs to take. There are plenty of ways, if one is in such a state of mind to dispatch their own lives, where they will do it. The availability of a gun is not what makes a person commit suicide, mental illness is. A firearm is a tool."" 
We were interested in Chippendale's assertion that the availability of a gun is not a factor in whether a person commits suicide because suicidal people just find other ways to end their lives, a phenomenon researchers refer to as ""substitution."" 
Chippendale sent us to two studies to support his claim. 
The first, done in Australia and published in 2010 in the Medical Journal of Australia, compared suicide rates before and after the country instituted strict gun restrictions and a gun-buyback program. After one fifth of the guns were taken out of circulation, gun-related suicides decreased but suicides by hanging increased, suggesting that at least some people were switching to that method. (The low rate of gun use in Australia made it difficult to be definitive.)   
The other study was published in 1992 by the New England Journal of Medicine. Chippendale highlighted a chart saying that although having a gun in the home made it 4.8 times more likely that a successful suicide would occur, there were other factors such as whether someone was using illicit drugs, or had been hospitalized due to drinking, or was taking mental illness medication. But it didn’t address the substitution issue. 
The chief author, Dr. Arthur Kellermann, now a senior policy analyst at the Rand Corporation, said he published a more-relevant study in 1990 that compared suicide rates in Seattle and neighboring Vancouver, similar cities with different gun cultures. 
That analysis found that while the risk of gun suicide was more than twice as high in gun-friendly Seattle, that was offset by the fact that non-gun suicides were 1.5 times more common in Vancouver. 
""There is evidence of substitution,"" but it's far from universal, he said. It's mostly likely in cases where someone is hell-bent on killing themselves. ""For younger groups and suicides that are more impulsive, I think that ready access to a highly lethal means does make a difference. In many of those cases, if they survive the attempt, they are grateful they didn't die and have a chance at getting their act together."" 
In contrast to the few studies Chippendale offered to support his statement, we found several more that didn't. In addition, other suicide experts with whom we spoke said bluntly that Chippendale is wrong because suicide is usually an impulsive act, and having a gun available dramatically increases the chance that any attempt will be successful. Between 80 percent and 90 percent of those who use a gun die, compared with 3 percent to 6 percent of those who try by another means, according to various studies. Most people who survive one attempt don't try again. 
""If you are determined, you will eventually find a way to die. What people don't understand is for many suicidal people, that period of intense suicidality doesn't last that long,"" said Catherine Barber of the Harvard School of Public Health’s Injury Control Research Center. 
Among people interviewed after they nearly died from a suicide attempt, 71 percent said they had only felt suicidal for one hour or less before they tried to take their lives and only 13 percent said it was a day or more. 
And other data suggest that most people don't look for other means of suicide if a gun isn't handy. 
A soon-to-be-released Harvard study found that in 16 ""high-gun"" states where 50 percent of the households have a firearm, the total number of suicides in 2008 and 2009 was 11,889. In six ""low-gun"" states with a comparable population, there were half as many suicides -- 6,038. The reason: the rate of firearm suicides was a whopping 77 percent lower than in the ""high-gun"" states. 
The same trend is clear in earlier data from 1999 to 2007. 
And it's not because people are less-prone to suicide in ""low-gun"" states. In fact, the estimated number of suicide attempts was 23 percent higher in the low-gun states. 
So, Barber asked, if Chippendale were correct, ""why wouldn’t we simply see more non-firearm suicides in the low-gun states and roughly equal suicide rates across the two groups?"" But you don't. 
Other studies also suggested that Chippendale is wrong. 
In Israel, the Israeli Defense Force had a high suicide rate that dropped by 40 percent once the troops were prohibited from taking their guns with them when they went home for the weekend. 
In Great Britain, where putting your head in the oven was once a common way to kill yourself, the suicide rate dropped by a third when the country started using a less-toxic form of natural gas. 
In Sri Lanka, where the preferred method of suicide was poisoning with pesticide, the rate dropped by half once the country switched in 1995 to pesticides that are less toxic to humans. 
If Chippendale were correct, the suicide rate in those countries wouldn’t have gone down because these were people intent on suicide, Barber said. 
Said David N. Miller, a professor of psychology at the State University of New York at Albany and and president-elect of the American Association of Suicidology: ""Restricting the means of suicide in one area (for example, restricting access to guns) does not inevitably lead to an increase in suicide by other methods, as the politician suggests. In fact, this often does not occur."" 
Our ruling 
State Rep. Michael Chippendale said, ""If an individual is under enough emotional or psychological distress where they’re going to commit suicide, the availability of a gun is not a factor."" 
There is evidence that such substitution takes place, but it is limited and contradicted by other data. 
Most experts told us the real issue is impulsiveness. Some people determined to kill themselves are locked into that decision and will find another method if a gun isn't handy. 
But research suggests that most suicide attempts are not the result of such premeditation. Their determination is spur-of-the-moment. Thus, the presence or absence of a firearm can play a big role in whether the person is successful",Mostly False,"April 21, 2013"

Flanked by relatives of some of the slain children from Newtown, Conn., and assassination survivor Gabby Giffords, Obama emphasized how broadly Americans support expanded background checks for gun purchases. 
At several points in his remarks, Obama invoked his gun-policy adversary, the National Rifle Association. ""To the wide majority of NRA households who supported this legislation, you need to let your leadership and lobbyists in Washington know they didn’t represent your views on this one,"" Obama said. 
We found two independent polls have attempted to take the pulse of the NRA’s membership on universal background checks, the linchpin of both the failed compromise amendment sponsored by Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Pat Toomey, R-Pa, and the underlying bill sponsored by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev. Here’s how the data stacks up. 
• One poll was done by CBS News and the New York Times. The survey, conducted Jan. 11-15, 2013, found that 85 percent of those living in a household with an NRA member favored background checks for all potential gun buyers. 
• The other survey, by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, was taken Feb. 13-18, 2013. It found that ""people in NRA households overwhelmingly favor making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks: 74 percent favor this proposal while just 26 percent are opposed."" 
These results verify that rank-and-file NRA members and those who live with them favor universal background checks by margins of between 74 percent and 85 percent. 
Still, there’s a problem with Obama’s phrasing. He said that a ""wide majority of NRA households ... supported this legislation."" While the percentages supporting universal background checks in the latter two polls qualify as a ""wide majority"" in our book, each of these polls were taken before either of the two relevant pieces of legislation were filed in the Senate. Reid’s underlying bill was submitted on March 21, while the Manchin-Toomey amendment was submitted on April 11. 
So while the polls do demonstrate strong support for background checks -- a key element of both Senate measures -- it’s a bit of a stretch to say that NRA members polled supported ""this legislation."" The legislation in question hadn’t even been introduced yet. 
Our ruling 
Obama said a ""wide majority of NRA households ... supported this legislation."" Two fully independent polls showed that NRA members or households support expanded background checks, but the polls couldn’t have asked about the ""legislation"" Obama referred to because those measures had not been introduced yet",Mostly True,"April 19, 2013"
"A bipartisan background check amendment ""outlawed any (gun) registry.  Plain and simple, right there in the text.""","
President Barack Obama accused the ""gun lobby and its allies"" of lying about a bipartisan background check proposal that failed Wednesday in the Senate. 
From the Rose Garden, he charged: 
""They claimed that it would create some sort of ‘big brother’ gun registry, even though the bill did the opposite. This legislation, in fact, outlawed any registry. Plain and simple, right there in the text. But that didn't matter."" 
The background check amendment, sponsored by Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Pat Toomey, R-Pa., was a compromise intended to replace stricter language in Majority Leader Harry Reid’s Safe Communities, Safe Schools Act of 2013. 
Did it, in fact, outlaw any gun registry? 
‘A path to a national gun registry’ 
The government requires background checks for gun sales by licensed firearms dealers — but not for sales between folks who aren’t in the business of selling guns. 
Manchin and Toomey’s amendment expanded the background check requirement to sales at gun shows and those advertised in publications and on the Web. But it didn’t go as far as the original bill, which required background checks for all gun transfers with limited exceptions. 
That compromise wasn’t enough to attract the 60-vote supermajority required to pass the amendment. It failed on a 54 to 46 vote. 
Opponents had, indeed, raised the specter of a national gun registry. 
""If your private gun transaction is covered by Toomey-Schumer-Manchin (and virtually all will be) ... you can assume you will be part of a national gun registry,"" wrote Michael Hammond of lobbying group Gun Owners of America. 
The existing background checks require filling out ATF Form 4473. That personal information is then run through the FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System. The government is supposed to destroy personally identifying information, but gun dealers are required to store the forms. 
The government is then allowed to inspect them in the course of criminal investigations or to ensure gun dealers keep the records they’re supposed to keep. 
So what did the Manchin-Toomey amendment say about a registry? 
First, it made reference to federal law that already bans creation of a federal registry. 
Since the mid 1980s, it’s been against federal law for information from background checks to be ""recorded at or transferred to a facility owned, managed, or controlled by the United States or any State or any political subdivision thereof, nor that any system of registration of firearms, firearms owners, or firearms transactions or dispositions be established."" 
That’s why, if you’re cleared to purchase a gun, the FBI is required to destroy all identifying information about you before the next business day. 
The Manchin-Toomey amendment doubled down on this ban, declaring: ""Congress supports and reaffirms the existing prohibition on a national firearms registry."" 
It also declared that nothing in the legislation should be construed to ""allow the establishment, directly or indirectly, of a federal firearms registry."" 
Later, it added these provisions: 
• ""The Attorney General shall be prohibited from seizing any records or other documents in the course of an inspection or examination authorized by this paragraph other than those records or documents constituting material evidence of a violation of law."" 
• ""The Attorney General may not consolidate or centralize the records of the ... acquisition or disposition of firearms, or any portion thereof."" 
• ""Any person who knowingly violates (the prohibition against consolidating or centralizing records) shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 15 years, or both.'' 
So, the amendment prohibited the centralizing of federal records — and added the threat of prison. 
But those protections didn’t reassure gun rights proponents. 
The National Rifle Association argues that gun control supporters believe expanding background checks is a precursor to gun confiscation. An Arizona gun group spokesman told us the federal government would illegally collect background check information submitted to the FBI. Sarah Palin, arguing against the Toomey-Manchin amendment, said it ""creates a path to a national gun registry"" since dealers store background check forms and the bill didn’t explicitly ban copying them, storing them in various locations (rather than centrally), or keeping a list of them. 
She didn’t mention that existing federal law — referenced by the bill — already prohibits ""any system of registration of firearms, firearms owners, or firearms transactions or dispositions."" 
Our ruling 
Obama said opponents of compromise gun legislation ""claimed that it would create some sort of ‘big brother’ gun registry, even though the bill did the opposite. This legislation, in fact, outlawed any registry. Plain and simple, right there in the text."" The Manchin-Toomey amendment referenced a registry ban already in federal law, then expanded it, prohibiting seizure of records, forbidding the attorney general from consolidating or centralizing records, and providing for fines and imprisonment for anyone who did consolidate or centralize records",True,"April 18, 2013"
"The Manchin-Toomey amendment ""would have criminalized certain private transfers of firearms between honest citizens, requiring lifelong friends, neighbors and some family members"" to get government approval.","Not long after the Senate voted down a bipartisan effort to expand background checks on gun sales, the National Rifle Association released a statement hailing the proposal’s downfall as good news. ""This amendment would have criminalized certain private transfers of firearms between honest citizens, requiring lifelong friends, neighbors and some family members to get federal government permission to exercise a fundamental right or face prosecution. As we have noted previously, expanding background checks, at gun shows or elsewhere, will not reduce violent crime or keep our kids safe in their schools,"" the pro-gun rights group said on April 17, 2013. The amendment, offered by Republican Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and Democrat Joe Manchin of West Virginia, would have required background checks for private sales at gun shows and on the Internet, two areas that are currently exempt from federal law. But it specifically exempted transactions between family members from the background check requirement. So we wondered what circumstances the NRA envisioned that could have ""criminalized certain private transfers of firearms."" What’s in the amendment The Manchin-Toomey amendment stopped short of language in a larger Senate bill on guns, which would have mandated criminal background checks on all sales between private parties with limited exceptions. Current law requires checks on purchases only from federally licensed gun dealers. So the Manchin-Toomey amendment attempted to find middle ground -- expanding the checks to gun shows and Internet sales, but not requiring them of family members and friends giving or selling guns to each other. ""As under current law, transfers between family, friends and neighbors do not require background checks. You can give or sell a gun to your brother, your neighbor, your co-worker without a background check. You can post a gun for sale on the cork bulletin board at your church or your job without a background check,"" a press release from the senators said. The amendment itself specifically said background checks wouldn’t be required of family members if ""the transfer is made between spouses, between parents or spouses of parents and their children or spouses of their children, between siblings or spouses of siblings, or between grandparents or spouses of grandparents and their grandchildren or spouses of their grandchildren, or between aunts or uncles or their spouses and their nieces or nephews or their spouses, or between first cousins, if the transferor does not know or have reasonable cause to believe that the transferee is prohibited from receiving or possessing a firearm under Federal, State, or local law."" ""It’d have to be pretty distant family"" for the background check rule to apply, said Chris Calabrese, legal counsel for the ACLU. As for friends buying and selling guns, no background check was required if the sale was not advertised online or in a publication. So how could such transfers be ""criminalized?"" The amendment required a background check for any advertised sale. So imagine these two circumstances overlapping. ""If I do an advertisement that I’m looking to sell a firearm and then my friend comes and says to me, ‘I’d like to buy a gun,’ then I’d have to do a background check,"" Calabrese said. Same goes for a gun sold to a friend or a family member at a gun show. Calabrese said the ACLU did not oppose the Manchin-Toomey amendment because it made clear what transactions were subject to background checks. ""We didn’t think anybody should inadvertently become a criminal. The criminal laws should be clear in who they apply to so people don’t have a problem understanding and following the law. We think this meets this standard,"" he said. John Frazer, a spokesman for the NRA, described some circumstances ""in which transfers among such people could have been subject to prosecution under the amendment."" He mentioned friends running into each other at a gun show, or someone posting a gun for sale on Facebook and receiving interest from a cousin. If a gun was sold in those circumstances without a background check, ""the transfer would be a crime."" Garen Wintemute, an expert in gun issues who favors more gun control, told PolitiFact that the amendment didn’t go so far as criminalizing private transfers. ""It simply subjected them to new procedural requirements,"" he said in an email. Our ruling The NRA said that the Manchin-Toomey amendment would have ""criminalized certain private transfers of firearms between honest citizens, requiring lifelong friends, neighbors and some family members to get federal government permission to exercise a fundamental right or face prosecution."" The amendment specifically exempted family and friend transfers from the requirement to conduct a criminal background check. But it did extend the requirement to Internet and gun show sales. So only if a friend or family member purchased a gun in one of those settings would the background check requirement kick in. That’s a limited circumstance, to be sure. And as Wintemute argued, it was added a layer of paperwork but did not make familial gun transfers crimes. The NRA’s statement contained an element of truth but was otherwise a big stretch",Mostly False,"April 18, 2013"
"""The NRA used to support expanded background checks.""","
After the Senate failed to advance an amendment that would expand federal requirements for background checks on gun purchasers, President Barack Obama took to the White House’s Rose Garden to denounce the vote, calling it ""a pretty shameful day for Washington."" 
Flanked by relatives of some of the slain children from Newtown, Conn., and assassination survivor Gabby Giffords, Obama emphasized how broadly Americans support expanded background checks for gun purchases. 
At one point, Obama invoked his gun-policy adversary, the National Rifle Association. ""Even the NRA used to support expanded background checks,"" he said. ""The current leader of the NRA"" -- referring to Wayne LaPierre -- ""used to support these background checks."" 
This echoed a similar claim we checked earlier this year. New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg said on NBC’s Meet the Press that ""if you go back to 1999, Wayne LaPierre testified on behalf of the NRA that background checks were appropriate and should be done."" 
We’ll recap what we found when checking the comment Bloomberg made. 
On May 27, 1999, LaPierre testified before the House Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Crime. The Columbine High School shooting, in which 12 high school students and one teacher were murdered, had happened a month earlier. 
To rebut what he saw as a demonization of the NRA and its members, LaPierre listed a number of actions and laws he said were good policy. 
First on that list was this: 
""We think it's reasonable to provide mandatory instant criminal background checks for every sale at every gun show. No loopholes anywhere for anyone,"" he said. ""That means closing the Hinckley loophole so the records of those adjudicated mentally ill are in the system. This isn't new, or a change of position, or a concession. I've been on record on this point consistently, from our national meeting in Denver, to paid national ads and position papers, to news interviews and press appearances."" 
He also spoke in favor of preventing juvenile felons from ever owning guns, setting up instant background checks at gun shows, and keeping schools gun-free. 
There’s additional evidence, too. 
New York magazine, in a January 2013 story, dug up the advertising campaign LaPierre mentioned in his testimony. Titled ""Be reasonable,"" the NRA ads that ran in national newspapers said, ""We think it's reasonable to provide for instant checks at gun shows just like at gun stores and pawn shops. But what's unreasonable is how the proposed Lautenberg legislation ignores the 250,000 prohibited people, like felons, who've walked away from gun stores — instead of being prosecuted for a federal felony for trying to buy a gun."" 
We contacted the NRA for our previous story but did not receive a response. In January, NRA board member Sandy Froman told CNN, ""The NRA has changed its position, and the reason it's changed its position is because the system doesn't work."" 
LaPierre himself acknowledged this change in a January 2013 Senate hearing in the wake of the Newtown, Conn., elementary school shooting. 
""I do not believe the way the law is working now, unfortunately, that it does any good to extend the law to private sales between hobbyists and collectors. … The fact is, the law right now is a failure the way it's working,"" he said. 
Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., then said, ""I understand, back in 1999, you said no loopholes anywhere for anyone. But now you do not support background checks for all buyers of firearms?"" 
LaPierre responded: ""I think the National Instant Check System, the way it's working now, is a failure. Because this administration is not prosecuting the people that they catch. Twenty-three states are not even putting the mental records of those adjudicated mentally incompetent into the system. Now, assume that if you don't prosecute, and they try to buy a gun, even if you catch them, and you let them walk away, to assume they're not going to get a gun -- they're criminals, they're homicidal maniacs, and they're mentally ill. I mean, we all know that homicidal maniacs, criminals and the insane ... don't abide by the law."" 
The NRA’s website on March 12, 2013, posted its firm stance against expanding background checks. 
Our ruling 
In his Rose Garden comments, Obama said ""the NRA used to support expanded background checks."" He’s correct: In congressional testimony following the Columbine High School shooting, LaPierre called it ""reasonable"" to conduct a background check ""for every sale at every gun show. No loopholes anywhere for anyone."" Subsequent statements by NRA officials acknowledge that the group’s position has since changed to opposition to more background checks",True,"April 18, 2013"
"Polls show that Americans ""overwhelmingly"" support ""expanding background checks.""","
Gabrielle Giffords, the former Arizona congresswoman who was shot in the head while meeting with constituents on Jan. 8, 2011, has become a leading advocate for Americans who support tighter restrictions on guns. 
More than two years later, the Senate moved to consider an amendment that would have expanded background checks. But the amendment failed to win the necessary 60 votes to proceed to a final vote. 
The day after the vote, Giffords wrote an op-ed for the New York Times decrying that vote. 
In her op-ed, Giffords wrote, ""Some of the senators who voted against the background-check amendments have met with grieving parents whose children were murdered at Sandy Hook, in Newtown. Some of the senators who voted no have also looked into my eyes as I talked about my experience being shot in the head at point-blank range in suburban Tucson two years ago, and expressed sympathy for the 18 other people shot besides me, 6 of whom died. These senators have heard from their constituents — who polls show overwhelmingly favored expanding background checks. And still these senators decided to do nothing. Shame on them."" 
Under current law, background checks are required in sales made by federally licensed gun dealers, but not for gun sales by private sellers. President Barack Obama wants to require criminal background checks for all gun sales. The National Rifle Association, which opposes universal background checks, argues that an expansion would fail to deter criminals. 
Here, we will check Giffords’ claim that polls show that Americans ""overwhelmingly"" support ""expanding background checks."" 
To do this, we will look at national survey data from media and academic polls taken in the month prior to Giffords’ column. Here’s a rundown of all such polls we could find that addressed an expansion of background checks: 
• Washington Post-ABC News poll, April 11-14, 2013: ""Would you support or oppose a law requiring background checks on people buying guns at gun shows or online?"" Support: 86 percent. Oppose: 13 percent. 
• CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll, April 5-7, 2013: ""Some proposals would require a background check on anyone attempting to purchase a gun in order to determine whether the prospective buyer has been convicted of a felony or has a mental health problem. Please tell me whether you would favor or oppose a background check for a prospective gun buyer under each of the following circumstances. ... If the buyer is trying to purchase a gun at a gun show."" Favor: 83 percent. Oppose: 17 percent. 
""If the buyer is trying to purchase a gun from another person who is not a gun dealer but owns one or more guns and wants to sell one of them."" Favor: 70 percent. Oppose: 29 percent. 
""If the buyer is purchasing a gun from a family member or receiving it as a gift."" Favor: 54 percent. Oppose: 45 percent. 
""Please tell me whether you would favor or oppose a background check for anyone who wants to buy ammunition for a gun."" Favor: 55 percent. Oppose: 44 percent. 
• Quinnipiac University poll, March 26-April 1, 2013. ""Do you support or oppose requiring background checks for all gun buyers?"" Support: 91 percent. Oppose: 8 percent. 
• CBS News poll, March 20-24, 2013. ""Would you favor or oppose background checks on all potential gun buyers?"" Favor: 90 percent. Oppose: 8 percent. 
Giffords’ claim is well-founded, in part because it’s not overly specific: In four polls over the prior month, between 83 percent and 91 percent of respondents said they would favor an expansion of the current background check regime. We think any reasonable person would conclude that those percentages qualify as ""overwhelming."" 
Giffords would have had more trouble finding support for her claim had she either set a numerical threshold or had she been more specific about the kind of background checks Americans are comfortable with. 
For instance, when Obama spoke shortly after the amendment’s failure in the Senate, he cited 90 percent support for an expansion of background checks not once but five times in fairly brief remarks. In the survey results we found, half of the polls crossed that threshold and half did not (though those that didn’t are fairly close). 
Meanwhile, the results of the CNN poll suggest that Americans do not support all possible expansions of background checks to the same extent. Checks at gun shows found 83 percent support, but private sales between a willing seller and a willing buyer garnered 70 percent backing, while checks for transfers to family members or for the purchase of ammunition only reached the mid 50-percent range. 
Our ruling 
In her op-ed, Giffords said polls show that Americans ""overwhelmingly"" support ""expanding background checks."" Four independent polls taken in the previous month showed that some sort of expansion of background checks earned the support of between 83 percent and 91 percent of respondents, a level of backing we think qualifies as ""overwhelming",True,"April 18, 2013"
"Says President Barack Obama ""has allowed, each year he's been here, the prosecutions of gun cases (for background check failures) to go down. ... They've declined every year since President Bush left office.""","
As Congress debates whether to enact new restrictions on firearms, one argument often voiced by opponents is that the federal government should enforce existing gun laws rather than passing new ones, such as a bill now pending that would expand background checks to virtually all gun sales, including gun shows and online sales. 
Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., made this argument on ABC’s This Week with George Stephanopoulos on April 14, 2013. 
Guest host Jonathan Karl asked, ""But very quickly, are you going to be able to defeat the background checks?"" 
Sessions replied, ""I don't think it's going to pass. The president of the United States has allowed, each year he's been here, the prosecutions of gun cases to go down. I was a federal prosecutor. I prosecuted those. He needs to prosecute the laws that we have today. They've declined every year since President Bush left office."" 
We wondered whether that was accurate, so we looked at the data. 
First, we’ll note that we are focusing on the prosecutions arising from background checks, rather than the number of prosecutions of other types of gun crimes, because Sessions’ statement was made in response to a question about background checks. We’ll also ignore prosecutions by state officials, since Sessions’ statement referred to the presidential role, which oversees federal, not state, prosecutorial actions. (Under President Barack Obama, background check denial information has been made available to state and local law enforcement through the National Crime Information Center, the Justice Department said in a statement to PolitiFact.) 
Now, here’s some background on the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. The system, which began operating in 1998, is an automated system that enables a gun seller to instantly check a series of government databases to determine whether a potential purchaser is eligible to buy a gun under federal or state law. 
In recent years, the Justice Department has published annual reports on how many times this system has flagged an ineligible purchaser and whether they were prosecuted. Looking back at these individual reports makes it possible to chart the number of prosecutions over time. Here’s a summary: 
2005: 135 prosecutions 
2006: 112 prosecutions 
2007: 122 prosecutions 
2008: 105 prosecutions 
2009: 77 prosecutions 
2010: 44 prosecutions 
So it’s correct for Sessions to say that prosecutions have ""declined every year"" since President George W. Bush left office. Still, it’s worth pointing out two caveats. 
First, data has not yet been published for the final two years of Obama’s first term. (If history is any guide, the data for 2011 should be published in August 2013.) So the number of prosecutions might have gone up in 2011 and 2012, but we don’t know yet. 
Second, it’s worth noting that even though the raw numbers of prosecutions have declined in recent years, prosecutions consistently represented a tiny proportion of all flagged purchasers under both presidents. Here are the year-by-year totals: 
2005: prosecutions accounted for 0.20 percent of background check denials 
2006: prosecutions accounted for 0.15 percent of background check denials 
2007: prosecutions accounted for 0.16 percent of background check denials 
2008: prosecutions accounted for 0.13 percent of background check denials 
2009: prosecutions accounted for 0.11 percent of background check denials 
2010: prosecutions accounted for 0.06 percent of background check denials 
So the rates have been lower under Obama, but they were already exceedingly low under Bush -- always at or lower than two-tenths of a percent of all denials. 
When Sessions compared the numbers under Obama and Bush, he was effectively blaming Obama for forgoing prosecutions of these types of crimes. He’s right -- but only up to a point. 
The president, as the official in charge of the executive branch, does have the authority to order changes in prosecutorial priorities, and in a broad sense, most administrations do shift prosecutorial goals at the Justice Department based on their own assessment of what issues need heightened attention and enforcement. 
However, while the president can set the tone, any changes need to happen under the direction of the attorney general, and then filter down to the front-line Justice Department attorneys on the case. 
""The president and his staff can create the momentum and certainly set the agenda for the attorney general to follow,"" said Joshua Berman, currently a partner at the law firm Katten Muchin and a former federal prosecutor in the southern district of New York and in Washington. ""It would not be unheard of or improper for the president or the president’s staff to push the department or the attorney general to increase investigations and prosecutions of a particular kind of crime such as cybercrime or gun crimes. ... That being said, there is no way the president is micromanaging that effort."" 
Our ruling 
Sessions said that Obama ""has allowed, each year he's been here, the prosecutions of gun cases to go down. .. They've declined every year since President Bush left office."" That’s true -- but the data covers only the first two years of Obama’s term, and it didn’t nosedive under Obama since it was already a tiny percentage under Bush. Obama could order tougher prosecution of gun-denial cases, but like his predecessors, he or his appointees have determined that other crimes are more urgent and take precedence",Half True,"April 16, 2013"
"Says a gun bill before the Senate would make it a federal felony to ""leave town for more than seven days, and leave someone else at home with your firearms.""","
As gun legislation works its way through the U.S. Senate, gun rights groups warn that some proposals in the original bill could create accidental felons. 
One such email warning, from an Arizona group, says, ""You would be committing a federal felony if you leave town for more than seven days, and leave someone else at home with your firearms."" 
Could hosting a house-sitter become a crime? Could your unsuspecting roommates face a felony? 
The bill, known as the Safe Communities, Safe Schools Act of 2013, faces votes on a series of amendments, most prominently one proposed by Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Pat Toomey, R-Pa. 
So all bets are off on the bill’s final language. 
Still, as the debate unfolds, we were curious: Does Senate Bill 649 make felons of vacationing gun owners with roommates or house guests? 
Gun transfers 
As introduced in the Senate in March, S. 649 requires background checks for all gun sales, with a limited set of exceptions. 
And it’s not just sales that are subject to the law — but gun ""transfers."" In general, it would be illegal to give your gun to someone else without seeking a federal background check. 
But there are a series of exceptions that seek to loosen the requirement in some situations — for example, handing your gun to a friend at a shooting range or while hunting legally together, giving a gun as a gift to a close relative or leaving a gun in a will. 
It’s also okay under the bill to lend your gun to someone in your own home or yard — as long as that ""temporary transfer"" lasts less than seven days. 
Thus, the issue raised by the Arizona Citizens Defense League. 
""While the proposed legislation contains limited exceptions for transfers such as between family members,"" says the email, sent to supporters April 10, ""a little digging shows that you would be committing a federal felony if you ...  leave town for more than seven days, and leave someone else at home with your firearms."" 
So, what happens if a buddy house-sits or a roommate stays home during your eight-day vacation? 
The answer: It would likely depend on the circumstances. 
""I would say it should be changed to ‘you might be committing a federal felony if you leave town for more than seven days, and leave someone else at home with your firearms,’"" said Clark Neily, who helped represent security guard Dick Heller in his successful Supreme Court challenge to D.C.’s handgun ban. 
If you locked up your guns and expressly forbade others from using them, you would have a pretty good argument that you hadn’t transferred possession, attorneys told us. 
But say your weapons were available to guests or roommates — that nothing would prevent them from using your guns while you were out of town. Then you might have a problem. 
The federal government tends to have an expansive definition of ""possession,"" under various laws, Neily said. 
""I would say there is a real possibility that someone could be convicted under S. 649 for leaving town for more than seven days while someone else is at home with their guns,"" he said. 
Still, a house guest’s mere ""access"" to your weapons wouldn’t necessarily qualify as possession, said Larry Rosenthal, a law professor at Chapman University School of Law who has worked as a federal prosecutor and argued before the Supreme Court as an attorney for the City of Chicago. 
He pointed to a 2012 case decided by the U.S. Court of Appeals’ Seventh Circuit, United States vs. Griffin, in which a felon had been convicted of illegally possessing firearms and ammunition because he lived with his dad, who had hunting gear around the house. 
The court overturned the conviction, explaining the government’s argument ""confuses access with possession,"" Rosenthal said. 
Meanwhile, just staying in a home with weapons — especially if the house-sitter or roommate didn’t know they were there — wouldn’t plausibly qualify as a ""transfer"" of a firearm, Rosenthal said. There would have to be a ""knowing passage of control."" 
So leaving your roommate home alone for weeks, oblivious to the shotgun under your bed, likely wouldn’t violate the bill’s provisions. 
Our ruling 
An Arizona group says a gun bill before the Senate would make it a federal felony to ""leave town for more than seven days, and leave someone else at home with your firearms."" 
Indeed, S. 649, as introduced in the Senate, allows for ""temporary transfers"" of guns in your own home that last less than seven days. But leaving a house-sitter or roommate with access to weapons while you’re away for a longer stretch, attorneys explained to PolitiFact, could raise the possibility of violating federal law under the bill’s provisions. Still, experts told us a gun owner might avoid such a consequence by locking up weapons and denying permission to use them. And it’s not clear courts would interpret mere access as a transfer of possession. 
The claim is just partially accurate",Half True,"April 16, 2013"
"Says a gun bill before the Senate ""is proposing the universal registration of all firearms and their owners.""","
Just what’s in that new gun bill under debate in the Senate? 
Opponents would love to tell you all about it. 
""Stop Federal Universal Firearms Registration!"" says the subject line of an email from an Arizona group this week. 
The message urges readers to contact their senators, warning: ""In reality S. 649 is proposing the universal registration of all firearms and their owners."" 
The bill, known as the Safe Communities, Safe Schools Act of 2013, would make all gun sales subject to the nation’s background check laws, with limited exceptions. 
Does it propose universal firearm registration? 
Background checks and registries 
We read the bill, and consulted experts, including legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, attorneys who helped represent security guard Dick Heller in his successful Supreme Court challenge to D.C.’s handgun ban, and the spokesperson for the Arizona Citizens Defense League. 
The bill would require ""a background check for every firearm sale"" — or transfer of ownership — with a few exceptions, such as for certain family members. Right now, federal background checks are only required for sales through licensed gun dealers. 
Here’s how background checks work. 
The FBI maintains the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. 
When you buy a gun from a federally licensed dealer, you fill out a form with personally identifying information. The dealer uses the NICS to match that information with various records to make sure you’re not, for example, a felon who’s not allowed to own a weapon. It’s a computerized process that’s only supposed to take about 30 seconds, but in the case of an unclear match, can take up to three days. 
If you’re cleared to purchase a gun, the government is required to destroy all identifying information about you before the next business day. Instead, the dealer is required to store the form. 
That’s right: Federal law requires destruction of records and bans creation of a federal gun registry. 
Does S. 649, sponsored by Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., change that? 
Several attorneys we spoke to said no, it didn’t — it leaves those provisions in place. More people would be subject to background checks, but a federal database of that information would remain as illegal as ever. 
But Chris Calabrese, legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, says the language of the bill leaves a door open for a new kind of record of sales between private sellers — as opposed to sales by federally licensed gun dealers — a record that may not be subject to the registry ban. 
""We have a real fear with this particular legislative language that this would result in new records being created,"" he said. 
He points to a legal phrase in the bill — ""notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter"" — as perhaps allowing creation and, later, collection of those records, even though existing law rules out ""a system of registration of firearms, firearms owners, or firearms transactions or dispositions."" 
So, even if there’s no intent to create such a loophole in the registry ban, the law doesn’t explicitly rule it out, he argues. 
Call it the possibility of a partial registry. 
""I don't think it's a crazy idea to say that if the records exist, there would be a push to use them for other things,""  Calabrese said. 
He contrasts the bill’s vague language with an amendment proposed by Sens. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., and Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., that would explicitly bar any such registry and adds the possibility of up to 15 years in prison for violators. 
But even if the federal government created a new type of record for gun sales between private sellers — and tracked them — that wouldn’t be ""universal registration of all firearms and their owners,"" as suggested by the Arizona group’s email message. 
""There are at least 300 million guns in private ownership in America today, and I am not aware of any provision of S. 649 that would require the registration of those guns or assist the federal government in determining precisely who owns them,"" said Clark Neily, who was co-counsel to Dick Heller in District of Columbia vs. Heller. 
(Still, he said, mentioning the ACLU’s worry, the Arizona email ""touches upon a genuine concern."") 
So what does the Arizona Citizens Defense League say about its claim that the bill ""is proposing the universal registration of all firearms and their owners""? 
Essentially, that the government will violate its own rules against keeping background check records. 
""This is where background knowledge of the issue is so important, and goes WAY beyond what is written in statute,"" said Charles Heller, a radio host and spokesperson for the Arizona Citizens Defense League. (He’s no relation to Dick Heller.) 
He says the FBI’s NICS system could illegally store results of all background checks. 
""This is simply a method to herd all transfers to being ‘on record,’ for later confiscation,"" he said. 
But the email message didn’t say the law would make it easier for the federal government to create an illegal gun registry. It said: 
""The true subject of S. 649 is the requirement to report all firearms transfers to the federal government via ‘universal background checks.’ In reality S. 649 is proposing the universal registration of all firearms and their owners. As history has repeatedly shown us, and is currently being demonstrated in New York, registration is the prelude to confiscation."" 
That’s simply not what the bill proposes. 
Robert Levy, the chairman of the board of directors of the libertarian Cato Institute, was in his own words, ""a vigorous advocate for the right to possess firearms for self-defense"" as co-counsel to Dick Heller in District of Columbia vs. Heller. 
He acknowledges the concern that expanding background checks creates a data trail that Americans must trust is being destroyed in a timely way by the federal government. 
Still, he says, ""it's incorrect to assert that S. 649 is proposing the universal registration of all firearms and their owners."" 
Our ruling 
An email circulated to Arizona residents claims a bill before the Senate ""is proposing the universal registration of all firearms and their owners."" The bill expands background checks to most gun transfers. But federal rules forbid the government from keeping a record of successful background checks for more than a day. The ACLU argues it’s possible the bill creates a new type of record for some sales that may not be subject to the ban, but that’s not the same thing as ""universal registration of all firearms and their owners",False,"April 16, 2013"
"""Harvard Study Finds States With Most Gun Laws Have Fewest Gun Deaths.""","
Does having more gun laws in a state result in fewer gun deaths? You would think so if you've seen the recent Facebook posting, created by a group called Anti-Republican Crusaders and shared more than 1,700 times on that and another Facebook page. 
The posting has the Joe Friday character from TV's ""Dragnet"" saying, ""Just the facts, ma'am,"" followed by this headline: ""Harvard Study Finds States With Most Gun Laws Have Fewest Gun Deaths."" 
There's also a color-coded U.S. map showing the states with the most laws and fewest deaths. 
We wondered if the Harvard study did, in fact, prove that point. 
The Facebook posts send readers to a study published online by JAMA Internal Medicine (not the Journal of the American Medical Association, a separate medical journal, as the post reports). The team led by Eric Fleegler of Harvard and Boston Children's Hospital created a ""legislative strength score"" to gauge which states had more gun laws. Then they compared that to the state-by-state firearms death rate. 
The more gun laws a state had, the lower the rate. 
That may sound conclusive, but there's a huge caveat. As the researchers concluded: ""Our study could not determine cause-and-effect relationships."" 
There could be many other factors, such as the rate of gun ownership or a state’s culture of gun ownership.. 
Curious Facebook readers might have uncovered this if they followed a link to an interview with Fleegler conducted by Robin Young on the March 13, 2013, edition of ""Here & Now,"" the news program produced by WBUR in Boston. Young zeroed in on the same problem, asking if the relevant factor could be a state's gun culture. 
Fleegler acknowledged the point. ""[It] may be true that there are states [where people] don't own a lot of guns, they're OK with passing legislation [and] they have lower rates of firearm deaths,"" he said. 
Dr. Garen Wintemute of the University of California-Davis School of Medicine, was even blunter in a commentary that JAMA Internal Medicine released at the same time. 
When the Fleegler team took into account the amount of gun ownership, ""the association between firearm laws and firearm fatalities essentially disappeared,"" he wrote. 
Another key shortcoming of the study: The scorecard used to assess how many laws a state has ""does not account for variations between states in the specifics of their laws and includes no measure of whether or how effectively the states enforce them."" 
Wintemute noted that while gun laws were almost certainly enacted to reduce criminal violence, their real impact was a reduction in suicide, which ""accounted for 94 percent of the observed decrease in firearm-related mortality."" 
Fleegler, in his ""Here & Now"" interview, noted that suicide was a key factor because when people think of killing themselves, the presence of a gun means they will succeed 85 percent of the time compared to close to 2 percent when they don't have a firearm available. 
In the end, when the Facebook posting says ""Harvard Study Finds States With Most Gun Laws Have Fewest Gun Deaths,"" it is correctly summarizing one finding of the study. But it leaves out important details and context that argue against the idea that reducing gun deaths is simply a matter of blindly passing more gun laws in each state",Half True,"April 10, 2013"
"Air travelers ""can’t get on a plane in the United States without someone doing a background check"" on them.","
Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy, whose state is still mourning the massacre of 20 first-graders and six adults at an elementary school, is pushing for a federal expansion of background checks on gun purchases. 
In an interview on MSNBC, Malloy cited strong public support for expanded checks and claimed that another, more pedestrian area of American life is more tightly controlled than weapon transfers. 
""I’m a governor. I can’t get on a plane in the United States without someone doing a background check on me, but I could go places in this country and buy a weapon and not have that done. It makes no sense to anybody, quite frankly,"" he said. 
We wondered if that’s true -- that air travelers are subject to background checks, and how it compares with the requirements on gun purchases. 
First, guns. Federal law requires federally licensed gun dealers to conduct background checks before selling a firearm. There is no federal law that requires private gun dealers -- such as those selling at gun shows -- to do such background checks. Gun control advocates want the background check requirement expanded to cover those and other private purchases. 
According to federal figures, applicants who are denied a firearm through the FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System are rejected for having a prior criminal conviction or restraining order, being a fugitive from justice or in the United States illegally, being under indictment or having been dishonorably discharged from the military. Others are denied because they failed to acknowledge their record on the initial form. 
So what’s required of air travelers? 
Malloy’s spokeswoman, Juliet Manalan, told us that Malloy was referring to the Secure Flight program, created in response to the 9/11 Commission’s recommendation of uniform pre-screening of passenger information against government watch lists. 
The program, run by the Transportation Security Administration, requires airline passengers to provide their name, date of birth and gender to be matched against watch lists including the ""no fly"" list. That list, which is classified, contains the names of suspected terrorists who are barred from boarding planes flying in or out of the United States. It does not bar felons or other convicted criminals from flying. 
""In short: there is a list that prevents people from boarding a plane, but no list that prevents people who shouldn’t have firearms from purchasing them,"" Manalan said. 
So there’s a list, but is there a background check? 
Not exactly, and not a criminal one.  
 ""Passengers names are checked against the no-fly and selectee list via the Secure Flight process, but they do not undergo the fingerprint-based criminal history record check/security threat assessment process that airport/airline employees undergo,"" said Jeffrey Price, an aerospace professor at Metropolitan State University of Denver. 
Douglas Laird, an independent aviation security expert, called it a stretch to describe the airline procedure as a background check. 
""TSA runs the data received from the airlines computer reservations systems through various databases, but this is not a background check by any stretch of the imagination,"" Laird said. 
Still, there is a definite security element to the airlines’ process. 
""It is basic information, but the airlines could use it for a background check. I believe that is what (Malloy) is trying to say,"" said Clifford Winston, an economist with the centrist Brookings Institution. ""I don’t think it is the case that before you can buy a ticket, you have to undergo a background check."" 
Henry Harteveldt, a travel industry analyst with the advisory firm Hudson Crossing, added, ""It may not be a true ‘background check,’ but passenger data is passed through a database (possibly more than one) to detect possible terrorists."" 
Our ruling 
Malloy said he ""can’t get on a plane in the United States without someone doing a background check on me,"" while less oversight exists for gun purchases. 
Background checks on gun purchases -- which assess a person’s criminal history -- do not apply to the private transfer of weapons, only to purchases from licensed gun dealers. And it’s true that many guns are bought legally with no background check. 
But the Secure Flight program does not check people’s legal history in the same way. It compares passenger information with lists of suspected terrorists. It’s a security measure, but not a true background check. Though unlike with guns, it applies to everyone. 
Malloy’s statement is only partially accurate",Half True,"April 9, 2013"
"Says in Chicago, ""we take more guns off the streets than New York or L.A.""","New York and Los Angeles beat out Chicago as the nation’s most populous cities. But Chicago has more guns on the streets, Mayor Rahm Emanuel told CNN. That was his answer when CNN host Jake Tapper asked on April 2, 2013: With some of the nation’s strictest gun laws, why are your homicide rates still so high? Without uniform gun policies — say, in neighboring Indiana and Wisconsin — weapons still flow, Emanuel said. ""We take more guns off the streets than New York or L.A.,"" he said. Emanuel, who formerly was President Barack Obama's  White House chief of staff, is part of a group of mayors that’s fighting for stricter national gun laws. We were curious: Does America’s No. 3 most populous city take No. 1 in gun seizures? Chicago’s guns We talked with Bill McCaffrey, a spokesman in Emanuel’s office. He said the city uses the comparison with New York and Los Angeles to demonstrate that Chicago’s strict gun control rules won’t work by themselves. (Opponents of gun control measures argue the city offers evidence that such laws don’t work, period.) New York and California both have stricter gun control laws than Illinois. Guns cross into Chicago not just from Indiana and Wisconsin, but from areas right outside the city. ""Chicago is not an island,"" McCaffrey said. In the first six months of last year, the city — not counting gun buybacks or turn-ins — seized 3,912 guns. That’s as many as New York and Los Angeles combined, according to the University of Chicago Crime Lab, which got numbers from the cities’ police departments. In Chicago, police picked up illegal weapons at crime scenes and traffic stops, found them with search warrants and investigations, or heard about them when people called 911 to report a ""man with a gun"" or ""shots fired."" In the same months that Chicago recovered 3,912 guns, Los Angeles got 2,296 and New York 1,385. That wasn’t an anomaly, according to Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, who has testified before Congress in favor of strengthening federal measures to reduce gun trafficking. For several years under the Clinton administration, an effort to fight youth crime collected gun-tracing data for major U.S. cities. ""I can tell you that Chicago consistently recovered more guns than any of the other cities, N.Y.C. and L.A. included,"" Webster said. We pulled those reports from 1998, 1999 and 2000. Chicago recovered and traced more guns than either New York or Los Angeles in all three years. In 1998, it picked up 16,222 weapons — more than the two larger cities together. Why? Webster points out that the city has a lot of gangs, and gangs and guns go together. Its police department cracks down on illegal gun possession, making arrests more likely. And Illinois gun control laws aren’t nearly as strong as those in New York and California in deterring gun trafficking into the city, he said. Webster told House Democrats in March that studies show state gun laws are undermined by gaps in federal law — people buy guns in states with the weakest laws to sell in states with the toughest laws. The same idea works for counties and cities. In Chicago, all it takes is a drive outside the city limits, the New York Times reported, such as to Chuck’s Gun Shop in Riverdale, Ill., the source of more than 1,300 weapons seized in Chicago since 2008. The same store was identified as a key source of crime guns in a New York Times piece in 1999. Our ruling Emanuel, arguing for stronger federal laws to help Chicago tamp down on gun crime, said, ""we take more guns off the streets than New York or L.A."" Gun seizure data gathered by the University of Chicago Crime Lab and a federal youth crime initiative show just that",True,"April 9, 2013"
"The city of Nelson, Ga., is ""quieter than Mayberry.""","
The headline says it all: ""Moving to Nelson? Pack a gun."" 
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution ran that front-page story this month about the small town of Nelson, Ga, located 54 miles north of Atlanta. The story chronicled how the town’s council recently passed a law requiring the head of every household to own a gun and bullets. 
Local leaders say the law was meant as a security measure. But it also made a strong statement about possible federal gun restrictions. 
In discussing the town and his support of the new law, Nelson’s police chief, B. Heath Mitchell, noted that Nelson was a place full of good, law-abiding folks. In fact, ""we’re quieter than Mayberry,"" he said. 
OK, OK, the chief was using a bit of poetic license here. But since he compared his town to one of the best-known locales on the planet -- even if it is just a too-good-to-be-true TV town -- we thought we’d go ahead and give it a spin in the AJC Truth-O-Meter. PolitiFact Georgia decided to ""nip it, nip it in the bud"" once and for all. 
And anyway,  a fact check that requires watching episodes of ""The Andy Griffith Show"" is one we couldn’t pass up. 
Nelson has become a media magnet ever since the town passed the gun law. Requests for comment came from as far as Germany and the United Kingdom. Nationally, the story has been picked up by CNN, Fox News and the Huffington Post.  
Nelson’s new law is similar to a 1982 law passed in Kennesaw, Ga. Like Kennesaw, Nelson ultimately has no intention of enforcing the law, but hopes to send a message to possible criminals, council members said.  
""If you plan on doing us harm, we’ll be armed,"" said a Nelson city leader. 
We checked in with Chief Mitchell about crime in Nelson and its similarities to fictional Mayberry.  Nelson straddles the counties of Pickens and Cherokee, and was once home to a thriving marble industry. The city has produced marble for headstones at Arlington National Cemetery, and for building the Lincoln Memorial and the U.S. Capitol. 
Mitchell describes the city as a Norman Rockwell painting with so few crimes that the crime rate is too low to calculate. ""It’s quiet, just the way I like it,"" he said. 
In fact, Nelson is smaller than Mayberry. Nelson’s 2.5 square miles include a population of just 1,314 residents, according to the 2000 census. Mayberry’s population is 5,360, according to the opening scene of a sign posted at the railroad station in a Season 8 episode. 
The fictional Mayberry was said to be based on the actual town of Mount Airy, N.C., hometown of lead actor Andy Griffith. Griffith starred in the 1960s sitcom as the town’s sheriff, and Don Knotts played his bumbling deputy, Barney Fife. Andy didn’t carry a gun, and Barney was allowed just one bullet, which Andy made him carry in his shirt pocket as a safety precaution. 
In Nelson, Mitchell is the only lawman in town. When he takes a vacation, the job falls to the sheriff’s offices in Pickens and Cherokee counties. The town is budgeted for two more cops, Mitchell said, but they haven’t been hired yet. What crime Nelson does have is of the small-time variety, mainly burglaries. The last murder happened five years ago, and the suspect has fled to Mexico, according to the chief. 
Most of Nelson’s time is taken up with traffic control. 
Back in Mayberry, the crime report looks pretty similar. We watched a Season 2 episode, ""Sheriff Barney,"" for more information. In that episode, we find out that Mayberry has held the distinction of having the lowest crime rate in the state for three years running. In that episode, the major crime is said to be a resident operating an illegal moonshine still in the mountains. Andy and Barney have been looking for the still for weeks. Eventually the moonshiner, Rafe Hollister, comes to the jail and turns himself in, saying it was only a matter of time before Andy and Barney would catch him anyway. With that kind of self-policing, who needs guns. 
Actual crime numbers for the two towns are hard to find. The FBI’s Uniform Crime Reports only provide crime statistics on cities with populations over 100,000, so Nelson is not covered in this data, and the city doesn’t seem to have reported any data. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation only provides statewide crime rates, not those for local jurisdictions. As for unofficial data, real estate website Sperling’s Best Places gives Nelson a rank of 2 on a 1-to-10, lowest-to-highest scale for property and violent crime. The U.S. average for that website ranking is 4. 
Two other ""Andy Griffith Show"" episodes mention Mayberry’s low crime. One calls Mayberry the most crime-free town in the country, but there aren’t any episodes detailing offenses.  
PolitiFact Georgia did some checking to see if Nelson was on any list of the safest cities in America. 
Golly, nothing there. 
Plano, Texas, listed by Forbes as having the lowest crime rate in the nation, has a violent crime rate of 0.17 per 1,000 residents. Its population is about 262,000. The north Fulton municipality of Milton, listed as the nation’s 39th safest city on one website, averages one murder a year. 
Towns comparing themselves to Mayberry is nothing new, said Jim Clark, head of the 20,000-member ""Andy Griffith Show"" Rerun Watchers Club. ""People understand Mayberry as being the touchstone of wholesomeness with quiet, gentle life,"" Clark said. Even when the Vietnam War and racial tensions erupted in the real world, ""The Andy Griffith Show"" provided a place of escape with Mayberry where Opie (Andy’s TV son) was still doing kid things and Aunt Bee was making homemade apple pies. 
""But if you’ve got a low-crime town, you probably don’t need to arm every resident,"" Clark said. ""It doesn’t seem like a necessary thing to do for peacekeeping purposes."" 
So does Mitchell’s claim get renewed for another season? 
The Nelson police chief said his town was quieter than Mayberry. Both small towns have limited crime and a limited police presence. Nelson is such a small town that its crime statistics are not reported by the FBI or GBI; and ""The Andy Griffith Show"" didn’t detail crime stats. 
One major difference in the towns: Mayberry’s officers made a point of fighting crime with words, not guns. Andy didn’t even carry one. Nelson’s leaders opted for an entirely different style of governance by requiring each head of household to own a firearm and bullets.  
Many small cities with low crime, such as Nelson, liken themselves to Mayberry. But living up to the extremely high standards set by that fictitious town is almost impossible",Half True,"April 8, 2013"
Says 90 percent of Americans and 74 percent of National Rifle Association members support background checks of gun purchasers.,"
Joining calls for criminal background checks prior to every U.S. gun purchase, Austin Mayor Lee Leffingwell said the idea is widely popular. 
Ninety percent of Americans and 74 percent of National Rifle Association members support universal background checks, Leffingwell said, the Austin American-Statesman reported in a news article posted online the day he spoke, March 28, 2013. 
Currently, background checks are required in sales by federally licensed gun dealers but not for gun sales by private sellers. President Barack Obama wants to require criminal background checks for all gun sales. The National Rifle Association, which opposes universal background checks, has suggested that an expansion would fail to rope in criminals. 
As noted in a January 2013 fact check by our colleagues in Washington, Republican pollster Frank Luntz’s organization, Luntz Global, conducted a May 2012 poll of 945 gun owners nationwide, half of whom were gun owners who were ""current or lapsed"" members of the National Rifle Association and half of whom were non-NRA gun owners. It had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. 
Leffingwell aide Amy Everhart said by email that the mayor based his NRA reference on the same poll, as cited by the group that commissioned it,  Mayors Against Illegal Guns. Everhart said Leffingwell also drew his conclusion about other polls from the group, which consists of city mayors concerned with illegal guns and gun violence as helmed by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, an independent, and Boston Mayor Thomas Menino, a Democrat. Its five Texas members include Leffingwell as well as the mayor of neighboring West Lake Hills, Dave Claunch, and Houston Mayor Annise Parker. 
A week before Leffingwell spoke, Everhart pointed out, Bloomberg delivered remarks in New York noting that polls in 41 congressional districts suggest an average of 86 percent to 89 percent of likely voters support universal background checks. ""That’s in line with other recent polls that have found that more than 90 percent of Americans support background checks for all gun buyers,"" Bloomberg said before revisiting the May 2012 poll that reached current and former NRA members. 
That poll found that 82 percent of gun owners were in favor of required background checks, including 74 percent of individuals with current or former memberships in the NRA. 
  
Contacted previously by PolitiFact, the NRA offered no comment on the poll. But the group previously reacted to a 2009 poll taken by Luntz for the mayors’ group by noting that Luntz could not have had access to the association’s confidential membership roll. It also criticized Luntz, a widely quoted communications consultant for Republican politicians and Fortune 100 companies, with decade-old criticism from two polling organizations. The association did not directly challenge the poll results. 
PolitiFact identified two other 2013 polls of gun owners. A Pew Research Center poll taken of 1,502 adults from Jan. 9-13, 2013, found 85 percent of some 529 polled gun owners in favor of making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks — nearly identical to the Luntz poll. The gun-owner results had a margin of error of plus or minus 5 percentage points. A CBS/New York Times poll conducted of 1,110 adults from Jan. 11-15, 2013, showed that 85 percent of respondents living in a household with an NRA member supported universal background checks. 
More recently, according to the results of a national January 2013 poll presented in the March 21, 2013, New England Journal of Medicine, 84 percent of gun owners and 74 percent of NRA members supported requiring a universal background-check system for all gun sales. The poll was conducted by GfK Knowledge Networks for researchers led by Colleen L. Barry, an associate professor of health policy and management at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. 
And what of Americans in general? 
The January Pew poll found 85 percent of all respondents in favor of making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks, with comparable support from Republicans, Democrats and independents, Pew said. The margin of error for the entire sample was 2.9 percentage points. 
The CBS/New York Times poll indicated that 92 percent of all the respondents favor background checks for all potential gun buyers. The poll had an overall margin of error of three percentage points. 
PolitiFact Georgia, looking into a similar claim about support for universal checks, noted a Fox News poll conducted Jan. 15-17, 2013, of 1,008 registered voters. Ninety one percent of respondents said they favor ""requiring criminal background checks on all gun buyers, including those buying at gun shows and private sales."" 
A Quinnipiac University national survey of 772 registered voters, taken Jan. 30 through Feb. 4, 2013, found 92 percent supporting background checks for all gun buyers. The survey, pointed out by Everhart, had a margin of error of 2.3 percentage points. 
A subsequent Quinnipiac University survey, taken of 1,944 registered voters from Feb. 27, 2013 through March 4, 2013, found 88 percent in favor of background checks for all gun buyers. The poll had a margin of error of 2.2 percentage points. 
Our ruling 
Austin’s mayor said 90 percent of Americans and 74 percent of National Rifle Association members support universal background checks for gun purchases. 
Polls taken in 2012 and 2013 support both figures, though one taken closest to Leffingwell’s press conference indicates support among all Americans possibly slipping a bit below 90 percent. Also, the 2012 poll he cited for NRA members rolled together responses of current and former/lapsed members. Then again, a 2013 poll similarly suggests that 74 percent of NRA members favor universal background checks",True,"April 4, 2013"
"Says ""94 percent of (Marco Rubio's) constituents support a universal background check.""","
Former astronaut Mark Kelly, the husband of Arizona shooting victim Gabby Giffords, said that while ""gun control"" doesn’t poll very well, there’s ""incredible momentum"" to pass a universal background check law. 
Never mind five Republican senators, including Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who say that they’re going to filibuster any new ""Second Amendment restrictions."" 
""I would say to Marco Rubio that 94 percent of his constituents support a universal background check,"" Kelly told Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace on March 31, 2013. 
National polls this year show strong support for universal background checks, from Pew Research Center’s 85 percent to Quinnipiac University’s 92 percent. 
We wondered, is it true that 94 percent of Floridians —who share their state with NRA superlobbyist Marion Hammer and a Stand Your Ground law — favor universal background checks? 
The polls 
We reached out to Kelly and Gifford’s advocacy group, Americans for Responsible Solutions, but didn’t immediately hear back. 
Still, we quickly found a poll supporting Kelly’s ""94 percent"" figure. 
It came from a group co-chaired by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Mayors Against Illegal Guns. The February survey of 600 voters was conducted by the polling firm of Democratic consultant Doug Schoen. 
We wouldn’t call that an independent survey. 
However, Quinnipiac University conducted state surveys in March. And its poll of 1,000 registered voters found 91 percent support for universal background checks. 
The question: ""Do you favor or oppose requiring background checks for all gun buyers?"" 
That also supports Kelly’s ""94 percent"" claim — within the Quinnipiac poll’s 3.1 percentage point margin of error. 
It’s also decent evidence that Floridians are in line with the country on expanding background checks from just sales by federally licensed dealers to sales between private sellers, sometimes referred to as closing the ""gun show loophole"" or ""private seller loophole."" 
Even among Florida Republicans, the Quinnipiac poll showed 87 percent support. 
Rubio hasn’t been so clear. 
In January, he gave an interview that made it sound like he was open to universal checks. (""I think you'll find support for that so long as there's not a public database that people can look up and see who owns what guns and where they live."") 
Then his spokesman clarified he wasn’t. (""Expanding it to private sales is problematic because you are asking an individual to conduct a background check on another individual. That is expensive and hard to do, and he does not support that."") 
His most recent statement doesn’t endorse background checks and opposes ""new Second Amendment restrictions.""

Kelly said ""94 percent of (Rubio's) constituents support a universal background check."" A major state poll conducted in March shows 91 percent of Florida voters favor requiring checks ""for all gun buyers."" Kelly’s claim is within the poll’s margin of error",True,"April 2, 2013"
"""In 2011 alone, 269 New Jerseyans were killed by gun violence.""","
More than 250 people in New Jersey died in 2011 because of a weapon, according to Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver. 
And it’s not just any weapon, either, she said in a Feb. 21 opinion piece that appeared in The Times Of Trenton. The column published the day the state Assembly voted on a 22-bill package of gun-control measures. 
""In 2011 alone, 269 New Jerseyans were killed by gun violence,"" Oliver (D-Essex) wrote. 
Assembly Democrats spokeswoman Jennifer Scortino said Oliver’s statistic comes from the FBI’s annual Uniform Crime Report for 2011. We verified its accuracy. 
New Jersey, however, didn’t have the highest number of deaths in 2011 resulting from gun violence. That title goes to California, at 1,220 murders. California was one of 12 states with a higher number of gun-related deaths in 2011 than New Jersey. 
Complete FBI data for 2012 is not yet available, but we also looked at the number of gun-violence deaths dating to 2005. 
The data shows that gun-violence deaths in New Jersey have fluctuated through the years. Prior to 2011, New Jersey had 246 gun-violence deaths in 2010; 220 in 2009; 236 in 2008; 260 in 2007; 289 in 2006; and 276 in 2005, according to annual UCR reports. 
Let’s review some background on how the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reports works. More than 18,000 law enforcement agencies from across the country voluntarily report crime data to the FBI, which then compiles volume and rate of crime offenses for the nation, states and many cities and counties, according to FBI.gov. It also includes arrest, clearance and law enforcement employee data. 
But the FBI isn't the only agency that tracks data involving weapons. We also checked mortality data with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Center for Health Statistics. 
For 2010, the latest data available, New Jersey had 456 deaths resulting from injuries caused by firearms, a spokesman said. Of that number, 246 incidents were assaults by unspecified firearms; 11 were assaults by rifles and larger firearms; 181 were suicides; and 18 were other categories involving firearms. 
Oliver noted in her column that the bills package was not a knee-jerk response to the December 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., but one that resulted after lengthy discussions about other mass shootings around the country as well as efforts to close loopholes in existing gun laws. 
""Our comprehensive package promotes common-sense measures without infringing on the Second Amendment rights enshrined in our Constitution,"" Oliver wrote. ""By keeping dangerous weapons off of our streets, cracking down on illegal gun trafficking and addressing mental health issues and school security, we can stop these tragedies from becoming all too common."" 
Although the Assembly passed the bill, Republicans pointed to flaws in the bills package and accused Democrats of rushing the bills through to gain a political advantage with Gov. Chris Christie and the Legislature up for re-election this year. 
""This is simply a way for the Democrats to find a wedge issue in a year when they can’t find a wedge issue,"" Assembly Minority Leader Jon Bramnick (R-Union) said before the votes were taken. 
Our ruling 
Oliver said in a column that published the day the state Assembly voted on a package of gun-control bills that ""in 2011 alone, 269 New Jerseyans were killed by gun violence."" 
The FBI’s annual Uniform Crime Report for 2011 – the most up-to-date year of complete crime data – verifies that number. It’s worth noting, however, that 12 other states had more deaths attributed to gun violence than New Jersey that year",True,"March 31, 2013"
"Says New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg says ""we can only have three bullets"" and ""the NRA wants firearms with nukes on them.""","
Who makes ""ridiculous"" claims about guns? 
The other side, of course. 
National Rifle Association executive vice president Wayne LaPierre appeared on Meet the Press on March 24, 2013, after New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg.  
""It’s insane the stuff he says,"" LaPierre said of Bloomberg, a co-chair of Mayors Against Illegal Guns who’s spending millions on ads in support of stricter gun controls. 
""We have people all over, millions of people, sending us $5, $10, $15, $20 checks saying stand up to this guy that says we can only have three bullets, which is what he said,"" LaPierre told host David Gregory. ""Stand up to this guy who says ridiculous things like the NRA wants firearms with nukes on them."" 
We wondered: Did Bloomberg say ""we can only have three bullets"" and ""the NRA wants firearms with nukes on them""? 
‘Three bullets’ 
We asked Bloomberg’s office and the NRA about LaPierre’s comments, and searched news databases and the Web. 
We didn’t find evidence that Bloomberg said ""we can only have three bullets."" 
He publicly endorses a ban on ""military-style assault weapons"" and ""high-capacity ammunition magazines,"" such as in a Feb. 11, 2013 letter to lawmakers from Mayors Against Illegal Guns. 
Generally, that’s meant opposition to magazines that hold more than 10 rounds, the target of legislation making its way through Congress. 
Other folks in favor of stricter gun control have argued that magazines with more than three rounds ought to be banned, such as Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., in a December interview on MSNBC. 
Has Bloomberg? Close. But not quite. 
The NRA pointed us to a Nightline interview on Dec. 20, 2012, in which the mayor says if you need more than three bullets, you’re a lousy shot. 
Anchor Cynthia McFadden asked him about the challenge of defining an ""assault weapon."" 
""Well, if it can fire a lot of bullets very quickly, that's a good place to start, okay, and then you can argue about what a lot is,"" Bloomberg said. 
McFadden starts to interject, and the mayor continues: 
""Let's pick it. Let's say three. If you haven't hit the deer with three shots, you're a pretty lousy shot. The deer deserves to get away. Let's get serious here."" 
Later, he says: 
""If it's 30 bullets, or 20 bullets or 10 bullets before you run out, I would suggest, God wants that deer to live."" 
McFadden says: ""But according to gun owners, what you've just described would ban most guns used by hunters today."" 
Bloomberg: ""If that's what they're using, for God sakes, why aren't they using dynamite? Just make it easier. I mean, what's the sport?"" 
Did that interview constitute a proposal to ban more than three bullets? 
Not according to Bloomberg’s spokesman, John McCarthy, who shared the Bloomberg speech and letter supporting legislation to ban magazines that hold more than 10 rounds. 
""Everything we have proposed has been very public. We have never proposed that,"" McCarthy said.  ""We have been very clear about what we have wanted and have seven years' worth of public advocacy, reports, press releases and more. We have never called for that, nor did he in that interview."" 
‘Firearms with nukes’ 
Did Bloomberg say ""the NRA wants firearms with nukes on them""? 
Almost. 
He said the group would support the right to own them. 
Here’s what he told MSNBC anchor Mika Brzezinski on Dec. 18, 2012’s Morning Joe: 
""The U.S. Army has a rifle — they call it a rifle. I would call it a cannon. It’s attached to the front of a tank or a moving vehicle,"" Bloomberg said. ""It shoots a nuclear warhead. The NRA would say, ‘Oh, that’s a gun. And people have a right to have that.’ "" 
(We searched for a sign the NRA would indeed say such a thing. At the moment, the group pokes fun at the idea. Meanwhile, it once blessed a ban on fully automatic machine guns, much less ones with nuclear warheads. Still, soon afterward it said it supported ""the right of law-abiding individuals to choose to own any firearm, including automatic firearms."") 
Why did Bloomberg think the NRA would support a nuclear-armed populace? 
""The NRA used to support background checks, and now they don't,"" McCarthy said. ""The mayor was using a rhetorical device to point out that if you oppose every regulation, you will allow anything."" 
Our ruling 
LaPierre claimed that Bloomberg has said ""we can only have three bullets"" and ""the NRA wants firearms with nukes on them."" He’s partially right. 
Bloomberg suggested on MSNBC that the NRA would support the right to carry a cannon firing nuclear warheads — but his point was that the organization always supports gun rights, not that it was actively promoting nuclear weapons. And while he hasn’t formally proposed a three-bullet maximum, he does support banning magazines that hold more than 10 rounds and has said anyone who needs more than three is ""a pretty lousy shot.""

"""If you go back to 1999, Wayne LaPierre testified on behalf of the NRA that background checks were appropriate and should be done.""","In back-to-back appearances on Meet the Press, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and the NRA’s Wayne LaPierre went another round in their duel over proposed gun legislation.   Bloomberg is pushing for universal background checks on all firearm purchases. LaPierre opposes expanded background checks. Both are working hard to discredit the other.     During Bloomberg’s segment, he told host David Gregory that once upon a time, LaPierre was in favor of the background checks he’s now fighting.     ""In fact, if you go back to 1999, Wayne LaPierre testified on behalf of the NRA that background checks were appropriate and should be done,"" Bloomberg said.     We’re fact-checking statements by both Bloomberg and LaPierre from Meet the Press. Here, we’ll examine the New York mayor’s characterization of what LaPierre said back in 1999.     ‘We think it’s reasonable’     On May 27, 1999, LaPierre testified before the House Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Crime. The Columbine High School shooting, in which 12 high school students and one teacher were murdered, had happened a month earlier.     To rebut what he saw as a demonization of the NRA and its members, LaPierre listed a number of actions and laws he said were good policy.     First on that list:     ""We think it's reasonable to provide mandatory instant criminal background checks for every sale at every gun show. No loopholes anywhere for anyone,"" he said. ""That means closing the Hinckley loophole so the records of those adjudicated mentally ill are in the system. This isn't new, or a change of position, or a concession. I've been on record on this point consistently, from our national meeting in Denver, to paid national ads and position papers, to news interviews and press appearances.""     He also spoke in favor of preventing juvenile felons from ever owning guns, setting up instant background checks at gun shows and keeping schools gun-free.     Other evidence     New York magazine, in a January 2013 story, dug up the advertising campaign LaPierre mentioned in his testimony. Titled ""Be reasonable,"" the NRA ads that ran in national newspapers said, ""We think it's reasonable to provide for instant checks at gun shows just like at gun stores and pawn shops. But what's unreasonable is how the proposed Lautenberg legislation ignores the 250,000 prohibited people, like felons, who've walked away from gun stores — instead of being prosecuted for a federal felony for trying to buy a gun.""     We contacted the NRA for this story but did not receive a response about Bloomberg’s claim.   In January, NRA board member Sandy Froman told CNN, ""The NRA has changed its position, and the reason it's changed its position is because the system doesn't work.""   LaPierre himself acknowledged this change in a January 2013 Senate hearing in the wake of the Newtown, Conn., elementary school shooting.     ""I do not believe the way the law is working now, unfortunately, that it does any good to extend the law to private sales between hobbyists and collectors. … The fact is, the law right now is a failure the way it's working,"" he said.     Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., then said, ""I understand, back in 1999, you said no loopholes anywhere for anyone. But now you do not support background checks for all buyers of firearms?""     LaPierre responded: ""I think the National Instant Check System, the way it's working now, is a failure. Because this administration is not prosecuting the people that they catch. Twenty-three states are not even putting the mental records of those adjudicated mentally incompetent into the system. Now, assume that if you don't prosecute, and they try to buy a gun, even if you catch them, and you let them walk away, to assume they're not going to get a gun -- they're criminals, they're homicidal maniacs, and they're mentally ill. I mean, we all know that homicidal maniacs, criminals and the insane ... don't abide by the law.""     The NRA’s website on March 12, 2013, posted its firm stance against expanding background checks:     ""The NRA opposes criminalizing private firearms transfers between law-abiding individuals, and therefore opposes an expansion of the background check system.""     Our ruling     Bloomberg said that in 1999, ""Wayne LaPierre testified on behalf of the NRA that background checks were appropriate and should be done.""     In congressional testimony following the Columbine High School shooting, LaPierre called it ""reasonable"" to conduct a background check ""for every sale at every gun show. No loopholes anywhere for anyone."" Subsequent statements by NRA officials acknowledge that the group’s position has since changed to opposition to more background checks",True,"March 26, 2013"
"Says of 80,000 people who were denied a firearm in 2012 due to a failed background check, only 44 were prosecuted.","
Before Congress enacts any new gun control laws, the nation’s law enforcement officers and courts should better enforce the regulations they have on the books now, according to U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte. 
In a meeting with the Telegraph editorial board, New Hampshire’s junior senator took aim last month at the national background check system, which does not go far enough prosecuting those who illegally try to obtain weapons, she said. 
""Of approximately 80,000 in 2012 that were denied (a gun) because of a background check … only 44 people were prosecuted for that,"" Ayotte said during the February 19 meeting. 
""That surprised me,"" she said. ""I want to look further at what we’re doing in terms of enforcement."" 
If Ayotte’s numbers are right, the nation’s .055 prosecution rate doesn’t make for a very good shooting percentage. So, we decided to run the numbers ourselves. 
But first, some background. 
According to federal figures, most applicants who are denied a firearm through the FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System are rejected because of a prior criminal conviction, restraining order or another past issue. 
In almost every case, these people can be prosecuted. Here’s why: 
Firearms dealers, who provide the federal application form, are instructed to immediately turn away applicants if they acknowledge a past conviction or other prior issue, even before they conduct the FBI check. 
Applications that are submitted to the FBI and later rejected are typically denied because the applicant failed to acknowledge their record on the initial form, which can qualify as a federal crime for providing false information. 
In rare cases, an applicant might initially succeed in obtaining a firearm, despite a criminal record. But once the background check returns showing their past convictions, they could face charges of being a felon in possession of a firearm. 
Now, on to the numbers. 
Reached for comment, Ayotte’s staff pointed us in the direction of  U.S. Attorney Timothy Heaphy. 
Earlier this winter, Heaphy, who represents the western district of Virginia, presented those numbers to members of the Senate judiciary committee during a Feb. 12 hearing on gun violence. 
In his testimony, Heaphy cited research published recently by the U.S. Department of Justice, in conjunction with the Regional Justice Information Service, a Missouri-based group that provides research for the justice department, among other public safety and governmental agencies. 
The information service’s research supports Ayotte, and Heaphy’s numbers, showing 80,191 applications denied, along with 44 active prosecutions. 
But, these numbers are based on 2010 data, not 2012, as Ayotte and Heaphy claimed, and reflect only a portion of the total national figures, according to Ronald Frandsen, grants administrator for the information service.
.
The 80,191 figure, reported in a February study titled ""Background Checks for Firearm Transfers, 2010,"" includes only those applications denied by state and local permitting agencies, Frandsen said. 
Under the federal Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993, gun shop owners and other licensed authorities in many states -- 21 to be exact, including New Hampshire -- conduct at least a portion of the background checks themselves through the FBI’s background check system. 
Agencies in these states conducted about 4.37 million checks in 2010, leading to the 80,191 denials, according to Frandsen’s report. 
But, those 29 states that do not conduct the checks themselves defer instead to the FBI to do so. In 2010, the FBI conducted about 6.04 million checks, 72,659 of which were denied, Frandsen noted in the study. 
That places the total number of denied checks conducted in 2010 at 152,850 -- about 1.5 percent of the checks conducted. 
Now on to the prosecutions count. 
A separate report, ""Enforcement of the Brady Act, 2010,""  published by Frandsen in August, counts 62 charges filed across the country by U.S. Attorneys in 2010, most for falsifying when buying firearms (22) and possession of firearms by a convicted felon (11). Of those 62 charges, 18 were dropped that year, leaving 44 cases intact, according to Frandsen’s report. 
That number equals Ayotte’s claim. But, once again, it tells only part of the story. 
The 44 charges, 13 of which were still pending at the end of 2011, reflect only those cases brought by federal prosecutors and does not consider charges filed by state or local police agencies, Frandsen noted. 
In his research, Frandsen tracks those local cases reported voluntarily by states. In 2010, four states -- Colorado, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Virginia -- reported 1,520 arrests. That count does not include any arrests made that year in the remaining 17 states that conduct at least some background checks themselves. 
""You’d have to say (the total number of arrests) would be higher,"" Frandsen said. ""There’s no question."" 
Our ruling: 
On the numbers, Ayotte is on track. In one year, more than 80,000 background checks were denied at the state and local level and federal authorities pursued 44 charges in court, as the senator claimed. However, the report she cited is based on 2010 numbers, not 2012, but that’s small potatoes. 
More to the point, Ayotte confuses state and federal numbers in her statement, using state rejections (80,000) and federal prosecutions (44). Looking at state enforcement alone, just four states had more than 1,500 arrests. While those are arrests, not prosecutions, it stands to reason the number of state prosecutions is vastly higher than the figure Ayotte cited. 
That ratio is not nearly as dramatic as Ayotte suggested, but her larger point remains valid: the majority of failed background checks do not lead to criminal charges or prosecutions",Mostly True,"March 22, 2013"
"Says Virginia, Florida and Georgia are the three states that are the principal source for gun trafficking.","
The gun-debate rhetoric has been constant in the months since the Newtown shooting in Connecticut in December. 
Elected officials at every level have pitched gun control proposals, including President Barack Obama, whose $500 million package of gun legislation includes an assault weapons ban and universal background checks for gun buyers. 
Last month, U.S. Rep. Jim Moran talked about Newtown and gun proposals during floor debate about gun violence. In discussing background checks and gun trafficking, Moran urged his fellow lawmakers to ""act responsibly"" and approve some of the gun control measures. 
""In Virginia, we are one of the three states that are the principal source for trafficking of guns. Florida and Georgia are the other two,"" Moran said during a floor discussion of the issues. 
PolitiFact Georgia wondered if the Peach State, and the other two states, actually held this unfortunate distinction. And what about Texas? With its close proximity to Mexico and that country’s history of illegal gun activity, surely the Lone Star State was high on the gun trafficking list. 
Moran made his comments alongside fellow Rep. Jackie Speier, D-Calif. Speier was shot five times in 1978, while serving as a staff member to then-U.S. Rep. Leo Ryan. The two officials were part of a rescue attempt of constituents from the People’s Temple compound in Jonestown, Guyana. Ryan was killed by gunfire on the mission. 
Moran’s office pointed us to a September 2010 ""Trace the Guns"" report by Mayors Against Illegal Guns, a self-described coalition of more than 900 U.S. mayors that works to help law enforcement target illegal guns. The study is based on ""crime gun trace data"" from the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. 
According to the report, for the years 2007 through 2009, the states of Florida and Virginia  ranked second or third among all states as the source for recovered firearms used in crimes in other states. Georgia ranked first each of those years, as well as in 2006, when Texas held the third position, beating out Florida. During those four years, nine of the top 10 source states for the trafficked guns -- Georgia, Florida, Virginia, Texas, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and California -- remained the same. In 2009, the top 10 states supplied 49 percent of the crime guns that crossed state lines. 
The study authors note that states with larger populations, like those in the top 10, can be expected to be a source of more crime guns. Controlling for population produces a crime gun ""export rate,"" the number of recovered crime guns purchased in states other than the purchase state, per 100,000 people. 
Using the export rate calculations, state rankings on the trafficking list change. Virginia and Georgia dropped to Nos. 7 and 10, respectively, in 2009, the data year included in the report. Florida ranked 29th, just above the national average. Topping the per capita list were Mississippi, West Virginia and Kentucky, which occupied the top three positions. 
The three states of Virginia, Florida and Georgia, mentioned by Moran, have similarities that influence their gun trafficking rankings, said Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research. 
""Not all gun sales in these states are regulated, the states don’t tend to have any type of regulatory oversight of gun dealers and they are all along the I-95 corridor,"" he said. That interstate corridor, running along the eastern seaboard from Maine to Florida, is seen as a pipeline for illegal goods. 
Webster’s center recently completed a book, ""Reducing Gun Violence in America,"" examining the relationship of gun sales regulations and the rate at which guns cross borders into the hands of criminals. 
""There is a lot of profit to be made in the far Northeastern states where the laws are much stricter,"" Webster said. ""A gun that can be bought in these three states at a retail price of $100 can be sold for $400 in New York City,"" he said. 
PolitiFact Georgia also found a 2011 study conducted by Brown University economist Brian Knight that explored the state-to-state flow of illegal firearms in the country and examined the role of state gun regulations. That study, also based on ATF crime gun data, found that guns flow from states with less restrictive gun laws into states with restrictive laws. For example, the report found that the largest firearm suppliers to New York are Florida, Georgia and Virginia. 
Gun control organizations have given the three states that Moran mentions low ratings for their gun laws. On the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence’s 2011 scorecard, Virginia received a 12; Georgia received an 8; Florida got a 3 on a scale to 100 on the strength of the states’ gun laws. Similarly, the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence gave all three states D’s in its 2012 ""Gun Laws Matter"" report grading state gun laws. 
Earlier this month, a U.S. Senate committee passed a bill that makes gun trafficking a federal crime with up to 25 years in prison for people who legally buy guns but give them to others who use them in crimes. And last month, members of both parties in the U.S. House introduced a gun proposal that would increase penalties on the illegal purchase and transportation of guns. 
So what’s the draw? 
U.S. Rep. Jim Moran said that the states of Virginia, Florida and Georgia are the principal source for gun trafficking, and urged his congressional colleagues to pass some of the proposed gun control measures. 
Based on crime gun data recorded by the ATF and cited in several studies and publications, those three states hold the top three spots from 2007 to 2009 for crime guns that are trafficked to other states. In 2006, Texas overtook Florida for the third spot, but Georgia held the top position throughout the four-year period. 
Adjusting for population, Virginia and Georgia still rank in the top 10 gun-exporting states, but Florida drops to No. 29. 
Moran’s statement is accurate but lacks that important detail. Ultimately, the data and experts tie the gun trafficking to states’ gun laws, and these three states have laws that are less restrictive than others surrounding them",Mostly True,"March 20, 2013"
"U.S. Rep. Scott Rigell ""wants gun owners in a federal registration system.""","
U.S. Rep. Scott Rigell, R-2nd, is being targeted by a pro-gun group for supporting for ""Obama’s gun control.""

The National Association for Gun Rights aired an ad in Hampton Roads earlier this month criticizing Rigell for co-sponsoring legislation that would increase penalties for people who illegally purchase firearms or transport them across state lines.

""Rigell also wants gun owners in a federal registration system,"" the ad said.

We wondered whether Rigell, who boasts a pro-gun background, really has endorsed a federal gun registry. The congressman, in a news release, dismissed the charge as ""laughable.""

The group is headquartered in Fredericksburg and bills itself as the ""fastest growing guns right group in America."" We made three requests to the association for information that would back up its claim about Rigell. No one got back to us. So we poked around on our own.

Let’s start with a little background. The federal government since 1986 has been explicitly forbidden from keeping a registration system connecting most firearms to their owners. Even when Congress passed legislation in 1993 that instituted the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, it did not allow the government to keep information about firearm purchasers in order to build a data base.

In the wake of shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut last December that left 20 children and six teachers dead, President Barack Obama made a series of proposals to strengthen gun laws. One of them calls for expanding background checks, which now apply to people who buy guns from licensed dealers. Obama says people who buy arms from private individuals should also be checked out.

Rigell has said in at least two interviews that he would be willing to consider proposals for expanded or universal background checks.

The National Rifle Association, the most influential of guns rights organizations, claims the president’s support of universal background checks is tantamount to creating a federal registry. The NRA argues that expanding the checks will create a slippery slope that will lead to the registry.

FactCheck.org said in January that ""it’s simply not accurate to suggest that Obama’s plan for universal background checks would result in a massive federal registry."" They pointed out that Congress, since 2004, has inserted language in annual spending bills requiring the FBI to destroy firearm transfer records within 24 hours of approval of the sales.

Obama’s gun control agenda also includes a limit on the number of bullets a magazine can hold, an assault weapons ban and more support for mental health care. But none of the 23 proposals calls for a federal registry.

Some Democratic members of Congress, including Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California and Rep. Bobby Rush of Illinois, have introduced bills that would create gun registries. Rigell has vowed to oppose the measures. ""As a gun owner, hunter and lifetime member of the NRA, I have not and will not support legislation which establishes in any form a national registry of guns or gun owners,"" he said on Feb. 28.

That’s consistent with a statement Rigell posted on his campaign website in 2010, when he was first elected to Congress. ""Federal licensing of law-abiding gun owners and national gun registration would violate our Second Amendment rights,"" he wrote.

Rigell, as we’ve noted, did co-sponsor a gun bill earlier this year that would increase the federal penalties for straw purchasers -- people who buy weapons for those who cannot pass background checks -- and for runners who transport guns across state lines.

But the bill makes no mention of a federal registry.

Our ruling

The National Association for Gun Rights claims that Rigell wants a national gun registration system. The record shows he has consistently opposed that idea.

The association offers no proof for its claim, which is wrong and inflammatory",False Pants on Fire,"March 18, 2013"
Georgia has the most lax gun laws in the nation.,"
PolitiFact Georgia is usually interested when an elected official claims the Peach State is first or worst in a particular category.

State Sen. Donzella James, a Democrat who represents portions of Douglas and Fulton counties, had us listening closely when she made a specific statement about guns and Georgia.

The lawmakers were discussing Senate Bill 101, which would allow Georgians as young as 18 to be granted a gun license if they’ve completed basic military training, as long as the person has not been dishonorably discharged. The bill also would eliminate a ban on guns in public housing, unless required by federal law or regulation. 

Senate Bill 101 passed by a 41-10 margin and is now in the hands of the House of Representatives. 

James had serious concerns about the bill and went into the well to speak in front of her colleagues.

""We know that Georgia has the most lax laws (for) carrying guns,"" said James, a self-described gun owner, who prefaced her remarks by saying she hadn’t planned to speak.

James was referring to Georgia’s gun laws in general, not just permits to carry firearms.

We wondered: Does Georgia have the most lax gun laws in America?

Some gun control organizations regularly rank each state based on its gun laws. The most prominent group, the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, gave Georgia an 8 on a scale of 100 in terms of the toughness of its gun laws in 2011. Liz Flowers, a spokeswoman for the Georgia Senate Democrats, sent us a link to that report. 

To clarify, 8 is not considered a good score as far as gun control advocates are concerned. Georgia received points for not allowing guns on college campuses, requiring a license, record-keeping and retention and police inspections. 

For those who are distressed by Georgia’s score, take comfort. Twenty-seven states received lower scores than Georgia that year. Alaska, Arizona and Utah received not one point. In 2009, the Brady Campaign also gave Georgia a score of 8. There were nearly 20 states that received a lower score.

The National Rifle Association’s Institute for Legislative Action has been unimpressed with the Brady rankings. It notes only a handful of states receive passing marks from Brady and say states that score high have higher crime rates. The NRA complains the Brady Campaign gives points to states with gun laws that supplement federal gun laws.

Another group, the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, gave Georgia a D for the toughness of its gun control laws. Again, many states did far worse. Twenty states received a grade of F from the group. The center gives best practices for policies such as laws prohibiting gun dealers from residential areas, laws requiring a license to purchase ammunition and those that require gun safety training.

UCLA Law School professor Eugene Volokh, who has been writing and teaching about U.S. gun laws for several years, says it is difficult to completely determine which states have the most lax gun laws because there are so many ways to examine the claim. For example, he said, it can be examined by the types of weapons permitted in each state. Some criteria he prefers are examining how easy it is to carry a concealed gun or at what age you can get a permit.

Four states -- Alaska, Arizona, Vermont and Wyoming -- allow law-abiding adults to carry a concealed firearm without a permit, The Washington Post noted. The Post also reported that Vermont allows people as young as 16 to buy a handgun. Georgia laws are not as permissive, Volokh observed.

""Georgia is not the most gun-friendly state in the nation, but probably not the most hostile, either,"" Volokh said. 

So where does this all leave us? The senator said, ""We know that Georgia has the most lax laws (for) carrying guns."" 

From our review, Georgia is considered to have some lax gun laws. It’s possible from some of the changes proposed, Georgia could score lower in the future. But, for now, there are other states that are far more permissive",False,"March 13, 2013"
"""More than 80 percent of Americans believe we need to have universal background checks.""","
Some gun-control advocates use as part of their arsenal in the national debate on this issue that most Americans support their effort, including background checks.

Georgia state Sen. Nan Orrock, an Atlanta Democrat, made a specific claim about public support for such checks during a floor debate about Senate Bill 101, which she feared would expand access to guns.

""More than 80 percent of Americans believe we need to have universal background checks,"" Orrock said.

SB 101 would allow Georgians as young as 18 to be granted a gun license if they’ve completed basic military training, as long as they were not dishonorably discharged. The bill also would eliminate a ban on guns in public housing, unless a ban is required by federal law or regulation. It passed the Senate by a 41-10 vote and is being reviewed by the state House of Representatives.

PolitiFact Georgia decided to do some checking to see whether the senator is correct or is she exaggerating public support for such guidelines.

After the December shootings of 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., President Barack Obama put Vice President Joe Biden in charge of coming up with legislation to stem such violence. In January, Obama announced a series of proposals that includes background checks for all gun sales.

Federal law currently requires federally licensed gun dealers to conduct background checks before selling a firearm. There is no federal law that requires private gun dealers to do such background checks. A handful of states (Georgia is not one of them) require private dealers to conduct background checks. Gun control advocates want to require private dealers to conduct such a check, which is commonly known as a ""universal background check.""

Several Democrats, including Obama, have said about 40 percent of all guns are sold without a background check. PolitiFact has reviewed this claim several times and noted it’s based on a 1997 study, rating it Half True.

Liz Flowers, a spokeswoman for the state Senate Democrats, sent us several polls she says support Orrock’s point.

Here’s a look at some of the polls Flowers sent us and some we found: 

There was a margin of error of about 3 percentage points to 4 percentage points in each poll.

Our partners at PolitiFact in Washington recently fact-checked a claim by Obama that ""overwhelming majorities of Americans"" support gun legislation ""like background checks."" PolitiFact noted some of the same polls we reviewed. PolitiFact concluded more than 80 percent of Americans support universal background checks",Mostly True,"March 12, 2013"
"Research found that ""over the course of the existence of the Brady Bill ban, the use of assault weapons in crimes decreased by two thirds.""","
Coming off his emotional congressional testimony backing legislation to renew a ban on military-style assault weapons, Milwaukee Police Chief Ed Flynn appeared on MSNBC.

Asked about criticism alleging that the previous ban had almost no impact on the nation’s homicide rate, Flynn cited studies on the ban done for the U.S. Department of Justice.

Researchers, said Flynn, found that ""over the course of the existence of the Brady Bill ban, the use of assault weapons in crimes decreased by two-thirds. ""

He added: ""Now, they couldn’t prove causation. Police implemented and embraced a wide variety of strategies and tactics during those 10 years as well. But it’s foolish not to see that there was a correlation. And to demand perfect social science causation proof before we can say that something had an impact on a phenomenon is foolish, it’s rhetorical and it doesn’t relate to the reality of policing.""

As Congress debates tightening gun controls after the Newtown school massacre, we thought it was worth checking Flynn’s assertion about assault-weapon use during the ban that began in 1994 and expired in 2004.

Did a study show a two-thirds drop off in use of assault weapons in crimes?

The claim is in wide circulation, having found its way into talking points that U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-California) offers for the renewal of the assault weapons ban. The National Rifle Association, which is fighting the ban, disputes the number.

At issue is a 2004 study, sponsored by the National Institute of Justice, an arm of the U.S. Justice Department. Its author, Christopher S. Koper, also did the federally sponsored report for Congress on the short term (1994-1996) effect of the ban.

Koper is a veteran criminology researcher, formerly of the Police Executive Research Forum. At the time of the 2004 study he was a professor affiliated with the Jerry Lee Center of Criminology at the University of Pennsylvania. He is now at the Center for Evidence-Based Crime Policy at George Mason University.

The 1994 ban was aimed at semiautomatics, including rifles and pistols, with features ""that appear useful in military and criminal applications but unnecessary in shooting sports or self-defense (examples include flash hiders, folding rifle stocks, and threaded barrels for attaching silencers),"" the study said.

Flynn and Feinstein point to a conclusion in Koper’s 2004 report that found a big decline in the percentage of assault weapons among the guns seized by law enforcement and sent to federal officials for tracing.

That percentage dropped by 70 percent between 1992-’03 and 2001-’02. That is, the percentage went from 5.4 percent to 1.6 percent of guns seized, the study found. The percentages are low because the guns are rarely used in gun crimes.

That 70 percent drop is the main evidence for the ""two-thirds"" claim.

There’s another piece of data from Koper’s study that suggests such a major decline. It’s the experience in Boston pre-ban (1991 to 1993) and post-ban (2000 to 2002). There, police saw a 72 percent drop in assault weapons among all guns recovered by police.

Let’s take a closer look at both.

""The overriding point is that we found consistent evidence across multiple national and local data sources that the use of (assault weapons) declined substantially during the ban years,"" Koper said in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin. The apparent drop was mainly in assault pistols, not assault rifles.

In addition, Koper wrote, based on figures collected in six metro police department ""there were indications in the data that (assault weapons) were becoming increasingly rare over time.""

Koper, however, made clear that he did not try to come up with one definitive number that illustrated the decline in assault weapons seen in the data.

A reading of the study shows why. It cautions in great detail that data that shows a 70 percent decline nationally is not conclusive.

First, a large majority of guns recovered by police are not sent to federal authorities who trace the gun from its manufacture to sale. So those guns may not be representative of the types of firearms seized by police, the study noted.

In addition, the drop may be attributable ""in large part"" to changes in tracing practices, the study noted.

Still, Koper noted in the 2004 study that the dramatic decline started in the year of the ban.

Ultimately, he concluded that the trace data ""suggest"" an actual decline in use of assault weapons in crimes.

Koper told us the national tracing data ""may overstate the drop, but it's understandable that people cite that number since it's a national figure.""

He added: ""At any rate, there are lots of subtleties in this and no one right answer.""

The National Rifle Association critique of the Flynn-Feinstein claim is that ""traces are not synonymous with crimes.""

The study acknowledges that, but cites a variety of reasons why guns recovered by police should serve as a ""good approximation"" of the types of guns used in violent crime, even though many are not clearly linked to such crimes.

When we asked Flynn about this, Police Inspector WilliamJessupwrote back saying: ""While there are limitations with any type of data, Chief Flynn does consider the 70 percent drop in ATF traces on assault weapons to be a reasonable proxy for the level of crime involving assault weapons during that period.""

Local findings

Koper told us that people who refer to a ""two-thirds"" drop might also be referring to the study’s finding of a 72 percent reduction in assault weapon use in Boston based on police data about crime guns there.

Other metro areas in the study also saw a decline, but only Boston’s dropoff was in the two-thirds range.

Milwaukee County was in the study. Data collected here -- just on guns used in homicides -- showed a 17 percent drop from 1995 to 1998 compared to before the ban.

That was the smallest reduction among weapon trends studied in Baltimore, Boston, Miami-Dade, St. Louis, Milwaukee and Anchorage. The reductions generally were between 32 and 40 percent, the study said.

The Koper study concluded by finding ""mixed"" success at reducing criminal use of banned guns -- as well as ammunition feeding devices known as large capacity magazines.

The decline suggested by the national trace data and the experience in several cities ""was offset throughout at least the late 1990s by steady or rising use of other guns"" equipped with large capacity magazines, based on data studied in Baltimore, Milwaukee, Louisville, and Anchorage, the study found. There was an immense stock of exempted pre-ban magazines and it grew as more imports came in, it noted.

Bottom line, the study said, was that ""because the ban has not yet reduced the use of (large capacity magazines) in crime, we cannot clearly credit the ban with any of the nation’s recent drop in gun violence."" The ban’s exemption of millions of pre-ban weapons and magazines ensured gradual effects that ""are still unfolding and may not be fully felt for several years into the future,"" the study found.

Our rating

In a cable TV appearance, Flynn said researchers had found that ""over the course of the existence of the Brady Bill ban, the use of assault weapons in crimes decreased by two thirds.""

Flynn accurately quotes the 70 percent figure from an oft-cited study by a veteran researcher for the U.S. Department of Justice. The study makes no claim that the ban caused the apparent decline, but neither does Flynn.

Flynn’s claim suffers somewhat, though, from an excess of certainty. The study and its author offer numerous and serious cautions that make clear the 70 percent figure -- while suggestive of a major drop -- is not a definitive figure. And the study makes clear that not all weapons traced by authorities are, as Flynn’s statement implied, used ""in crimes.""

Those are important details that were missing",Half True,"March 11, 2013"
"A proposed ban on hollow-point bullets and bullets that expand upon impact ""essentially bans deer hunting.""","In the months following the Sandy Hook school massacre, Wisconsin Democrats moved to restrict access to firearms and ammunition.

Those efforts included the drafting of a bill in the state Assembly by Reps. Frederick Kessler, Evan Goyke and Mandela Barnes, all Milwaukee Democrats.

Among other things, the bill would restrict sales and possession of hollow-point bullets, a type of ammunition that expands on impact and creates even larger wounds. Authorities said Adam Lanza, the Sandy Hook killer, used bullets designed to inflict maximum damage by breaking up in a victim’s body. Kessler argued banning such bullets would give the victims of a mass shooting at least a chance of survival.

But that bill would have a far greater impact, said conservative talk show host Vicki McKenna on Feb. 18, 2013.

It would end deer hunting, a key part of the state’s culture, said McKenna, whose show is aired in Milwaukee, Madison and LaCrosse.

""Democrats in Wisconsin want to fight crime by banning deer hunting,"" McKenna said.

She explained that the bill ""proposed taking hollow-pointed ammunition off the shelves. Which essentially bans deer hunting because you can only use an expanding bullet to deer hunt.""

That caught our attention. After all, the state sold more than 614,000 licenses as of the start of the gun deer season in November 2012. That’s equivalent to a little more than 10 percent of the state’s population.

So is McKenna right? Would Kessler’s bill blow away the gun deer hunt? (We’ll avoid picking nits and assume the bow hunting season would remain.)

We turned to the experts to learn more about bullets and Bambi.

The proposed legislation

According to the Legislative Reference Bureau: ""This bill prohibits a person, with certain exceptions such as for law enforcement, from selling, transporting, manufacturing, or possessing any hollowpoint bullet, any bullet that expands or flattens easily in the human body, or any bullet with a hard envelope that does not entirely cover the core of the bullet.""

That bans a lot of bullets.

But what does this have to do with deer hunting?

We asked Tim Lawhern, the state Department of Natural Resource’s top official on such matters.

For years, state law required hunters of deer and others species to use hollow-point bullets, said Lawhern, administrator of the DNR’s enforcement and science division.

The law was modified a couple years ago because more and more hunters were hunting with a different sort of ammunition -- often made of solid copper --  that also changed shape on impact, but was not a hollow point.

State law now says it’s illegal to hunt deer with ""non-expanding bullets.""

Said Lawhern: ""It must be the expanding type of ammunition.""

The idea is that bullets that expand on impact do more damage, cause greater hemorrhaging, and the animal dies in a swifter, more humane manner, Lawhern explained.

So Kessler and company want to ban the very kind of bullets that hunters are required to use.

What ammo would that leave hunters with?

""Nothing,"" said Lawhern. ""Archery. You could use archery equipment.""

Banning hollow-point bullets ""would have a negative impact on deer hunting,"" said George Meyer, former DNR secretary and executive director of Wisconsin Wildlife Federation.

""If they don’t have any ammunition they could use, it certainly doesn’t sound good if you’re a hunter,"" Lawhern said.

Legions of hunters would have the same reaction about an expanding-bullet ban, he added.

""You’ll have the largest army in the world saying, ‘What, are you nuts?’""

A change in plans

Apparently they won’t have to worry.

Shortly after word got out -- including on McKenna’s show -- Kessler admitted he and the other lawmakers had shot themselves in the foot.

They’re rewriting the bill to ""remove any conflicts of law and provide exemptions that honor our state’s great sporting heritage,"" Kessler said in a Feb. 19, 2013, statement, a day after McKenna’s show on the subject.

The bill ""was never intended to conflict with current laws or codes related to Wisconsin’s rich hunting tradition and those who annually participate in it,"" Kessler said, adding that the draft bills ""contained unintended oversights.""

He added: ""We will be working with the Legislative Reference Bureau, Legislative Council and the Department of Natural Resources to ensure that any future bill drafts are consistent with current sporting and hunting regulations.""

Kessler said in an interview that he still wants to limit sales of hollow-point bullets, but with an exemption for hunters.

Such ammunition would be available ""only to people who have licenses to hunt, who are on their way to hunt and it’s hunting season, "" Kessler said.

So let’s bag this one.

McKenna said a proposal to restrict sale and possession of hollow-point and flattening or expanding bullets ""essentially bans deer hunting.""

McKenna’s right on an important front. Deer hunters are required to use bullets that expand on impact -- including hollow points. And Kessler wanted to ban those very bullets. So it would leave gun hunters without bullets.

But she’s wrong by suggesting that the Democrats were seeking to ban hunting.

Kessler admitted hunting never crossed his mind when the bill was drafted in an effort to protect mass shooting victims. The city slickers came up with a bill with a problem that stood out like a white tail between the cross hairs.

As it stood, the law would have banned the bullets. But it didn’t ban hunting",Mostly True,"March 10, 2013"
"""We have over 300,000,000 weapons, firearms in this country. That’s almost as big as the population.""","
As the gun violence debate rages on across the nation, a former New Jersey governor is offering a statistic about the prevalence of weapons in the United States.

""We have over 300,000,000 weapons, firearms in this country. That’s almost as big as the population,"" Florio said during an interview for Governors’ Perspective, an occasional segment for ""On the Record"" with Michael Aron on NJTV that aired Feb. 16. Former Gov. Christine Todd Whitman also participated in the interview.

Florio’s statistic seems pretty high – there are almost as many firearms as people in the United States?

He’s correct.

First, let’s review population totals.  As of Monday, the U.S. Census Bureau’s POPClock lists the nation’s population as 315,433,299.

Now let’s look into that guns figure.

Florio, a Democrat, told us he got the number from New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s Mayors Against Illegal Guns coalition.

""All of the gun control organizations use it,"" Florio said. ""No one has really refuted it.""

The coalition of more than 850 mayors from across the country works to prevent criminals from getting guns illegally while also supporting legal gun ownership, according to its website.

It’s worth noting that the National Rifle Association even cites the statistic, based on data from the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.

""The number of privately owned guns in the U.S. is at an all-time high, upwards of 300 million, and now rises by about 10 million per year,"" the NRA’s Institute for Legislative Action said in a firearms safety fact sheet released Jan. 17.

Donna Sellers, a spokeswoman for the ATF in Washington, said there is no national firearms registry, except for those firearms defined in the National Firearms Act, and instead pointed us to manufacturing and import/export reports maintained on the ATF website.

""We would have no way of knowing how many firearms there are,"" Sellers said.

Florio also is correct that other gun-control organizations cite the 300 million figure.

The Brady Campaign to End Gun Violence directed us to a September 2010 Gun Control Facts report that looks at population, gun manufacturing in the United States, ownership, crimes and more.

""As of 2009, the United States has a population of 307 million people. Based on production data from firearm manufacturers, there are roughly 300 million firearms owned by civilians in the United States as of 2010,"" the report by James D. Agresti and Reid K. Smith stated.

""There’s no perfect estimate of firearms in the U.S. because creating a national registry of firearms is prohibited by federal law,"" Alex Katz, a spokesman for Mayors Against Illegal Guns, said in an e-mail. ""But academics and interest groups across the political spectrum broadly agree on the 300 million figure.""

A November 2012 report titled ""Gun Control Legislation"" from the Congressional Research Service also supports that number.

As of 2009, the report states, ""the estimated total number of firearms available to civilians in the United States had increased to approximately 310 million: 114 million handguns, 110 million rifles, and 86 million shotguns.""

Our ruling

Florio said during a recent television interview, ""We have over 300,000,000 weapons, firearms in this country. That’s almost as big as the population.""

Data from a variety of sources including the Congressional Research Service, NRA and others confirm the 300 million figure. While population and firearms figures have fluctuated over the years, Florio’s point is clear: there’s nearly one gun for every person in the United States",True,"March 7, 2013"
"""Rhode Island could tell you who has a camper, but we couldn't figure out who has a gun.""","
Amid the vociferous national gun debate prompted by the Newtown, Conn., elementary school massacre, advocates for tightening gun laws often argue that authorities need to keep better track of weapons and their owners.

People must register cars and other vehicles, so they should also be required to register firearms, they assert.

In Rhode Island, state Rep. Linda Finn, D-Middletown, has submitted a bill that would do just that.

Finn’s bill, H-5573, would require Rhode Island residents to register their guns with local officials and pay a $100 fee per weapon. Failure to do so could result in up to three years in prison and up to a $3,000 fine.

Finn says her objective is to give local law enforcement basic information about who owns guns in the communities.

""Wouldn’t it be safer for them to know if they’re being called to a home that has a gun in it, or if they’re pulling over a person who has a gun?"" she said in a Feb. 26 news release.

She added: ""Rhode Island could tell you who has a camper, but we couldn't figure out who has a gun.""

Finn’s proposal drew hundreds of gun owners to the Rhode Island State House who argued that the bill violates the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and is a knee-jerk reaction that would not solve anything.

When we asked Finn about her comparison of campers and guns, she said she was referring to what local authorities can quickly ascertain as they respond to an incident.

If a camper such as a trailer or RV were involved in a crime, she said, authorities could quickly determine its owner and other information about it, but could not do the same for a gun because Rhode Island does not allow a central registry of private firearms.

We looked at her statement in two parts.

First, we confirmed with the state Division of Motor Vehicles that it requires registration of who owns campers used on roadways and keeps such a registry with information that can be accessed by the police.

Next, we examined Rhode Island’s gun laws. Statutes 11-47-35 and 11-47-35.2  say that anyone purchasing a handgun or rifle from a dealer must fill out an application, which is sent to the local police chief or state police for review. If there are no objections, the purchaser gets the gun after a seven-day waiting period.

The same statutes require the authorities to destroy the copies of the applications they received after they are reviewed.

And Statute 11-47-41 specifically forbids any ""government agency of the state"" or its ""political subdivisions"" to keep any list of privately owned guns or gun owners.

Rhode Island does, however, have a record of people who receive a permit to carry a pistol or revolver, both concealed and not concealed. A person must apply to the either the state Department of Attorney General or to a local police department, which decide whether to grant such a permit.

The Department of Attorney General has a database of permits to carry a pistol or revolver, which must be renewed every four years.

As of Dec. 31, 2012, the attorney general’s office had on record 3,403 active permits to carry a pistol or revolver, concealed and not concealed, that its office has issued over the years.

The attorney general’s office does not share its database with the police or other authorities because that is prohibited by law, according to Amy Kempe, spokeswoman for Attorney General Peter F. Kilmartin. Rather, the office simply confirms a permit holder’s information to a law enforcement agency if requested during an individual stop or arrest. The attorney general’s office also does not have information on permits to carry issued by local police departments.

Another provision of Rhode Island law -- 11-47-40 -- says all federally licensed gun dealers/sellers must keep a register of sales: dates, purchasers and type of firearm. But gun sellers are not government departments or agencies.

Our ruling

State Rep. Linda Finn, D-Middletown, said, ""Rhode Island could tell you who has a camper, but we couldn't figure out who has a gun.""

Finn is right in that there is no central registry accessible to authorities for all guns or gun owners in Rhode Island.

However, there is a subset of thousands of people who have permits to carry weapons that is maintained by the Department of Attorney General or by local police. It’s far from a complete list of every gun or gun owner and the police can access it only on a case-by- case basis",Mostly True,"March 7, 2013"
"""You can't bring an iPad or a piece of paper and a pencil in the (Wisconsin Assembly) gallery to take notes of what's going on,"" but ""you can bring a gun up there.""","Wisconsin Assembly Minority Leader Peter Barca was railing against Assembly Republicans during an interview on Feb. 19, 2013.

""Step by step by step, they're dismantling people's involvement in their democracy. And I think it's wrong,"" the Kenosha Democrat told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel editorial board.

Then Barca made a startling claim about rules in the Assembly gallery, where the general public can watch the Assembly in action.

""You can't bring an iPad or a piece of paper and a pencil in the gallery to take notes of what's going on. That's outrageous,"" he charged. ""But, yet you can bring a gun up there. It doesn't even equate. You can exercise your Second Amendment rights, but not your First Amendment rights.""

So, citizens who want to observe their elected representatives at the state Capitol can bring a firearm into the Assembly gallery -- but not an iPad or a pencil and paper?

Was Barca going ballistic?

Let's lock and load the Truth-O-Meter.

New rules

In January 2013, about a month before Barca made his claim, he and GOP Assembly Speaker Robin Vos announced they had agreed on new operating procedures for the Legislature's lower chamber.

Most any bipartisan agreement would be news, given that Republicans control the Assembly and Senate and hold the governor’s office.

In an effort to avoid all-night sessions, the two Assembly leaders said they would meet before each Assembly session to set time limits on debate for each bill. And they'd use a time clock for each speech.

But separate from the bipartisan deal, the Republican majority in the Assembly adopted stricter rules on members of the public in the Assembly's overhead viewing galleries. No recording devices, signs or hats would be allowed, the Journal Sentinel reported.

And remaining in place from the 2011-2012 legislative session was a provision allowing people with a valid permit to carry concealed weapons in the Assembly gallery.

(The Senate, by the way, prohibits guns -- as well as laptops, still photography and video or audio recordings -- in its gallery.)

The Assembly’s new prohibitions on recording devices were decried by Bill Lueders, president of the Wisconsin Freedom of Information Council, a nonprofit group dedicated to open government. He noted in an opinion article that the Open Meetings Law passed by the Legislature in 1977 directs all state and local governmental bodies in Wisconsin to ""make a reasonable effort to accommodate any person desiring to record, film or photograph the meeting,"" so long as this does not cause disruption.

How common are these various restrictions in public galleries in legislative chambers?

Angela Andrews of the National Conference of State Legislatures told us she was not aware of any state legislative body that prohibits pencils and paper, and not aware of any that prohibits audio and video recording devices. Fewer than 10 state capitol buildings allow guns, she said.

Barca’s claim

So, it’s clear Barca is correct in saying guns are allowed in the audience gallery of the Assembly; no change has been made since that rule took effect in the previous legislative session.

But what about the other two parts of his claim?

Check two portions of the Legislative Reference Bureau’s summary of Assembly Resolution 4, the new rules adopted by the GOP majority in January 2013:

""No individual may do any of the following in the visitor galleries: lean over or put any object over the balcony; use a laptop or other computer device; stand except for prayer or pledge of allegiance or as otherwise permitted by the presiding officer; use recording devices of any kind; use cell phones or pagers ….""

The laptop or computer device part pretty clearly prohibits the iPad, Apple’s mobile computing device, in the Assembly gallery.

""No individual in the visitor galleries may use any audio or video device to record, photograph, film, videotape, or in any way depict the proceedings on or about the Assembly floor.""

That’s an explicit ban on devices, but there’s no reference to jotting notes.

Barca spokeswoman Melanie Conklin told us that Barca’s key point in making his claim was that ""there is a lengthy list of items and behaviors – many of them not remotely disruptive – that are banned in the gallery or were discussed in meetings and in the floor speeches as being disruptive, while a visitor can bring a weapon into the gallery with no repercussions.""

Kit Beyer, spokeswoman for GOP speaker Vos, told us of the new rules: ""Nowhere does it say that an observer in the gallery cannot have a piece of paper or a pencil.""

Aiming for clarity on the pencil and paper question, we checked with experts.

Madison attorney Christa Westerberg, vice president of the Wisconsin Freedom of Information Council, said it’s not clear that the new rules would prohibit a pencil and paper in the gallery for taking notes.

Chris Ahmuty, the non-lawyer executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Wisconsin, said he has concerns about the new gallery rules but doesn’t think they prohibit a pencil and paper.

But Madison media lawyer Robert Dreps had a different take. He said it’s possible to construe a pencil as a recording device.

More importantly, nobody but the Assembly can say what its rules actually mean.

""Because it’s a legislative rule, it means, ultimately, what the Legislature says it means,"" Dreps said.

"""There’s more murders with hammers last year than...shotguns and pistols and AK-47s.""","
(Update: Those pesky, yet observant, PolitiFact Georgia readers. Several took note of our recent fact-check of state Sen. Bill Jackson. We looked at this precise statement: ""More murders were committed last year with hammers than with shotguns, rifles or AK-47s."" That statement, which appeared in news stories,  is accurate, according to FBI homicide statistics. Trouble is there is a video of Jackson’s statement. And in that video he uses the word ""pistols"" instead of ""rifles."" That changes the entire thrust of his statement. We called the reporter who wrote the initial news story. He checked his notes and agrees he got the quote wrong. Our readers were correct. And we dedicate the following revised fact-check to their keen observation skills.)


Some gun control critics are using a similar talking point in the national debate over this issue.

""There’s more with hammers than with shotguns and pistols and AK-47s,"" said state Sen. Bill Jackson, a Republican from Appling.

PolitiFact Georgia wondered if Jackson’s remarks were accurate, or was he attempting to make a political point with a bogus claim?

We quickly discovered our partners at other PolitiFact operations have examined similar claims before. Here’s what they found:

In January, some Facebook posts began to circulate that were critical of the White House’s proposal to restrict the availability of some weapons.

""Facts gun-control advocates don’t want you to know. According to the FBI, in 2011, 1,694 were murdered with knives, 726 with hands or feet, 496 with clubs or hammers, 323 with rifles of any type. But Obama wants to ban semi-automatic rifles?"" it read.

The FBI figures also showed that 356 people were killed with shotguns.

PolitiFact reviewed 2011 FBI data on the types of weapons used to commit murders. The numbers posted on Facebook nearly matched the FBI data. The Facebook post of how many people were killed with hands or feet was two below the FBI total of 728.

A few weeks later, our partners at PolitiFact Texas examined a similar claim from that state’s attorney general, Greg Abbott.

""FBI: More people killed with hammers & clubs each year than rifles,"" Abbott said in a Twitter post.

He supplied a link to a Jan. 3, 2013, Fox News commentary piece that originated on the conservative website Breitbart.com and referred to FBI murder statistics from 2005 through 2011.

PolitiFact Texas noted Abbott used selective data to base his claim. That said, PolitiFact Texas noted, it is correct that FBI data indicates that in 2011, more people were killed with ""clubs and hammers"" than with any type of rifle. They rated his claim True.

At first hearing, Jackson’s claim sounds similar. But when you note that he includes pistols, or handguns, in his comparison,  the similarities begin to fade.

Here are the 2011 FBI totals (the most recent year available) for the types of weapons used in homicides: 
Handguns:        6,220 
Rifles:            323 
Shotguns:        356 
Blunt Objects:        496 

As you can see, there’s a big difference between the handgun total and the rifles total and the total for shotguns. Webster's defines a pistol as a handgun. U.S. Rep",False Pants on Fire,"February 21, 2013"
"Says after Hurricane Sandy, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg ""refused to allow the National Guard into the city to restore civil order because Guardsmen carry guns!""","
Buy more guns, says Wayne LaPierre of the National Rifle Association, or you’ll be thrust into the ""hellish world"" of south Brooklyn after Hurricane Sandy.

LaPierre, in an appeal to gun owners published Feb. 13, 2013, by conservative news site Daily Caller, wrote that ""looters ran wild."" And, he added, the mayor didn’t help:

 ""Anti-gun New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg had already done everything he could to prevent law-abiding New Yorkers from owning guns, and he has made sure that no ordinary citizen will ever be allowed to carry a gun. He even refused to allow the National Guard into the city to restore civil order because Guardsmen carry guns!""

Did Bloomberg, co-chair of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, refuse ""to allow the National Guard into the city to restore civil order because Guardsmen carry guns""?

We dug into the facts and found that, while Bloomberg did mention guns when he said there wasn’t need for additional help from the National Guard, his main reason was that the New York Police Department was doing fine at keeping the peace.

 What Bloomberg refused

The NRA’s director of public affairs, Andrew Arulanandam, pointed us to the mayor’s Oct. 31, 2012, news conference, two days after Sandy’s storm surge devastated parts of New York City.

When Bloomberg opened up the floor to questions, a reporter jumped in: ""Mr. Mayor, Brooklyn borough president Marty Markowitz has requested additional National Guard in Brooklyn. Do you agree?""

Markowitz had called on the governor to ""allocate as many troops as possible"" to help the city’s ""brave — but overwhelmed — first responders.""

""There have been unfortunate incidents of looting in some locations,"" said Markowitz’s statement, published the day of Bloomberg’s news conference. ""All of our resources have been stretched to the limit, but in the name of public safety we need to send more National Guard personnel into Coney Island, Manhattan Beach, Gerritsen Beach, Red Hook and any other locations the governor deems appropriate.""

Bloomberg, who could formally request such help from the governor, disagreed. New York City didn’t need the help, he said.

Here’s what he told the reporter who asked about Markowitz’s National Guard request:

 ""No, we appreciate the help. The National Guard has been helpful, but the NYPD is the only people we want on the street with guns, and we don't need it. There has been one or two minor outbreakings, disgraceful though they may be, of looting reported in the paper, but the vast bulk of people are doing the right thing. And in Brooklyn people are safe the same way as they are in the rest of the city. We have the resources. The NYPD is 100 percent confident that we can protect the public. We've been doing this for an awful long time. You just have to take a look at the crime rate to understand how good a job this is. And the National Guard has plenty of responsibilities. There are plenty of locations upstate and into surrounding states where they don't have a police department the size of New York, and they can use help from the state, and that's where they should be.""

But even though the full context of his remarks indicates his reason was that the NYPD didn't need the help, the media pounced on his gun reference.

The NRA pointed us to a snippet from the Atlantic Wire, which covered the briefing live: ""3:19 p.m. ‘The NYPD is the only people we want on the street with guns,’ Bloomberg says when asked if he asked for National Guard help in Brooklyn.""

The NRA also noted that the next day, the Brooklyn Paper wrote that Bloomberg ""snubbed Borough President Markowitz’s impassioned plea to bring the National Guard to Hurricane Sandy-scarred Brooklyn — arguing that approving the Beep’s request would be a waste of federal manpower and turn the borough into a police state.""

Conservative media picked up the story from there:

• NewsBusters: ""Thursday Report: Bloomberg Wouldn't Let Guard Into Brooklyn Over Their Possession of Guns.""

• Fox Nation: ""Report: Bloomberg Denied National Guard Assistance In Brooklyn Because Of Their Possession Of Guns.""

• Hot Air: ""Bloomberg kept National Guard out of NYC because they had guns?""

• Breitbart: ""BLOOMBERG TO BROOKLYN: NATIONAL GUARD NOT ALLOWED WITH GUNS.""

Did Bloomberg refuse to allow the National Guard into the city? Not exactly.

He requested National Guard support from New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, and got it.

The day before Bloomberg’s news conference, Cuomo ""mobilized more than 2,300 Soldiers and Airmen"" to help, including in New York City. Several days later, Cuomo’s office announced that more than 3,300 members of the National Guard had been deployed, including 850 from out of state.

The out-of-state reinforcements were housed at Floyd Bennett Field — in southeast Brooklyn.

John McCarthy of Bloomberg’s office told PolitiFact that the National Guard was in the city ""before, during and after the storm.""

 Order and disorder

But LaPierre’s partly right: Bloomberg didn’t ask for National Guard troops ""to restore civil order.""

Law enforcement wasn’t part of their requested mission, said Eric Durr, director of public affairs for the New York State Division of Military and Naval Affairs.

Local government ran the show, requesting help from the state, he said. And Bloomberg didn’t ask for armed troops.

""Our soldiers were there to assist in storm recovery,"" Durr said. ""They were not carrying weapons.""

And that’s ""incredibly typical,"" said Durr, who joined the New York National Guard in 1988.

In the immediate aftermath of 9/11, for example, he didn’t carry a weapon.

Bloomberg’s office confirmed the mayor ""did not want security provided by anyone other than NYPD.""

Why?

""Because they are the best police force in the world,"" McCarthy said.

The city’s police force, with about 34,500 in uniform, is more than twice the size of the New York National Guard.

But LaPierre also suggested there was a loss of civil order that required restoration.

Just how much disorder was there?

According to Bloomberg’s office, Brooklyn borough president Markowitz, the New York Police Department and a congressman representing Brooklyn — not so much.

In the week after the storm, crime overall was down. Burglary was up.

The day Markowitz had appealed for more aid, the New York Times and New York Post had reported isolated looting in the evacuated Rockaways and Coney Island, with about two dozen arrests. The Post quoted unnamed sources describing people grabbing shirts from an Ann Taylor display, plus gadgets from a Brookstone store ""before cops arrived to stand guard.""

In response to LaPierre’s Daily Caller article, the Los Angeles Times reported that while crime overall dropped in the city after Sandy, there had been some spikes in burglary — 17 burglaries in a precinct that last year had eight and 14 burglaries in a precinct that last year had three.

But citywide, the Times reported, ""there was a drop of 17% in shootings, 47% in rapes, 22% in robberies, 18% in assaults, 45% in grand larceny, and 22% in stolen cars. The city also went a record eight days without a murder directly after Sandy.""

Rep. Hakeem S. Jeffries, a Democrat who represents New York’s Eighth District, wrote a letter to LaPierre, saying his ""suggestion that the residents of southern Brooklyn were in grave danger due to 'looters' that 'ran wild' is baseless.""

""I spent countless hours in the communities of Coney Island and Sea Gate. Nothing about your characterization of lawlessness rings true,"" Jeffries wrote.

And Markowitz, the borough president who had requested the National Guard help, wrote to LaPierre, ""Your assertion that ‘looters ran wild in South Brooklyn,’ proves just how totally ignorant you are of what’s really going on in Brooklyn and what’s really in the best interest of Brooklynites. Your perception of Hurricane Sandy is nothing but fiction.""

(Seemed a little harsh to us from the guy who had pointed out ""unfortunate incidents of looting in some locations."" But that’s certainly more reserved than ""looters ran wild."")

Our ruling

LaPierre described a ""hellish world"" in south Brooklyn after Hurricane Sandy where the mayor ""refused to allow the National Guard into the city to restore civil order because Guardsmen carry guns."" 
He is wrong that Bloomberg refused to allow the National Guard into the city -- troops were already there and more arrived in the days afterward. However, he's right that Bloomberg rejected an armed National Guard, although the full context of the mayor's remarks indicate his primary reason was he felt the NYPD was able to keep the peace without the Guard's help",Mostly False,"February 20, 2013"
"""There are more people killed with baseball bats and hammers than are killed with guns.""","
Some gun control critics are using a similar talking point in the national debate over this issue.

PolitiFact Georgia spotted two recent claims on the topic that show the importance of being precise when making an argument on an issue. One speaker got it right. The other person made a more general statement on guns and got it wrong. 
Our odyssey began when an interesting comment by a state senator started making the rounds at the Georgia Capitol and on Twitter.

""There's more murders with hammers last year than...shotguns and pistols and AK-47s,"" said state Sen. Bill Jackson, a Republican from Appling. 
Two days after Jackson’s statement, U.S. Rep. Paul Broun, a Republican from Athens, was quoted by Slate.com on the same topic.

""There are more people killed with baseball bats and hammers than are killed with guns,"" said Broun, who believes in limited government and is running for the U.S. Senate in 2014.

We quickly discovered our partners at other PolitiFact operations have examined similar claims before. Here’s what they found:

In January, some Facebook posts began to circulate that were critical of the White House’s proposal to restrict the availability of some weapons.

""Facts gun control advocates don’t want you to know. According to the FBI, in 2011, 1,694 were murdered with knives, 726 with hands or feet, 496 with clubs or hammers, 323 with rifles of any type. But Obama wants to ban semi-automatic rifles?"" it read.

The FBI figures also showed that 356 people were killed with shotguns.

PolitiFact reviewed 2011 FBI data on the types of weapons used to commit murders. The numbers posted on Facebook nearly matched the FBI data. The Facebook post of how many people were killed with hands or feet was two below the FBI total of 728.

A few weeks later, our partners at PolitiFact Texas examined a similar claim from that state’s attorney general, Greg Abbott.

""FBI: More people killed with hammers & clubs each year than rifles,"" Abbott said in a Twitter post.

He supplied a link to a Jan. 3, 2013, Fox News commentary piece that originated on the conservative website Breitbart.com and referred to FBI murder statistics from 2005 through 2011.

PolitiFact Texas noted Abbott used selective data to base his claim. That said, PolitiFact Texas noted, it is correct that FBI data indicates that in 2011, more people were killed with ""clubs and hammers"" than with any type of rifle. They rated his claim True.

Our efforts to reach Broun were unsuccessful.

Broun’s statement is not as specific as Jackson, whose claim we rated True, and the others. FBI data shows that 6,220 Americans were murdered by handguns in 2011. That’s more than 12 times the number of people killed with clubs or hammers, not including how many people were killed by other types of guns.

Broun’s claim that there are more people killed with baseball bats and hammers than are killed with guns was less specific. Broun’s general use of ""guns"" by its nature includes handguns. That makes his statement way off.

FBI statistics show that 8,583 people were killed with all guns in 2011 -- most of them (6,220) with handguns.

Broun is a congressman who has inserted himself directly into the heated gun debate. And he’s now running for the U.S. Senate. His high-profile run for higher office means that more of his statements will end up in the glare of the spotlight. And some of them could combust",False Pants on Fire,"February 20, 2013"
"Says ""overwhelming majorities of Americans"" support gun legislation ""like background checks.""","
President Barack Obama used his 2013 State of the Union address to urge Congress to vote on legislation to reduce gun violence.

Victims of recent attacks deserve it, he said, and voters support some ""common-sense reform.""

""Overwhelming majorities of Americans – Americans who believe in the 2nd Amendment – have come together around common-sense reform – like background checks that will make it harder for criminals to get their hands on a gun,"" he told lawmakers.

Do ""overwhelming majorities of Americans"" support gun legislation such as background checks?

 The evidence

Viewers who watched an enhanced version of Obama’s speech online at WhiteHouse.gov saw a graphic that said ""92 percent of Americans support background checks for gun buyers.""

It cited an independent poll from Quinnipiac University, which we quickly found on the university’s site.

The results from the phone poll of 1,772 registered voters in late January and early February 2013 were straightforward:

• It found 92 percent support for background checks for all gun buyers, which the Quinnipiac pollsters described as ""overwhelming.""

• It found 91 percent support for universal background checks among voters in a household with a gun.

Other polls we’ve cited in recent fact-checks also found high percentages of support for universal background checks, even among gun owners.

A Pew Research Center poll from Jan. 9-13, 2013, of 1,502 adults found 85 percent of Americans (and 85 percent of gun owners) favor making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks.

A CBS/New York Times poll conducted Jan. 11-15 among 1,110 adults showed that 92 percent of Americans (and 85 percent of respondents living in a household with an NRA member) support universal background checks.

Obama did cherry-pick the gun-control proposal on which consensus is strongest -- background checks. Other proposals he might also call ""common-sense,"" such as bans on assault weapons and high capacity magazines, held 56 percent support in the Quinnipiac poll. And they were narrowly opposed by voters in households with a gun, with 52 percent against such measures.

 Our ruling

Obama said ""overwhelming majorities of Americans"" support gun legislation ""like background checks."" The poll cited by the administration, as well as other independent polls in 2013, do show support for universal background checks above 80 percent among voters, even those who own guns.

But people would get the impression from Obama's statement that there is similar support for other White House gun proposals, when the reality is weaker majority support among voters and slim opposition among gun owners. That’s a point worth clarifying",Mostly True,"February 13, 2013"
There are twice as many gun shops as McDonald’s in the United States.,"
So what’s easier to find? The golden arches or a gun shop.

The Rev. Markel Hutchins, an Atlanta-based civil rights activist, had an answer during a recent discussion about federal gun legislation on ""The Ryan Cameron Show,"" which airs weekday mornings on V-103 FM in Atlanta.

""There are twice as many gun shops as McDonald’s,"" Hutchins said.

McDonald’s eateries are just about everywhere in America. PolitiFact Georgia was listening while stuck in traffic and wanted to find out whether Hutchins’ claim is true that there are more places to buy a gun than to grab a Happy Meal.

Hutchins wants laws to restrict the availability of handguns across the country, particularly in urban areas such as Atlanta. He led a rally last week outside the headquarters of gun manufacturer Glock, located in Smyrna, a northern suburb of Atlanta. Hutchins says gun rights advocates are distorting the intent of the Second Amendment, saying it was written to allow Americans to arm themselves to protect the nation.

There had been a spate of high-profile shootings in Atlanta a week before Hutchins’ interview. A 14-year-old boy was shot, allegedly by a 15-year-old boy, on the campus of an Atlanta middle school. The student who was wounded was not seriously injured. A day after that shooting, a Morehouse College student was shot inside a gym on the campus. The student was reportedly in stable condition and expected to make a full recovery.

Hutchins said he was indeed claiming that there are more gun shops nationwide than McDonald’s restaurants. Hutchins sent us an ABC News article published in mid-December to back up his claim and said he did some additional research because he didn’t believe it was true.

""My God, it was right there,"" he said.

The McDonald’s website contains a number of facts and figures, including how many restaurants there are in the country. The latest tally, as of 2011, was 14,098 in the United States. There were 33,510 worldwide, the website shows.

The number on the restaurant’s website matched what ABC reported. The news outlet reported there are 51,438 retail gun stores in America. Programs, such as American Public Media’s ""Marketplace,"" have reported the total is about 58,000. Some online research we did found others making similar claims that there are twice as many gun stores as McDonald’s in America.

Those numbers, however, are more complicated than they first appear.

What Hutchins and some news outlets have referred to as ""guns stores"" are actually federal permits issued to sell guns. Those could represent retail establishments that primarily sell guns, larger retail vendors (such as Wal-Mart) that sell guns as part of a much larger retail venue or pawnshops that carry guns as part of their inventory. The numbers also refer to people who sell guns at gun shows several times a year and have no bricks-and-mortar store.

We attempted to make an oranges-to-oranges comparison here -- to compare McDonald’s locations to free-standing stores that primarily sell guns.

It’s hard to find detailed data on actual gun stores online. The U.S. Census Bureau does not keep data on gun stores. Neither does the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

The U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms keeps a monthly log on its website of how many people and pawnbrokers are licensed to sell guns in the country and its territories. In January, the total was 58,725. About 51,000 of them were gun dealers. The rest were pawnbrokers. In Georgia, the total in January was 1,746.

In 2011, to be consistent with the most recent information we have about the number of McDonald’s restaurants nationwide, there were 56,059 federally licensed firearms dealers and pawnbrokers in the country. That’s quadruple the number of places to buy Chicken McNuggets.

The ATF does not track how many licensed dealers own a business that they sell guns from as opposed to those who may sell guns at a show. The ATF database has lists of every person licensed to sell guns. In Georgia, most people on the January list say they own a business. There were about 175 people on the list with a license who did not include the name of a business. About 100 of them are retail stores such as Wal-Mart, Dick’s Sporting Goods and Academy Sports & Outdoors.

In some cases, the list contains the name of the person licensed to sell guns and the business
itself.

The leader of an organization of firearms retailers had a lower estimate of how many gun shops there are nationally. Andrew Molchan, president of Professional Gun Retailers Association, believes there are probably 9,000 ""real"" gun stores in America. His definition of a gun store is a place that regularly sells the weapons year-round. His estimate did not include businesses such as Wal-Mart because some of those stores do not sell any guns.

Molchan said it’s tough to come up with a firm number of how many gun stores there are for several reasons. For example, he said some pawnshops sell only a handful of guns year-round.

""It’s not hard and crisp,"" Molchan said of coming up with an actual estimate of how many gun shops there are in the U.S.

When told about Hutchins’ claim, Molchan replied, ""That’s not necessarily wrong.""

Some people, he said, may have a license to sell guns, but they don’t sell any at all. He believes there are probably as many as 25,000 businesses that sell guns.

To sum up, Hutchins said there were twice as many gun shops than McDonald’s restaurants in the United States. There are numbers we found that support his argument.

But this claim, like many we’ve tackled, is not as simple as it seems. His overall point seems accurate -- there are a lot of places to buy guns in the United States",Mostly True,"February 11, 2013"
More than 40 percent of sales nationally are made without background checks.,"
In the aftermath of the mass killings at a Newtown, Conn., elementary school, U.S. Rep. David N. Cicilline, spoke at a Jan. 23 Rhode Island State House rally against gun violence about legislative efforts, including a bill he’s introduced to regulate gun sales.

TheFire Sale Loophole Closing Act would prevent gun dealers whose licenses have been revoked from declaring their inventory a ""personal collection,"" which allows them to make private sales without background checks.

At the rally, the Rhode Island Democrat said more than 40 percent of sales nationally are made without background checks, according to a story in The Providence Journal.

That 40-percent figure is mentioned often. Just two days before the Providence rally, New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand cited it in an interview on MSNBC. President Obama also mentioned it when he outlined his gun-control proposals last month.

Several PolitiFact affiliates have examined variations of the claim over the past year. PolitiFact National first checked a similar statement in July 2012 from New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.

PolitiFact National initially rated the claim Mostly True but re-examined it after the Newtown shootings and, based on additional reporting, changed the ruling to Half True.

For this item, we will summarize research done by PolitiFact affiliates, supplemented by our own reporting.

First, a little background.

Since 1994, federally licensed gun dealers have been required to verify that a buyer has not been convicted of a serious crime, declared mentally incompetent or is blocked for any of about 10 reasons.  
 
But the law doesn’t apply to private sellers at gun shows, flea markets, or people who post firearms for sale on the Internet. In those sales, there is no requirement for a  background check, and no one needs to file any paperwork.

So do those private sales account for 40 percent of all gun transactions? The source of that figure is a 1997 National Institute of Justice study, done by professors Philip Cook of Duke University and Jens Ludwig of the University of Chicago, who examined data from a 1994 telephone survey about gun ownership.

The survey, which sampled 2,568 homes, asked owners an array of questions, including how many guns were in the house, what they were used for, how they were stored and how they were obtained.

Of the 2,568 households surveyed, 251 people answered the question about the origin of their guns. Cook and Ludwig found that 35.7 percent of that group reported obtaining their guns from somewhere other than a licensed dealer. (That has been rounded up to 40 percent.)

In addition to the relatively small sample, there were other issues with the survey. Some respondents weren’t entirely sure whether the seller was a licensed dealer. In some cases, when the respondent skipped the question, the researchers made a judgment call.

The study, conducted by respected researchers, may have been the most reliable information in its time. What’s less clear is how reliable its findings are today.
The National Rifle Association, which opposes tighter gun controls, does not dispute the method or findings of the study but says the 40 percent claim is a misinterpretation by gun control advocates.

In January 2013, Politifact National asked Cook, one of the study’s authors, what he thought about the 40 percent figure being referenced so frequently in the current gun-control debate.

""I’ve been amazed at how much interest there’s been in it. It’s been lying there dormant for 20 years,"" he said.

So is it still a reliable estimate of secondary market gun sales?

""The answer is I have no idea,"" Cook said. ""This survey was done almost 20 years ago. … It’s clear there are a lot of transactions that are not through dealers. How many, we’re not really clear on it. … We would say it’s a very old number.""

Other scholars had similar views.

""I don’t see how anyone could know that number,"" James Jacobs of the Center for Research in Crime and Justice at New York University School of Law, told PolitiFact National.

One expert, David Kopel at the University of Denver law school, said he doesn’t think the figure was ever accurate because of what the survey actually asked.

On the other hand, three gun experts contacted by PolitiFact affiliates had different views.

""The 40 percent seems about right,"" said Robert McCrie, of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice.

University of Central Florida Prof. Jay Corzine, who has attended and studied gun shows in Florida, says that,  based on his observation, no more than 15 to 20 percent of sales at gun shows occur without a background check. But when you add in other private sales, the 40 percent figure is ""probably accurate"" and ""a very good figure to use.""

Gary Kleck, a Florida State University professor whose research has provided the foundation for less restrictive concealed carry laws, said conditions in the gun market haven’t changed much since the 1997 study was done.

Kleck says the 40 percent estimate is ""probably still reasonably valid today."" But he further argues that this fact shouldn’t guide new policy, because the problem is not how legal, background-checked purchasers are obtaining guns, but how criminals are.

We e-mailed links of the previous PolitiFact rulings to Cicilline’s office and asked whether the congressman had any new information to budge the Truth-O-Meter.

Richard Luchette, Cicilline’s communications director, responded in an e-mail noting that the figure came from the National Institute of Justice.

""As I'm sure you know, this is the most commonly cited statistic and most current report used by gun violence prevention advocates because there are a number of restrictions currently written into law that have prevented additional research from being performed on this issue,"" he said.

""We can go back and forth parsing this figure and looking at what other organizations have to say about it but I think you're missing the larger point,"" Luchette said. ""Our country has a serious problem with gun violence, especially with mass shootings.""

He said, ""Cicilline will remain focused on doing everything he can to address this problem.""

Our ruling

U.S. Rep. Cicilline said that more than 40 percent of gun sales nationally are made without background check.

Cicilline accurately quoted a figure that comes from a 15-year-old study, based on data that’s almost 20 years old.

Clearly, many gun sales are made without background checks. There’s no current, reliable data to estimate what percentage of sales are made that way and experts disagree on whether the 40-percent figure is still valid",Half True,"February 10, 2013"
"Says each year approximately 30,000 people in the United States die as a result of gunfire, and about 80,000 people are wounded.","
The pre-Christmas slaughter of 20 elementary school children and six adults at a Connecticut elementary school has renewed public debate over how to prevent future mass killings with guns.

On Jan. 14, members of the Congressional Black Caucus, now chaired by Warrensville Heights Democratic Rep. Marcia Fudge, weighed in on that question by delivering a series of speeches on the House of Representatives floor that decried a U.S. ""culture of violence.""

Newly elected Columbus Democratic Rep. Joyce Beatty used the opportunity to deliver her first oration on the House of Representatives floor. In it, she lamented that ""mass killings have gone from being an extremely rare occurrence to a common occurrence,"" and suggested the U.S re-examine its funding for mental health services, place adequate controls on ammunition and  ""ensure proper and tighter access to firearms.""

""According to Harvard Health Policy Review, each year approximately 30,000 people in the United States die as a result of gunfire, and about 80,000 people are wounded,"" the former Ohio state legislator noted, applauding President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden for ""proactively taking the necessary steps to address this critical issue.""


We wondered whether Beatty’s statistics were accurate, so we decided to track them down.

We soon found an article in the Fall 2001 issue of Harvard Health Policy Review, titled The Costs and Benefits of Reducing Gun Violence, that begins with the exact wording used by Beatty - ""Each year, approximately 30,000 people in the United States die as a result of gunfire and about 80,000 are wounded."" But the date of that article gave us pause. The numbers it cited were more than a decade old. We wanted to find more recent numbers.

We turned to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention statistics to verify the information. The latest available version of its data says there were 31,672 firearms deaths in the United States during 2010, a ratio of 10.3 deaths per 100,000 people. That number  is a bit higher than the number Harvard Health Policy Review cited in 2001, although it is certainly in the ballpark.

The second set of CDC data we examined tracks non-fatal gun injuries. By the CDC’s reckoning, there were 73,883 non-fatal firearm injuries in 2011, a rate of 23.7 injuries per 100,000 people. That number is a bit lower than the number Beatty cited from the Harvard Health Policy Review, although it isn’t too far off. If the number of non fatal injuries from BB or pellet guns were added into the mix, the number of injuries from 2011 would exceed Harvard’s estimate of 80,000 yearly wounds from gunfire. According to CDC, 16,451 people in the United States were hurt by pellet guns - about 5.3 incidents per 100,000 people.

Beatty accurately represented the statistics printed in Harvard Health Policy Review, even though its tally was more than a decade old. More recent data indicates those numbers haven’t changed much over the years",Mostly True,"February 8, 2013"
Says Gov. John Kasich can remove the president of the State Board of Education.,"
Re-posting an item from a friend on Facebook led to calls for the resignation of the president of the Ohio Board of Education, Debe Terhar.
Terhar, a Republican from Cincinnati, re-posted a photograph of Hitler with a caption reading: ""Never forget what this tyrant said: ‘To conquer a nation, first disarm its citizens.’ — Adolf Hitler.""

The Columbus Dispatch, reporting the story, said the item originated ""with the Facebook page of Uncle Sam’s Misguided Children, which features a variety of anti-Obama, pro-gun posts and pictures.""

After the story appeared, Terhar removed the material, and then closed her Facebook page. She issued a statement saying she was not comparing President Obama to Hitler, had not researched the posted material and had made no comment on it.

A little research might have saved a lot of trouble.

Our friends at the myth-busting site Snopes.com could not find any source documenting the purported Hitler quote. Neither could Salon.com, which pointed us to a 2004 paper by University of Chicago law professor Bernard Harcourt. He found the quote ""is probably a fraud and was likely never uttered."" (Harcourt further noted that the Weimar government immediately before Hitler’s had tougher gun laws than the Nazi regime.)

Terhar, who is married to Ohio Rep. Lou Terhar, said in a statement that she regretted ""the consequences of carelessly sharing"" the posted material and would be ""more selective in my use of social media in the future.""

Gov. John Kasich said he saw no need for further action.

""It was clearly a mistake, and she says it was a mistake,"" he told the Dispatch from the World Economic Forum in Switzerland. ""I’m glad that she’s come out and said she’s sorry about it, that it’s a mistake, and she’s not going to do it again.""

Ohio Democrats led calls for Terhar to resign. Ohio Democratic Party Chairman Chris Redfern went further in a statement.

""In absence of a full, formal apology from Terhar,"" Redfern said, ""Kasich has a duty to remove his hand-picked state school board president from office.""

A subsequent email from Redfern that solicited letters to Kasich and the school board demanding Terhar's resignation carried the subject line, ""Tell Kasich: Fire Terhar!""

PolitiFact Ohio wondered if Kasich had the power to do that. We called Redfern's office.

A party spokesman, Jerid Kurtz, told us that Redfern understands Kasich has no direct formal power to remove Terhar, but Kasich does have a bully pulpit as the state's most visible and arguably most powerful public figure. The governor should issue a statement of no confidence, rather than his initial ""no comment,"" and can pressure Terhar to resign as president, Kurtz said for Redfern.

Kurtz noted that Kasich showed power over the board two years ago by forcing out Superintendent Deborah Delisle, who resigned, citing pressure from the governor’s office.

The state superintendent serves at the discretion of the board. Delisle said in a letter to board members that Kasich’s administration had informed her that a majority of the board would replace her if she did not step down. The same day, Terhar was elected board president by fellow board members with Kasich’s support, reversing the outcome of a vote two months earlier.

Using that example, one would conclude that if Kasich wanted Terhar gone from the president’s chair, he has the influence to make it happen.

Removing her from the board altogether would be a different matter.

The board is made up of 19 members. Eleven are elected on a district basis, and eight are appointed by the governor.

Terhar, self-described as ""an early participant in the Tea Party,"" is an elected member from Cincinnati representing Hamilton and Warren counties. She started her four-year term on Jan. 1, 2011, was elected board president in March 2011 and re-elected unanimously by the board to the post last month.

Her seat on the board is not among the positions subject to removal at the pleasure of the governor under the Ohio Revised Code.

Under the code and the state constitution, in fact, Ohio lacks any provision for the recall of state officials.

So what's the verdict here?

Terhar posted a bogus quotation and false history. Whether there should be consequences is a matter of opinion that we can't rate. That includes calls for her resignation.

Redfern's statement that Kasich ""has a duty to remove"" her, however, means that Kasich has the power to do so.

The Democratic Party spokesman, explaining Redfern’s remarks, said the call for Terhar’s resignation or removal extended only to her position as school board president, not as a board member. That’s an important distinction.

He acknowledged that Kasich does not have statutory control over the Board of Education, but he accurately cited Kasich’s forcing out of a state school superintendent as a demonstration of the governor’s power over the board",Mostly True,"February 7, 2013"
"""A majority of Americans agree with"" a ban on assault weapons. ""And by the way, so did Ronald Reagan.""","About a month after a mass shooting in Newtown, Conn., left 20 schoolchildren and six adults dead, President Barack Obama rolled out a package of gun-control proposals during a speech with Vice President Joe Biden. The package included initiatives such as an assault-weapons ban that requires congressional approval, along with 23 executive actions that the president can implement on his own. The price tag for the package is estimated at $500 million.

In presenting the package, specifically the portion dealing with the assault-weapons ban, Obama made a point of conjuring past President Ronald Reagan’s stance on the same issue.

""Weapons designed for the theater of war have no place in a movie theater,"" Obama said during the speech. ""A majority of Americans agree with us on this. And, by the way, so did Ronald Reagan, one of the staunchest defenders of the Second Amendment, who wrote to Congress in 1994, urging them -- this is Ronald Reagan speaking -- urging them to listen to the American public and to the law-enforcement community and support a ban on the further manufacture of military-style assault weapons.""

Evoking past presidents is a frequent practice by politicians. Unfortunately, sometimes the context and the content of the recollections are incorrect. PolitiFact Georgia decided to check the accuracy of Obama’s statement, as well as whether most Americans support a ban on military-style assault weapons.

Obama pitched his gun plan at the White House surrounded by school-age children who had written letters to the president about the Newtown school shooting. In the audience were the parents of one of the students killed at Newtown’s Sandy Hook Elementary School, along with a survivor of the 2007 shooting massacre at Virginia Tech that left more than 30 people dead and an additional 15 wounded.

Against this emotional backdrop Obama’s plans drew immediate and intense reaction from supporting groups such as the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, as well as opponents such as the National Rifle Association.

Obama’s push for an assault-weapon’s ban hearkens to the original ban passed in 1994 that expired in 2004. At the time of that ban’s passage, Reagan -- who took office in 1981-- supported it. In a joint letter to The Boston Globe with Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford, the former presidents wrote, ""While we recognize that assault weapon legislation will not stop all assault weapon crime, statistics prove that we can dry up the supply of these guns, making them less accessible to criminals.""

Eight years before this letter in the newspaper supporting the assault-weapons ban, Reagan, who was then president, signed into law the Firearm Owners Protection Act, which was supported by gun rights advocates. In addition to providing protections for gun owners, the act also banned ownership of any fully automatic rifles that were not already registered on the day the law was signed.

These items provide a framework for Reagan’s actions around an assassination attempt on his life months after taking office in 1981. The shooting left Reagan wounded and presidential press secretary James Brady paralyzed. The shooting provided the impetus for the Brady Bill, introduced in 1987, that required background checks for gun purchasers and a waiting period before a buyer could take possession of a gun.

In a 1991 New York Times op-ed titled ""Why I’m For the Brady Bill,"" Reagan detailed his support of a seven-day waiting period for gun buyers. ""Every year, an average of 9,200 Americans are murdered by handguns, according to Department of Justice statistics,"" Reagan said in the op-ed. ""… If the passage of the Brady bill were to result in a reduction of only 10 or 15 percent of those numbers (and it could be a good deal greater), it would be well worth making it the law of the land.""

""Reagan supported the Brady Bill. That was after he had left office, but he did support it,"" said Allan Lichtman, a professor of history at American University. ""His views are a little complicated because he also signed legislation easing the (1968) Gun Control Act, so you can take Reagan either way.""

As for the president’s assessment that ""a majority of Americans agree"" with the assault-weapons ban, we went to the polls for answers.

A Washington Post/ABC News poll involving guns, politics and governing priorities was conducted by telephone Jan. 10-13. The poll included a random national sample of 1,001 adults, including land-line and cellphone-only respondents. The poll’s results have a margin of error of 3.5 percentage points.

The poll includes three pertinent questions about weapons bans:

-- Would you support or oppose a law requiring a nationwide ban on semi-automatic handguns, which automatically reload every time the trigger is pulled?
Fifty-one percent of all adults said yes; 46 percent said no. Fifty percent of registered voters said yes; 47 percent said no.

-- Would you support or oppose a law requiring a nationwide ban on high-capacity ammunition clips, meaning those containing more than 10 bullets?
Sixty-five percent of all adults said they supported a ban; 32 percent opposed. Those same numbers applied to registered voters.

-- Would you support or oppose a law requiring a nationwide ban on the sale of assault weapons?
Fifty-eight percent of all adults supported a ban; 39 percent opposed. Fifty-nine percent of registered voters supported a ban; 38 percent opposed.

So how does Obama’s statement rate?

During his speech laying out a package of gun-control proposals, the president evoked Reagan’s support of an assault-weapons ban. History shows that Reagan’s track record on guns is a winding road. He was a strong gun rights supporter who signed legislation easing an earlier gun law. But he also supported legislation for background checks and a waiting period for potential gun owners. He did support an assault-weapons ban and even joined two other former presidents in a letter to a major newspaper urging congressional approval of a ban.

Not only did Reagan support the ban, but so do most Americans, Obama said. Information from a Washington Post/ABC News poll supports the president’s statement",True,"February 5, 2013"
"40 percent of U.S. gun sales ""are occurring outside of"" licensed gun dealers.","
The implicit call to arms made by Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. led to a nationally televised quarrel over guns between Clarke and one of his political rivals, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett.

The two appeared Jan. 29, 2013 on Piers Morgan's prime-time talk show on CNN. Clarke spoke about the Milwaukee radio ad he aired five days earlier, in which he urged citizens to consider taking a firearms safety course in order to protect themselves from crime.

Barrett, who defeated Clarke and eight other candidates in the 2004 mayoral election, criticized the ad and what he characterized as the sheriff's position on gun control.

""Right now, he is defending laws that have a loophole that allow those individuals -- those individuals who have criminal record, mental health records, that are involuntary or domestic violence orders -- to go buy guns on private sales,"" Barrett said of Clarke. ""I need our sheriff to support the initiative that says that individuals who sell guns ensure that those guns are not being sold to criminals, they're not being sold to people of domestic violence orders and they're not being sold to people of involuntary mental judgment commitments.

""And I need that because 40 percent of the sales are occurring outside of gun dealers.""

Barrett was making the point that many gun sales -- such as those done at gun shows or over the Internet -- don't involve a criminal background check of the buyer because only licensed firearm dealers are required to do the checks.

But if so many gun sales are done without creating a government paper trail, is it even possible to know what percentage of guns aren't sold by licensed gun dealers?

Let’s see if Barrett is on target.

Barrett's evidence

Barrett is a founding member of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, which supports background checks for all gun sales. The group, though, hasn't always been as bold in making the claim Barrett did.

In one statement, the group said ""experts estimate"" that ""perhaps"" 40 percent of all sales are made by unlicensed private dealers who aren't required to do background checks. In another statement, the group puts the figure at more than 40 percent, but characterizes it as an estimate.

Like Barrett, scholars and news reports often state the figure without citing a source.

When we asked for Barrett’s evidence, the mayor’s chief of staff, Patrick Curley, cited a December 2011 statement by Mayors Against Illegal Guns. The statement attributes the 40 percent figure to the U.S. Department of Justice, but does not cite a particular source or study.

Curley also pointed out that in July 2012, when New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said 40 percent of guns are sold without a background check, PolitiFact National rated it Mostly True.

But new information has since emerged.

Newer claims, different ratings

Less than a week before Barrett made his claim, U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., made the same claim Bloomberg had.  

PolitiFact National rated Gillibrand’s claim Half True and at the same time changed the rating on Bloomberg’s claim to Half True.

Our colleagues said that after the Connecticut school shooting in December 2012, new criticism of the 40 percent figure emerged. Here are the highlights of what they found in assessing Gillibrand’s claim: 
The 40 percent figure grew out of a 1997 National Institute of Justice study that found that 35.7 percent of respondents in a 1994 telephone survey reported obtaining their gun from somewhere other than a licensed dealer. People citing the study have rounded up the figure to 40 percent. 
One of the authors of the study said he had ""no idea"" whether the 35.7 percent -- which he called a ""very old number"" -- was a reliable estimate for today. 
Two scholars said there is no way to know what the percentage is and one said the study was flawed. Two other experts said 40 percent is probably accurate. 
Also in January 2013, The Washington Post Fact Checker reassessed a claim by President Barack Obama, who said ""as many as"" 40 percent of all gun purchases are conducted without a background check.

Initially, the Fact Checker did not issue a rating on the statement. But after further review, Obama was given ""two Pinocchios"" out of a possible four -- the Fact Checker’s rating for a statement that contains ""significant omissions and/or exaggerations.""

Our rating

Barrett said 40 percent of U.S. gun sales ""are occurring outside of"" licensed gun dealers.

Like others, Barrett made the claim without saying that the study he relies is from 1997. And expert opinion on the figure he cites is mixed, at best",Half True,"February 4, 2013"
"In 2009, the FBI ""referred more than 71,000"" cases of people failing background checks when trying to buy a gun to another federal agency, ""but U.S. attorneys ultimately prosecuted only 77 of them.""","
Mayors Against Illegal Guns, which has intensified its efforts since mass shootings spiked in 2012, claims the U.S. rarely prosecutes felons and others who can't legally own a gun but are caught trying to buy one.

Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett is among the founding members of the group, which aired a TV ad in Milwaukee and other cities in January 2013 as part of its campaign to spur action by President Barack Obama and Congress. The group supports measures such as requiring every gun buyer to pass a criminal background check.

Regarding the prosecutions, Mayors Against Illegal Guns stated on its DemandaPlan.org website:

""It is a federal crime for felons and other prohibited gun purchasers to attempt to buy a gun. The (U.S.) Department of Justice, however, has not been prosecuting people who fail background checks at licensed gun dealers, leaving them free to buy from unlicensed sellers who don’t conduct checks – including largely anonymous Internet sales.""

The statement continued with a reference to one Department of Justice agency, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and Explosives (ATF), claiming:

""In 2009, the Federal Bureau of Investigation referred more than 71,000 such cases to ATF, but U.S. attorneys ultimately prosecuted only 77 of them.""

Let’s look into the disparity.

Gun background checks

When asked for backup, Erika Soto Lamb, spokeswoman for Mayors Against Illegal Guns, cited a 2011 report that was funded by the U.S. Department of Justice and produced by the Regional Justice Information Service in St. Louis, Mo.

The quasi-government agency’s report explains criminal background checks and gives statistics about attempted gun purchases in 2009 that were denied as a result of background check provisions in the federal Brady Act.

The Brady Act was adopted in 1993, 12 years after President Ronald Reagan; his press secretary, James Brady; and two law enforcement officers were shot and wounded in John Hinckley Jr.’s assassination attempt on Reagan.

The law requires a criminal history background check be done by the FBI or a state agency on persons who attempt to purchase a firearm from a licensed dealer. If the potential buyer fails the check, the gun sale is denied and the case is referred to the ATF.

Prosecutions

In 2009, the FBI conducted more than 6 million background checks and denied 71,010 of them (1.1 percent). The most common reasons were the applicant had a felony conviction or indictment, had a misdemeanor domestic violence conviction or was under a domestic violence restraining order.

So, Mayors Against Illegal Guns is correct on the first number it cited.

But that doesn’t means a crime occurred in all 71,000 cases.

Jennifer Karberg of the St. Louis research organization that did the report told us that if a person trying to buy a gun indicates on the application form that, for example, he is a felon, the application will simply be denied. On the other hand, if a felon lied on the form about his conviction, that’s a crime that could be prosecuted, she said.

Moreover, after further review, about one-fourth of the applications that are denied by the FBI are reversed after a determination that no denial should have been done, Karberg said.

So those cases also don’t involve a crime.

Of the more than 71,000 cases that were referred to ATF, the agency sent only 4,700 cases to its offices around the country for further investigation, according to the report by the St. Louis research organization. The rest of the denials did not meet guidelines for further investigation, or they were overturned after being reviewed.

Of the 4,700 cases that went on to ATF field offices, the vast majority were not referred to federal prosecutors for possible criminal charges, the report says. The most common reasons were ""no prosecutive merit,"" federal or state guidelines weren’t met, or the applicant should not have been denied in the first place.

Ultimately, the field offices asked U.S. attorney’s offices (there are two in Wisconsin) to file a total of 140 criminal charges. From there, only 77 charges were filed. The most common charges were submitting false information on the gun purchase application or being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm.

Karberg told us the 77 charges likely involved fewer than 77 individual cases, given that multiple charges could be filed in some cases.

The author of the report, Ronald Frandsen, indicated to The Washington Post Fact Checker that the low rate of prosecution is the result of the priority given to such cases. And the Fact Checker said there is a troubling lack of detailed data that might clarify why few cases were referred for prosecution.

Mayors Against Illegal Guns argues that more cases could be prosecuted.

The group cited a 2004 Department of Justice review of enforcement of the Brady Act. The report found that ATF was referring ""standard denial"" cases to its field offices that ""were not likely to be prosecuted."" But it also said that historically, federal prosecutors ""have been unsuccessful in achieving convictions in many of these cases and consequently have been unwilling to expend their limited resources on prosecuting"" them.

The report went on to explain why prosecutors may not want to file charges in certain cases: A person prohibited from buying a gun may have committed a felony that was not violent or was committed many years ago; a prohibited person might be trying to buy a hunting rifle; and it’s difficult to prove that the prohibited person was aware of the prohibition and intentionally lied on his application.

So, there are indications that federal law enforcement authorities could file more criminal charges in cases in which a gun purchase application is denied. But it’s also clear that large numbers of the denials don’t involve any crime at all and some cases are not provable.

"""As a result of National Rifle Association and other private-sector (safety-education) programs, fatal firearms accidents are at the lowest level in 100 years.""","
During a closely watched Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on gun policy on Jan. 31, 2013, National Rifle Association executive director Wayne LaPierre offered several statistics designed to bolster his group’s position against gun control.
   
Here’s one claim that caught our eye:
   
""Teaching safe and responsible gun ownership works, and the NRA has a long and proud history of doing exactly that,"" LaPierre said. ""Our Eddie Eagle Child Safety Program has taught 25 million young people that if they see a gun, they should do four things: stop, don't touch it, leave the area, and call an adult. As a result of this and other private-sector programs, fatal firearms accidents are at the lowest level in 100 years.""
       
Let’s take a look at two parts of LaPierre’s comment -- the numerical claim that accidental shooting deaths have declined, and the question of whether NRA safety programs made a difference.

Are ""fatal firearms accidents … at the lowest level in 100 years""?

To check this part of the claim, we turned to a massive compendium of data produced annually by the National Safety Council, a nonprofit, congressionally chartered organization. The group issues an annual report that includes a category called ""unintentional injury deaths"" -- with data going all the way back to 1903.
   
The most recent version of the ""Injury Facts"" report available on the Internet is the 2011 edition, with data up to 2009. But we were able to obtain draft data from the council that offers preliminary data for as recently as 2011 (numbers that the group says are subject to refinement).
   
According to council data, the total number of unintentional deaths from firearms sank to 554 in 2009 -- easily the lowest of any year back to 1903.
   
In fact, it took from 1903 all the way until 1997 for the number of unintentional gunfire deaths to drop below 1,000. The all-time highs came in 1929 and 1930, when the number of such deaths reached 3,200 for two consecutive years.
   
This decline is all the more striking considering the increase in population over this period. In 1904, there were 3.4 unintentional firearm deaths per 100,000 people. By 2009, that rate had fallen to 0.2 deaths per 100,000 in people.
   
However, the data for unintentional gun deaths ticked up modestly in 2010, to 606, and then fell slightly to 600 in 2011.
   
So LaPierre was very close to correct -- 2009 represented a record low, but the number was slightly higher in both 2010 and 2011, at least according to preliminary data.
   
Did safety education programs by the National Rifle Association and other groups help reduce accidental gun deaths?

In a 2004 paper in the journal Pediatrics, researchers studied two child-safety programs, including the NRA’s Eddie Eagle. They concluded that Eddie Eagle was ""effective for teaching children to reproduce verbally the gun-safety message … but the skills were not used when the children were assessed via real-life"" situations. (Separately, gun-control advocates have complained that the Eddie Eagle program, whatever its safety benefits, helps recruit new generations of children into the NRA’s approach to guns.)

However, the study should be taken with a grain of salt: Pediatrics is published by the American Academy of Pediatrics, a group that, at the time the paper was published, was on record supporting ""regulation of the manufacture, sale, purchase, ownership, and use of firearms; a ban on handguns and semiautomatic assault weapons; and expanded regulations of handguns for civilian use."" (The group reaffirmed that position in 2012.)

We did not hear back from the NRA for this story, but several independent experts said they feel the NRA programs and others like it probably did help contribute to the decline in accidental gun deaths.

""I taught my children these same principles when they were very young so they had a way to evaluate the situation,"" said Mark E. Safarik, executive director of Forensic Behavioral Services Inc. and a former member of the FBI Behavioral Analysis Unit. ""If the gun safety course teaches those principles, then it has to have had an effect.""

Jay Corzine, a sociologist at the University of Central Florida, agreed that such programs probably made a difference.

""Overall, I believe the NRA should be commended for its firearm safety programs,"" Corzine said. ""It is a certain that they have prevented some accidental shootings and deaths.""

That said, Corzine cautioned against giving Eddie Eagle too much credit for the drop. Corzine pointed to a 2002 study in the journal Homicide Studies that suggested an entirely different rationale for the drop: improved medical care, particularly for trauma victims. The authors of that study wrote that ""we have garnered considerable support for the hypothesis that advances in emergency medical care have greatly and increasingly reduced the lethality of violent assaults.""

In an interview, Billie Weiss, an epidemiologist at the UCLA School of Public Health, pointed to former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., as an example of the advances in medical treatment. Giffords was shot in the head at a public gathering in January 2011. While she still faces a difficult road to recovery, Giffords survived the shooting. ""Ten years ago, she most certainly would not have lived after her injury,"" Weiss said.

To factor out improvements in trauma care, Corzine said it’s better to use a different data set than the one LaPierre used. Rather than focusing on accidental deaths from gunfire, Corzine said, look at accidental injuries from gunfire instead.

The National Safety Council’s annual report doesn’t include such data, but the CDC makes it available. We found that unintentional gunfire injuries have also been declining -- by about 20 percent between 2001 and 2010. That’s somewhat slower than the decline in unintentional gunfire deaths over the same period, which was 24 percent. But it’s not dramatically different. (As with the figures for unintentional gunfire deaths, the number for unintentional gunfire injuries ticked up slightly in 2011.)

What may be more relevant is that the incidents LaPierre cited -- unintentional deaths from gunfire -- only amounted to about 600 cases in 2010, compared to 14,161 cases of unintentional gunshot injuries that didn’t lead to death. In addition, there were 53,738 gunshot injuries caused by intentional assault in that year and another 4,643 non-fatal gunshot injuries caused by suicide attempts.

In other words, the roughly 600 unintentional gunshot deaths LaPierre cited in his testimony accounts for only a tiny proportion of all gun-related deaths and injuries -- less than half of one percent, to be precise.

Indeed, just looking at gunfire deaths, the trend lines for unintentional and intentional fatalities have been moving in opposite directions. Back in 1968, intentional gunfire deaths outpaced unintentional deaths by a ratio of 10 to 1. By 2009, that gap had expanded significantly, with intentional deaths exceeding unintentional deaths by a factor of more than 50 to 1.
   
So while LaPierre worded his statistic carefully and in a way that was very close to accurate, he chose to focus on a tiny subset of gun-related harm while ignoring the vast majority of gun-related deaths.
   
Our ruling
   
LaPierre was very close to being right about his carefully framed statistic: Despite significant population growth, unintentional firearms deaths fell to a 106-year low in 2009 before tracking up slightly in 2010. But while LaPierre is probably right that NRA-sponsored safety programs played a role in this decline, improvements in trauma care -- something LaPierre didn’t cite -- likely played as big a role as well, if not a bigger role",Half True,"February 1, 2013"
"""States have cumulatively cut over $1.8 billion from their mental health services between 2009 and 2011. This is the largest reduction in state mental health services in half a century.""","
As funerals proceeded for the 20 first-graders and six school employees massacred on Dec. 14, by a gunman at Connecticut’s Sandy Hook Elementary School, members of Congress including Toledo Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur took to the House of Representatives floor to decry the violence.

Kaptur’s speech highlighted cuts in mental health funding during the recession, while urging a ""more constructive federal role in assuring proper and early diagnosis and intervention of affected youth and appropriate treatment.""

During her speech, Kaptur said that ""states have cumultatively cut over $1.8 billion from their mental health services between 2009 and 2011. This is the largest reduction in state mental health services in half a century.""

PolitiFact Ohio took a look at the numbers.

Kaptur specifically cited the National Alliance on Mental Illness during her speech as a source of information. Her spokesman said she was citing data from a report the mental health advocacy group released in March 2011, after a paranoid schizophrenic gunman shot then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and killed six others in a supermarket parking lot outside Tucson, Ariz. The report observed that ""the public often focuses on mental illness only when high visibility tragedies of the magnitude of Tucson or Virginia Tech occur.""

""Between 2009 and 2011, states cumulatively cut more than $1.8 billion from their budgets for services for children and adults living with mental illness,"" it continued. The report said that cuts during that period kept thousands of Ohioans with serious mental illness from accessing care in their communities, resulting in their living on the streets, or ending up in more expensive settings like jails and hospitals.

The NAMI report stressed that people living with mental illness are, on the whole, no more violent than the rest of the population and are more frequently the victims of violence than perpetrators of violent acts. But it said the ""risks of violence among a small subset of individuals may increase when appropriate treatment and supports are not available.""

In an email, NAMI spokesman Bob Carolla noted the 2011 report that Kaptur cited was based on funding information available from states at the time the report was issued. The National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors subsequently determined that total cuts were much higher than the figures cited in the NAMI report - $4.35 billion between 2009 and 2012.

""The economic downturn has forced state budgets to cut approximately $4.35 billion in public mental health spending over the 2009-2012 period – the largest combined reduction since de-institutionalization,"" says a March 2012 report from the mental health program directors group.

A year-by-year breakdown in that report says that $1.22 billion in was cut in FY 2009 in the 39 states that provided statistics to the organization; that $1.02 billion was cut in FY 2010 by 38 states, that $1.27 billion was cut in FY 2011 by 36 states, and $842 million was cut in FY 2012 by 31 states.

Carolla said his organization accepts the accuracy of the mental health program directors group’s figures. He noted that de-institutionalization, which shifted mental health care from institutions like mental hospitals to community-based settings, ""is generally considered to have begun with the passage of legislation under President Kennedy in 1963 - 50 years ago."" That coincides with the half-century timeline cited in Kaptur’s speech.

When asked for details on the comparison of current cuts with those that happened when de-institutionalization occurred, representatives of the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors said their funding statistics go back only 30 years. While they believe the statement about the cuts’ scope is probably correct, they can’t precisely compare the deinstitutionalization era’s budgetary cuts with today’s numbers.

""It is by far the biggest cut in 30 years, but before that, the data doesn’t exist in a format where I can look at it and say it is apples to apples,"" says Ted Lutterman, the director of research analysis for the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors Research Institute. He said he did not provide the information on deinstitutionalization that Kaptur cited, and said that someone else must have inserted that tidbit into the group’s report.

Robert Glover, who heads the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors Research, also could not provide details on the half-century figure that Kaptur cited, though he said the recent budget cuts are the largest he’s seen during his 40 years in the profession. He calls the $4.35 billion statistic that his group uses  ""very conservative"" because it omits numbers from several states that didn’t provide the group with their budget figures. He observed that mental health needs rise when financial problems fester in a sour economy and that mental health service cuts make it harder for those with difficulties to get the help they need.

Glover says Ohio has provided a bright spot amid the cuts, developing programs designed to integrate mental health care with physical health care.

""There are pockets of restoration in some states,"" Glover said.

Ohio Department of Mental Health Communications Director Trudy Sharp said her organization’s general revenue budget went down by $67 million between the 2009 and 2010 fiscal years, then increased by $20 million in the 2011 fiscal year. She said her department trimmed its central office staff by 20 percent since 2008, and also shuttered three of the state’s nine psychiatric hospitals. Facilities in Cambridge, Cleveland and Dayton were closed and their beds absorbed by other hospitals, she said. Additionally, she said Ohio is consolidating its Department of Mental Health with its Department of Alcohol and Drug Addiction services, and trying to stretch its mental health dollars by encouraging regional planning approaches between counties.

So where does all this leave Kaptur’s statement?

Kaptur accurately cited statistics about mental health budget cuts from a National Alliance on Mental Illness report. Those numbers appear to have downplayed the extent of cuts. But, her claim that ""over $1.8 billion"" was cut between 2009 and 2011 is accurate because the cuts surely exceeded $1.8 billion.

Her contention that the cuts mark the ""largest reduction in state mental health services in half a century,"" is harder to prove.

She based her statement on information in a report produced by an often-cited authority on state mental health funding. While representatives of the group said they believe that statement is accurate, they acknowledged they didn’t have state funding numbers going back 50 years to document that assertion.

That’s a point of clarification",Mostly True,"February 1, 2013"
"Says ""the jurisdictions with the strictest gun control laws, almost without exception … have the highest crime rates and the highest murder rates.""","
Crime statistics prove that gun control laws don’t work, according to Texas’ junior U.S. senator, Ted Cruz, who has made several such statements since his January 2013 swearing-in.

Cruz, a Republican, declared such a pattern in a Senate hearing Jan. 30, 2013. Earlier, he said in a Jan. 7, 2013, PBS ""Newshour"" interview: ""If you look at the jurisdictions with the strictest gun control laws, almost without exception, they have the highest crime rates and the highest murder rates.""

Is that so?

PolitiFact checked a similar statement in February 2011, when National Rifle Association leader Wayne LaPierre said that ""violent crime in jurisdictions that recognize the right to carry (firearms for personal protection) is lower than in areas that prevent it.""

LaPierre’s claim was rated False. After looking at information from interest groups, a federal research center and the FBI, PolitiFact concluded, ""We don't see any evidence that state gun laws correlate with violent crime rates one way or the other."" 
We asked Cruz spokesman Sean Rushton for backup on the senator’s statement. He emailed us links to news stories, commentary pieces and research.

The material most directly related to the Cruz claim -- that stricter laws coincide with higher murder/crime rates -- boiled down to: 
By phone, Rushton singled out research by Lott, an economist and author of ""More Guns, Less Crime,"" which concluded that crime rates dropped in U.S. states and counties after ""right to carry"" laws were passed. PolitiFact mentioned Lott’s work in its LaPierre fact-check, but also noted it had been contradicted by other research, such as a 2004 review in which the National Research Council of the National Academies of science, engineering and medicine concluded data available at the time did not show any ""link between right-to-carry laws and changes in crime.""

Cruz’s materials covered a range of ""jurisdictions"" from local to international, but gave limited or case-by-case evidence rather than comprehensive or across-the-board comparisons.

They also illustrated a significant issue regarding such claims: Plenty of gun/crime research is out there, but with so many variables that comparisons are difficult.

One example: A Dec. 14, 2012, Washington Post blog entry said economist Richard Florida found that ""states with tighter gun-control laws appear to have fewer gun-related deaths."" Sounds like it disproves Cruz’s claim, right?

Well, but: Cruz specified crime and murder rates; Florida’s basis was the rate of firearm deaths (not limited to crime, thus including suicides and accidents). Cruz and the Post both talked about tight gun laws, but Cruz’s claim was not specific (Rushton later said he meant gun bans) while Florida identified states as ""stricter"" if they had any one of three specific gun laws (assault weapon ban, trigger lock law or safe storage requirement).

In other words, gun/crime data can be used to construct statements that appear to prove diametrically opposed points.  

Another big caveat: Just because two conditions crop up together (i.e., they correlate) doesn’t mean one caused the other. Many firearms studies and news stories we reviewed included a statement to that effect -- and then went ahead and plunked down the stats together anyway.

And all that’s before you get to the issue of whether political bias has affected the research.
  
Cruz’s claim is bold: Strict laws ""almost without exception"" correlate with the ""highest"" crime and murder rates, he said.

Seeking a common-sense way to test that, we compared state-by-state FBI crime statistics, as PolitiFact did in 2011. State laws cover a lot of territory, because local gun laws can’t be stricter than state laws in most of the U.S., according to the NRA-ILA and Florida State University criminology professor Gary Kleck, who spoke with us via email.

To determine states which had the tightest gun laws, we looked at three tallies: one each from the NRA and two gun-control advocacy groups, the Washington-based Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and the San Francisco-based Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.

Kleck pointed us to the NRA’s ""Compendium of State Firearms Laws,"" which showed 11 states with four or more restrictions as of July 9, 2010. Nine of those made the Top Ten on Brady’s 2011 gun-law scorecard and the Law Center’s list of ""10 states with the strongest gun laws.""

The nine: California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Rhode Island.

We charted crime and murder rates per 100,000 residents for those states using the FBI’s most recent complete Uniform Crime Reports: 2011. 

The FBI discourages using its crime report data to create rankings, and in any case our method here is flawed. Kleck and Lott described for us how a ""cross-sectional"" study like this -- checking many places at one point in time -- misses history that might be relevant; for example, information on whether local crime was already high or low before a gun law passed. 
Looking at states also excludes two Cruz-proferred examples: Washington, D.C., and Chicago. National Public Radio reporter Carrie Johnson summarized those situations in a Jan. 18, 2013, broadcast: 
""There were two places in the country ... that still had sweeping bans on handguns. They were Chicago and Washington, D.C. But the Supreme Court in a pair of cases in 2008 and 2010 threw out those sweeping bans, so no more outright bans on handgun ownership in these places, but still some pretty tight restrictions. It's worth noting … homicide rates for D.C. are at record or near-record lows as of 2012, but Chicago had a sharp spike in murders last year."" 

We took the U.S. Census’ 25 largest cities as of July 1, 2011, and looked at their 2011 FBI statistics. Detroit, Baltimore, Philadelphia and Memphis, Tenn., each had higher murder rates than D.C. and Chicago. Crime rates did not compare as neatly, because Chicago’s data for rape (and thus for total violent crime) are excluded for reporting differences. Though property crime rate isn’t a perfect substitute in a discussion about guns and the law, we checked anyway and found that D.C. had the 12th and Chicago the 14th highest property crime rates among the 25 biggest cities.

Going from the micro level to the macro: International comparisons are tricky because many factors vary, from data collection methods to countries’ cultural backgrounds. Laws aren’t uniform either, said Sarah Parker, a co-author of the annual Small Arms Study compiled by the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva, Switzerland.

By email, Parker named a few countries with some of the strictest gun controls: Australia, Japan, Singapore, South Africa and the United Kingdom.

We checked United Nations homicide rates for 2008 in 187 countries, which ranged from 61.3 murders per 100,000 citizens in Honduras down to zero murders in Palau, Iceland and Monaco. Among the ""strict"" nations that Parker suggested, four were low (UK, 1.3 murders per 100,000; Australia, 1.2; Japan, 0.5; Singapore, 0.4) and one was high -- 10th overall, in fact (South Africa, 36.8).

Cruz said that ""almost without exception,"" locales with the tightest gun laws have the highest crime and murder rates.

"Says since Australia passed tough gun laws, ""homicides by firearm have declined almost 60 percent.""","
Author Stephen King once asked his publisher to pull one of his novels off the shelves.

Six people had died  — in real life.

Four boys in 10 years brought guns to school. One killed a teacher and two students. Another shot five members of a prayer group, killing three. All four teenagers had read Rage, a book King wrote when he was a teen himself and published under another name.

King, in a blunt, impassioned essay, wrote that when he learned of the copycat crimes, he wanted the book off the market. He argues the United States should do the same for assault weapons.

""You don’t leave a can of gasoline where a boy with firebug tendencies can lay hands on it,"" he said in the 25-page piece, published Jan. 25, 2013, for Amazon Kindle readers.

King, a Democrat who says he owns three handguns and supports the Second Amendment, argues stricter gun control ""would save thousands of lives."" (His earnings from the sale of the essay will go the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence.) He says Australia shows it’s possible.

In 1996, 28-year-old Martin Bryant shot and killed 35 people near the Port Arthur historic site, a popular tourist destination. After the shootings, the country banned and bought up automatic and semi-automatic long guns, destroying at least 600,000 in 12 months — ultimately about a third of its privately owned guns.

It worked, King argues.

""Since the (Martin) Bryant killings and the resulting tough gun laws, homicides by firearm have declined almost 60 percent in Australia. The guns-for-everyone advocates hate that statistic, and dispute it, but as Bill Clinton likes to say, it's not opinion. It's arithmetic, honey.""

He likes talking to ""honey."" He also drops a few F-bombs.

We wanted to know: Have homicides by firearm in Australia dropped almost 60 percent? And did those ""tough gun laws"" do it?

 ‘It’s arithmetic, honey’

We asked King and Australian and American experts in gun violence for evidence.

By a few different measures, the arithmetic works. Homicides by firearm did decline after 1996 — in fact, had already been in decline.

One path to ""almost 60 percent"" comes from statistics compiled in part by Philip Alpers, a public health professor at the University of Sydney. The number of gun homicides fell from 69 in 1996 (excluding the 35 victims of the mass shooting prompting the laws) to 30 in 2012.  

That’s a decrease of 56.5 percent.

(And, yes, you read those numbers right — we didn’t miss any zeros. The United States has about the same number of gun homicides every day as happened in Australia last year.)

Then there’s King’s source, an item from Slate.com, he told us. It was a blog post citing a blog post citing a study —  a reputable peer-reviewed piece in the American Law and Economics Review.

The researchers, Andrew Leigh of Australian National University and Christine Neill of Wilfrid Laurier University, found that in the decade after the gun laws, firearm homicides dropped 59 percent.

So, on the numbers, King has strong support.

But did the 1996 laws drive the numbers? That’s more vexing.

""He could be right. Or he could be wrong,"" said David Hemenway, director of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center who wrote a helpful 2011 summary of the evidence. "" … The true answer is, we really don't know.""

Leigh and Neill designed their study to test for the law’s effect. They asked whether death rates dropped more in states that destroyed relatively more banned weapons through gun buybacks.

They found the buyback program drove down firearm suicides by almost 80 percent, with no significant change in suicides that didn’t use guns. But the effect on homicides, while of ""similar magnitude,"" was less precise, they wrote — perhaps between 35 and 50 percent.

Two other studies, which Hemenway described as flawed, found the laws made little difference.  But their design made it nearly impossible to find an effect, he argues.

The first, authored by members of the Australian gun lobby, highlighted the fact that before the law passed, the firearm homicide rate was already dropping. If it had continued on that track, they found, that would explain the entire change — showing the law made no difference. The authors cherry-picked a high year for homicides to start their analysis, then assumed deaths would drop at the same linear rate forever — with negative deaths by 2015.

The second study was more sophisticated. Authors searched for a shift in deaths in a single year that might be attributed to the law, and found their tests suggested the law didn’t ""have any large effects on reducing firearm homicide or suicide rates."" Hemenway answers that the buyback occurred over two calendar years, in 1996 and 1997 — and the two-year drop was substantial. Gun homicides fell 46 percent.

Australian experts told us the science leans King’s way. But it’s not yet definitive.

""The truth is that gun homicide did decline substantially after the toughening of Australia's gun laws and the massive gun buyback,"" said Don Weatherburn, director of the New South Wales Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research. ""The complication is that gun homicide was coming down before any of this. The academic debate is about whether the downward trend accelerated.""

His own view? That there’s some evidence that tougher gun laws reduced the homicide rate, but it is ""far from conclusive.""

Paul Mazerolle, director of the Violence Research and Prevention Program at Griffith University in Brisbane, echoed that ""more definitive work is required.""

Some feel more certain the laws did their job.

Simon Chapman, a professor of public health at the University of Sydney, co-authored a 2006 study showing faster falls in firearm deaths after the laws.

""Six years on, there still has not been a massacre,"" he told PolitiFact.

But an even messier question is whether similar laws would work in the United States. Australia doesn’t have domestic gun manufacturers —  and has the benefit of being, you know, an island. Guns destroyed aren’t so easily replaced.

 Our ruling

King, urging his readers to support an American assault weapons ban, said that since Australia passed tough gun laws, ""homicides by firearm have declined almost 60 percent."" The raw numbers back him up — but cause and effect are much peskier questions. Scholars we spoke with say the evidence leans King’s way, but is less than conclusive.

"""I had to lay off 48 people last year,"" which has exacerbated the lack of law enforcement officers in the county that respond quickly to crime calls.","
When Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. called on citizens to learn to use guns to defend themselves, he said fewer cops on the street meant that ""simply calling 911 and waiting is no longer your best option."" 
The same day, Jan. 25, 2013, he elaborated on the radio spot. He told conservative talk show host Vicki McKenna on WISN-AM (1130) in Milwaukee: 
""We need a new model. We're still operating -- when I say we, in law enforcement -- are operating under an old model that was actually developed in the 1980s. It was called rapid response. Law enforcement officials convinced city leaders to spend a lot of money hiring new officers and they promised that they could get to calls quickly; that's why it was called the rapid response model. 
""And the elected officials, they went along with it and there was this big hiring of police officers that went on in the ’80s. And there were, at that time, there were enough people to get to calls in a reasonable period of time. 
""Well since then, obviously, budgets, budget considerations -- cops have been laid off, fewer dollars going into public safety; my own agency, I had to lay off 48 people last year."" 
So, are there 48 fewer sheriff’s deputies responding to urgent crime calls? 
Most laid off were rehired 
Clarke’s 30-second public service announcement made national news. He did TV interviews on CNN, Fox and again on CNN, as well as a radio interview with conservative talk show host Sean Hannity. He repeated his claim about layoffs, though he used a smaller figure than the 48 he cited in the McKenna interview. 
Clarke refused our request to back up for his claim about 48 layoffs. 
We went to the files. 
Because of a budget cut imposed by Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele, Clarke was forced to do 48 layoffs in February 2012, according to a news article in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. At the time, Clarke’s spokeswoman said no decisions had been made on whether any tasks of the sheriff's office would be curtailed. 
Seven months later, Clarke said he was rehiring 29 of the deputies because staffing at the county jail was dangerously low. 
There was no mention of lacking deputies to respond to urgent calls about crime. 
The number actually rehired as of October 2012 was 25, according to a list provided by Abele’s office. 
It’s important to note that while the 48 layoffs number was correct, Clarke presented it as if that number was what was currently having a detriment on response times. That is, as if it was the situation as it exists today. It does not, given that more than half of the layoffs have been restored. 
What’s more, the indication is that the layoffs were in jail positions, not among deputies who may be called on to respond to serious crimes. 
Role of sheriff 
Even if the layoffs affected deputies who respond to serious crimes, the fact is the Sheriff’s Office handles only a small percentage of such calls in Milwaukee County. 
The Sheriff’s Office runs two jails, patrols freeways and provides security for the airport, the courthouse and other facilities. But in terms of crime fighting, its territory is generally limited to properties owned by the county, such as parks. Milwaukee County is heavily urbanized and municipalities have their own police departments that respond to crime calls. 
In 2010, according to the state Office of Justice Assistance, the Sheriff’s Office responded to just 10 violent crimes. That jumped to 163 in 2011. But the 163 represented just 2 percent of the 7,380 violent crimes (murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault) reported throughout the county in 2011. 
Similarly, the Sheriff’s Office handled 224 property crimes (burglary, theft, motor vehicle theft, arson) in 2011. That was up from 28 in 2010, but comprised less than 1 percent of the 43,615 property crimes in the county. 
Suffice it to say: If a person in Milwaukee County calls 911 about a serious crime in progress, in the vast majority of cases, a police officer and not a sheriff’s deputy would respond. So, again, the linkage Clarke makes between the layoffs and response times falls flat. 
Our rating 
Clarke said: ""I had to lay off 48 people last year,"" which has exacerbated the lack of law enforcement officers in the county that respond quickly to crime calls. 
The Sheriff’s Office did lay off 48 people in 2012, but most have been rehired. Moreover, the office handles only a fraction of serious crimes in Milwaukee",Mostly False,"January 31, 2013"
"Says according to the FBI, more people are killed each year with hammers and clubs than rifles.","
Not long before President Barack Obama’s Jan. 16, 2013, speech calling for more gun control measures, Texas’ attorney general tweeted about a different class of assault weapons.

Greg Abbott wrote, ""FBI: More people killed with hammers & clubs each year than rifles,"" and supplied a link to a Jan. 3, 2013, Fox News commentary piece that originated on Breitbart.com and referred to FBI murder statistics from 2005 through 2011.

PolitiFact in Washington, D.C., recently tackled a similar claim culled from Facebook: 



Obama was on the record supporting bans on certain semi-automatic rifles before his Jan. 16 speech, in which he again called for renewing the 1994-2004 federal ""assault weapons"" ban while urging education, mental health and other measures to reduce gun violence.

Like Abbott’s tweet, the Facebook post cited the FBI. PolitiFact looked at the bureau’s annual report on ""Crime in the United States,"" a collection of data from local agencies on several categories of crimes.

The Facebook post earned a ""True"" rating because it reflected the FBI’s statistics from 2011, the most recent year available, for murders with knives (1,694), personal weapons (728, typed on Facebook as 726), blunt objects (496) and rifles (323).

The Facebook post did not include homicides the FBI attributed to handguns (6,220), firearms whose type was not stated (1,587) and ""other guns"" (97). Those numbers mean handguns were used in 72 percent of all firearm murders in 2011 and slightly under half of all murders using any kind of weapon that year.

Abbott’s tweet, similarly, did not include some FBI-tracked categories by referring solely to rifles and blunt objects and leaving out other significant firearm categories. Still, according to the FBI’s data covering 2005 through 2011, blunt objects such as clubs and hammers were consistently used to murder more people than rifles alone.

FBI homicide data 2005-2011, ranked in order of weapons used most often in 2011: 


 Our ruling

Like an older Facebook item, Abbott’s tweet uses data selectively, ignoring the significant role of handguns in gun violence. That said, it is correct that FBI data indicates that in 2011, more people were killed with ""clubs and hammers"" than with any type of rifle",True,"January 30, 2013"
"""Today, about 40 percent of guns are purchased without a background check.""","
Gun control advocates are lining up behind President Barack Obama’s call for a law requiring universal background checks on gun purchases.

""The background checks bill is vitally important,"" New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand said in an interview on MSNBC Jan. 24, 2013. It’s ""going to basically say you can’t buy guns without getting a background check. Today, about 40 percent of guns are purchased without a background check.""

If the figure sounds familiar, it’s because gun control advocates are citing it with abandon. Obama mentioned it in the White House ceremony outlining his slate of new gun restrictions. A white paper by researchers at Johns Hopkins University asserts it without qualification. Indeed, it’s a powerful claim: that 40 percent of guns are bought and sold in America with no paper trail, no fingerprint of the hands they fall into. Gillibrand is right that federal law does not require background checks on all gun purchases, contrary to what polls show most Americans support.

It’s the 40-percent figure that’s the sticking point.

We have examined this claim before at PolitiFact, when New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg said in July 2012, ""There's a loophole where you can sell guns without a background check … 40 percent of guns are sold that way"" at gun shows and over the Internet. At the time we rated the claim Mostly True.   But since the Newtown, Conn., school shooting, we’ve heard the statistic repeated again and again, plus seen criticism of its use. So we’ve decided to take another look. We have since re-rated the Bloomberg fact-check to Half True.

The 1997 study

The original source of the 40 percent figure is a 1997 National Institute of Justice study by researchers Philip Cook of Duke University and Jens Ludwig of the University of Chicago, who examined data from a 1994 telephone survey about gun ownership. The survey, which sampled 2,568 homes, asked owners an array of questions, including how many guns were in the house, what they were used for, how they were stored and how they were obtained.

But it’s important to note that of the 2,568 households surveyed, only 251 people answered the question about the origin of their gun.

But in those answers, Cook and Ludwig found that 35.7 percent of respondents reported obtaining their gun from somewhere other than a licensed dealer. (That has been rounded up to 40 percent.) Some people answered ""probably"" and ""probably not"" if they weren’t entirely sure whether the seller was a licensed dealer. In some cases, where the respondent skipped the question about whether the gun came from a licensed dealer, the researchers made a judgment call. Ludwig said in an email that they mined answers to other questions (such as whether the gun was a gift) to guide them.

""Our approach ... was to be conservative in estimating what fraction of sales are in the primary market,"" Ludwig wrote. ""Primary market"" refers to guns sold by dealers in retail stores or pawn shops. The ""secondary market"" includes gun shows and other transactions where a background check is not required.

Some critics find fault with the 40 percent figure because it includes guns that are inherited or won -- in other words, transactions that could reasonably be assumed not to involve a background check.

The NRA, arguably the loudest voice of opposition to tighter gun controls, referenced the study in a recent blog post. The group does not dispute the method or findings of the study but says the 40 percent claim is a misinterpretation by gun control advocates.

We’re confident that the study, conducted by respected researchers using the best available evidence, was reliable in its time. What’s less clear: how reliable it remains today.

‘I have no idea’

We asked Cook, the other study author, what he thought about the 40 percent figure being referenced so frequently since gun control lurched back to the forefront of the national debate.

""I’ve been amazed at how much interest there’s been in it. It’s been lying there dormant for 20 years,"" he said.

So is it still a current, reliable estimate of secondary market gun sales?

""The answer is I have no idea,"" Cook said. ""This survey was done almost 20 years ago. … It’s clear there are a lot of transactions that are not through dealers. How many, we’re not really clear on it. … We would say it’s a very old number.""

Other scholars had similar views.

""I don’t see how anyone could know that number,"" said James Jacobs, Center for Research in Crime and Justice at New York University School of Law.

Paul Blackman is a retired criminologist and former research coordinator for the NRA Institute for Legislative Action. ""Personally, I think your safest bet is to say that no one knows, but that the vast majority of crime guns come from some other source than gun shows,"" he told us.

One expert, David Kopel at the University of Denver law school, said he doesn’t think the figure was ever accurate because of what the survey actually asked.

""The study did not say whether there was a background check on the sale. It asked the buyer, do you think there was? So some buyers may have known, some may not have known,"" Kopel said. ""All it measured was buyer perception, not whether a check actually occurred.""

A stable market

We looked but couldn’t find any more recent studies like Cook’s and Ludwig’s. Some gun control advocates blame a federal freeze on funding gun research for the lack of new data. But even absent that, some experts argue that little has changed about the gun market in the decades since the study was conducted.

""It’s a fairly stable market. That is to say, gun stores have had their part, police supply stores have had their part, and then there are the gun shows and private dealings about which we know very little,"" said Robert McCrie, of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. ""To be sure, there has been this bump up in gun purchases, which we know from reports from gun stores and the companies like Smith & Wesson. There’s the knowledge that the market has been more vigorous and probably that higher vigor has been reflected in gun shows and private sales in tandem.""

His take: ""The 40 percent seems about right.""

Jay Corzine has attended and studies gun shows in Florida. The University of Central Florida professor says that based on his observation, no more than 15 to 20 percent of sales at gun shows happen without a background check. But when you add in other private sales -- neighbors selling to neighbors, ads in the paper, etc. -- the 40 percent figure is ""probably accurate"" and ""a very good figure to use.""

Gary Kleck, whose research has provided the foundation for less restrictive concealed carry laws, agrees that conditions in the gun market haven’t changed much.

""I know of no affirmative reason to think that the methods of acquiring guns has significantly changed in recent decades, or that conditions have changed such that private (non-dealer) transfers have become more (or less) important. The laws regulating gun sales have not gotten significantly more (or less) strict since the 1994 Brady Act, so there's no strong basis for expecting fewer dealer sales or more non-dealer sales as a result of legal changes,"" Kleck, a professor at Florida State University, wrote in an email.

Kleck says the 40 percent estimate is ""probably still reasonably valid today."" But he further argues that this fact shouldn’t guide new policy, because the problem is not how legal, background-checked purchasers are obtaining guns, but how criminals are.

Our ruling

Gillibrand claimed that ""today, about 40 percent of guns are purchased without a background check.""

She, and other gun control advocates who have cited that figure, correctly repeated the findings of a well-respected study about gun ownership. There’s no question that many guns are bought and sold in America without the oversight of a background check.

But is 40 percent true ""today,"" as Gillibrand said? Even the author of the original study says nobody knows. By mentioning the statistic as if it is current and accurate, Gillibrand revealed nothing of the fact that the figure is almost 20 years old. That’s an essential detail that people engaged in the gun debate should know",Half True,"January 30, 2013"
"""One out of every five law enforcement officers that's killed is killed with an assault weapon.""","Almost six weeks after the gun rampage at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., took the lead in proposing a new assault weapons ban. She later argued for its passage on the Jan. 28, 2013, edition of CBS’ Face the Nation.

Host Bob Schieffer asked Feinstein, ""What about the idea -- which some gun rights supporters cite -- they say, ‘Look, all of this is just to make people feel good. It's just, kind of, feel-good legislation’ -- that, in the end, it's not going to stop these kinds of incidents?""

Feinstein responded in part, ""Well, that's absolutely not true. What we are trying to do is overall see that weapons ... are in the hands of responsible citizens, that they are used legally, not illegally, that they do not fall into the hands of gangs. Do you realize we have 150,000-plus gang members in this nation? When they go up against the police, it's generally an AK-47. You realize that police have had to break into gun stores to get weapons that would be stronger than the adversary they had? Do you realize that one out of every five law enforcement officers that's killed is killed with an assault weapon?""

A reader asked us whether it was true that ""one out of every five law enforcement officers that's killed is killed with an assault weapon."" So we looked into it. Because Feinstein was talking about gun policy, we will only look at the police officers killed by guns, which in any case accounted for 92 percent of law-enforcement deaths as a result of criminal action between 2002 and 2011, according to FBI data.

When we checked with Feinstein’s office, a spokesman pointed us to a data from the Violence Policy Center, a ""national educational organization working to stop gun death and injury"" and a group that generally favors tighter gun regulations.

This data, obtained from FBI records, showed that eight of the 45 gun-related killings of law-enforcement officers in 2009 were committed with assault weapons. That works out to be almost 18 percent -- quite close to the one in five Feinstein cited.

And this wasn’t a fluke. Calculations published in 2003 by the center showed that during the years 1998 through 2001, at least 41 of the 211 law enforcement officers killed by guns were killed by assault weapons -- 19.4 percent.

We should make an important point, however: There is significant disagreement over what is, or should be, considered ""an assault weapon."" Not all rifles are assault weapons, and not all assault weapons are rifles. For instance, in California -- Feinstein’s home state -- the law includes some types of handguns and shotguns in its definition of ""assault weapon."" But different state laws have different definitions.

For the data it analyzed, the Violence Policy Center went beyond the basic statistics collected by the FBI, which is published in an annual report called ""Law Enforcement Officers Killed and Assaulted."" The FBI breaks the felonious killings of officers into those committed by handguns, rifles and shotguns (as well as by weapons other than guns). The FBI does not include a specific category for ""assault weapons.""

For the two periods studied, the Violence Policy Center obtained additional information from the FBI about every incident in which an officer was killed, including the gun’s make and model. The Violence Policy Center has filed Freedom of Information Act requests for more recent data, but has not yet received the information yet, the Feinstein spokesman said.

We showed the data to Mark E. Safarik, executive director of Forensic Behavioral Services Inc. and a former member of the FBI Behavioral Analysis Unit, to get an independent perspective on whether the Violence Policy Center’s classifications of weapons was reasonable. Safarik told PolitiFact that it’s reasonable to call at least seven of the weapons in the 2009 data ""assault weapons."" In the case of the eighth weapon -- a semiautomatic, .223 caliber rifle of unknown make and model -- he said it’s unclear whether it would qualify as an assault weapon.

Dropping the number of assault weapons from eight to seven would make the percentage about 16 percent -- still not too far off from one in five.

Still, Safarik and others urged caution, emphasizing that ""assault weapon"" can be molded to the purposes of whoever is using the term.

""Whatever any politician wants to define as an assault weapon, that is the way it goes,"" said Vance McLaughlin, a criminal justice professor at Jacksonville State University in Alabama. ""If I define an assault weapon as any semi-auto that has 11 or more cartridges in its magazine, I can then poach some numbers from the handgun category. And on and on and on.""

Our ruling

Because the definition of ""assault weapon"" is subject to debate, the categorization of any given weapon is open to some interpretation. Still, while the numbers were analyzed by a group with a stake in the fight, we find the data reasonable. The data has been consistent in the five years studied, and at worst, Feinstein's figure for the most recent year, 2009, is only a few percentage points high",Mostly True,"January 29, 2013"
"""Washington, D.C., had some of the strictest gun laws in the country. And when they passed them, violence skyrocketed.""","
Do gun laws work?

As lawmakers consider President Barack Obama's call to take action against gun violence after mass shootings in Connecticut, Colorado, Wisconsin and Arizona, some argue new rules won’t help.

Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, told Fox News that Obama’s plan — which proposes steps such as closing background check loopholes and banning military-style assault weapons and high-capacity magazines — is ""not going to solve the problem.""

""Washington, D.C. had some of the strictest gun laws in the country,"" Rubio told host Brian Kilmeade on Jan. 17, 2013. ""And when they passed them, violence skyrocketed.""

We wanted to know: Did violence leap after the nation’s capital cracked down on guns?

 Unprotected citizens

In 1976, the District of Columbia required all guns to be registered, banned new handguns and required guns at home to be stored unloaded and disassembled or locked up.

The law’s handgun ban was invalidated by federal courts in 2007, a decision reaffirmed by the Supreme Court in 2008. But for three decades, the nation’s capital had some of the most restrictive gun laws in the country.

We’ll note that the president isn’t proposing D.C.’s gun laws — indeed, the Supreme Court took that off the table — so it’s a comparison of questionable value. But we were curious whether Rubio was correct to say that Washington’s handgun ban was followed by violence.

Why would violence climb after such a ban? Rubio’s office declined to explain, but a Jan. 15, 2013, opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal by journalist and attorney Jeffrey Scott Shapiro makes a similar argument: 
Shapiro’s homicide numbers match the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting statistics. But when we looked at related data, it was quickly apparent he chose statistics that told a simple story — pass ban, violent crime soars — that was in reality much more complicated.

We reached out to Shapiro to ask for research to support his conclusion, but didn’t hear back.

Violent crime rates in the District of Columbia from 1976 look like a rockin’ roller coaster, dipping slightly after the ban’s passage, climbing steadily until the early ‘80s, diving again through the late ‘80s, then climbing a steep mountain until the early ‘90s.

Then violent crime, as in the rest of the country, fell steeply, settling into a slower cruise downward since the start of the new century.

(It’s still much more violent in the District than the rest of the nation, with 1,330 violent crimes per 100,000 people compared with 363 per 100,000 for the entire country in 2010.)

But Shapiro cited the annual homicide number for 1993 — the height of violent crime in the four decades we’re examining — then later says: 
He fails to mention that drop started in 1994.

 Weapon-choice theory

But back to Rubio. In his Fox News interview, he didn’t claim the gun ban caused the crime rate to rise. But he does say that the gun laws are ""not going to solve the problem,"" citing D.C.’s experience as an example.

We know that violent crime didn’t simply ""skyrocket"" in the District after the handgun ban passed in 1976. It took a rocky path with peaks in 1981 and 1993, and has generally fallen since then.

A similar trend echoed across the United States. That suggests a wide range of factors at work, not merely D.C.’s gun laws.

Some experts who study violence, such as Alfred Blumstein of Carnegie Mellon University, say the early ‘80s peak and fall can largely be attributed to the baby boomer generation entering their teens and 20s and then growing up. (People tend to be more law abiding as they age.) The later U.S. peak, Blumstein said, came with crack cocaine and President Ronald Reagan’s war on drugs.

And the fall in violent crime since then? Theories include the passage of Roe vs. Wade and a reduction in environmental lead. Blumstein argues an important part of the explanation was the decline in the demand for crack as people saw its effects in older friends and relatives, ""and aggressive actions by police in taking the guns off the street.""

Ah, so, back to gun laws. What, if any, role did they play in violent crime in the District of Columbia?

There’s not a lot of fresh research on the subject, since Congress put a chill on government-funded firearms research starting in the late ‘90s. (Something that the president’s recent executive actions seek to reverse.)

But Garen Wintemute, director of the Violence Prevention Research Program at the University of California at Davis School of Medicine, pointed us to a 1991 study in the New England Journal of Medicine.

""Sen. Rubio couldn't be more wrong,"" he told PolitiFact.

The study, conducted by a research group at the University of Maryland and University at Albany, examined suicides and homicides in the District of Columbia compared with nearby cities from 1968 to 1987. They found that the adoption of the gun-licensing law ""coincided with an abrupt decline"" in gun-related deaths not found just across the border. Nor were there increases in homicides or suicides that didn’t use guns.

""Our data suggest that restrictions on access to guns in the District of Columbia prevented an average of 47 deaths each year after the law was implemented,"" the authors concluded.

Despite widely circulated Internet criticism to the contrary, researchers did consider the effects of population changes, including age and population size. They got similar results.

How did the laws help? The researchers argued the data supported something called the weapon-choice theory. When people don’t have easy access to guns, some will use a less deadly form of force. So even if the number of assaults and suicide attempts stays the same, with fewer guns, deaths drop.

The researchers argued their results showed it was reasonable to assume that even with violent crime rising, restrictions on gun access had ""a preventive effect.""

In other words, even if ""violence skyrocketed,"" as Rubio said, that’s not direct evidence that D.C.’s gun laws failed to help. Of course, they also didn’t fully ""solve the problem.""

Our ruling

Rubio, expressing his disappointment in Obama’s recent actions to prevent gun violence, argued they wouldn’t solve the problem. ""Washington, D.C. had some of the strictest gun laws in the country,"" he said. ""And when they passed them, violence skyrocketed.""

Crime statistics don’t support Rubio’s simple story. Rather than skyrocket, violent crime rose and fell, rose and fell. Other social and demographic factors played a larger role than gun laws. And one peer-reviewed study about gun laws’ role in violent crime through 1987 showed they reduced homicides and suicides.

Rubio’s statement is partially accurate — in some years, violent crime in the District of Columbia did rise even with a handgun ban in place — but leaves out important details and context",Half True,"January 28, 2013"
"""We just had someone last week in Neenah near a school kill someone with a bow and arrow.""","
Questions about gun control were on the mind of reporters when Gov. Scott Walker held a news conference in Madison on Jan. 10, 2013.

Reporters, including one from the Wall Street Journal, asked the first-term governor about the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, where 20 children and six adults were killed in December 2012 by a man with a semi-automatic weapon.

Did the carnage affect Walker’s stance on gun control?

The governor responded that a variety of factors, including the mental health of the perpetrator, need to be considered to prevent future tragic events such as Sandy Hook and the August 2012 shooting at the Sikh temple in Oak Creek.

Walker said too much attention is paid to the weapon in such shootings and cited a recent case as an example: ""We just had someone last week in Neenah near a school kill someone with a bow and arrow.""

He added that if gun control efforts are  ""just focused on the weapon, that gets away from the question of who are the people committing these heinous acts and what is it that’s happening that we’re not able to prevent them from doing that.""

Walker has enjoyed considerable support from the National Rifle Association, and the group has given him an A-plus rating. His response to the gun control question was in line with groups fighting restrictions on guns: Don’t blame the weapons.

There was only one problem with Walker’s statement about the bow and arrow murder.

It never happened.

We asked Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie to explain the governor’s comment the day after he spoke. He responded three days later with this emailed statement:

""The Governor misspoke when he said someone was killed. I believe he was referring the recent standoff that involved a bow and arrow.""

Winnebago County Sheriff’s Department Capt. David Mack provided the details, starting with the most important one: ""No one got killed. I know because I was there.""

In fact there were no serious injuries in the Jan. 3, 2013, domestic dispute in the Town of Clayton, located just west of Neenah.

According to Mack:

Authorities were called at 9:16 a.m. to a home after receiving reports of a disturbance between Shawn Coenen, 21, and his father.

During the dispute outside the house, ""the son shot an arrow at the father, but the arrow did not strike the father,"" Mack said. Instead, it hit a vehicle.

Coenen was inside the house when authorities arrived. Initially, police weren’t certain that he was inside, so, as a precaution, they sent several officers to Clayton Elementary School, which is 2.5 miles away.

""The school was in session, and they were advised about the situation and placed in lockdown,"" Mack said.

Authorities determined that Coenen was in the house and were told by family members that there were a dozen firearms inside, but that the guns were locked in a gun cabinet. The SWAT team and crisis negotiators were called, and Coenen was arrested without incident at 1:22 p.m., Mack said.

Coenen faces three felony charges -- second degree reckless endangerment, failure to comply with an officer, and being a felon in possession of a firearm.

Our rating

Reporters asked Walker about his views of gun control in the wake Sandy Hook school shooting. Walker responded by discussing a homicide involving a bow and arrow near a Neenah school.

Trouble was, there wasn’t such a homicide. What’s more, while the incident was near a school (2.5 miles away) it didn’t have anything to do with the school. And the SWAT team was called because the suspect was holed up inside the house -- with potential access to guns.

Finally, Walker’s staff allowed his statement to go uncorrected for four days and only admitted that it was incorrect after being asked about it by PolitiFact",False Pants on Fire,"January 28, 2013"
"People committed involuntarily for 72 hours under the Baker Act will get their guns back ""automatically and immediately upon discharge....and their commitment is never entered into a background check database.""","
Following the shooting at the Sandy Hook elementary school in Newtown, Conn., Sunrise Mayor Mike Ryan has become one of the leading advocates in Broward County for changing laws to improve school safety.

Ryan, a member of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, called for several measures, including the need to address mental health and guns, in the political blog BrowardBeat.com.

""Now someone committed involuntarily for 72 hours under the ‘Baker Act’ (as a danger to themselves or others) will have their guns returned to them by the police automatically and immediately upon discharge after 72 hours AND their commitment is never entered into a background check database,"" said Ryan, in a guest column on Jan. 14. ""As a result, there is also no impediment or second thought given to someone being released and purchasing a gun.""  

Ryan’s claim suggests that it’s a cinch for someone ""committed"" for up to three days under the Baker Act to reclaim their guns, and that they stay off any list that would ban them from getting a new one. We wanted to check to see if Ryan was correct.

What is the Baker Act?

Under the Baker Act, law enforcement can take someone against their will to a facility for a mental health evaluation if the person is a danger to themselves or others.

A person can’t be held involuntarily for longer than 72 hours, but a medical expert needs to examine the person and sign off on his or her release.

We should point out that the simple act of being held under the Baker Act doesn’t mean the person is mentally ill or in need of commitment. In 2010, less than 1 percent of about 140,000 involuntary examinations led to involuntary placement in a mental health treatment facility, according to the Florida Department of Children and Families. This number doesn’t account for people who voluntarily remained in facilities.

The Baker Act doesn’t state whether guns should be taken or returned, except to ban guns from hospitals providing mental health services. So law enforcement can take their guns when they are transported to a facility under the Baker Act.

We couldn’t find data regarding how often someone who is Baker Acted has their firearm taken. ""Most individuals don’t have weapons at the time of the Baker Act,"" said Miami-Dade County Judge Steve Leifman, who chairs judicial committees on mental health.

But interviews with attorneys, law enforcement officers and experts on the Baker Act revealed, it does happen. We consistently heard from law enforcement that whether they take the gun for safekeeping depends on the specific case.

For example, if a wife calls police to report that her husband is despondent and has a gun, and he is Baker Acted at home, police would take the gun, said Hillsborough Sheriff Col. Jim Previtera. But if someone is Baker Acted on the street and didn’t have a gun on him, the sheriff’s office wouldn’t go to his home and seize the gun.

Under the Baker Act, people who haven’t committed crimes are not supposed to be treated as criminals and they do retain their constitutional rights -- including the right to own a gun.

So do they get their guns back?

A 2009 Florida Attorney General opinion specifically states that law-abiding people who are released under the Baker Act should get their guns back.

""In the absence of an arrest and criminal charge against the person sent for evaluation under Florida's Baker Act, (law enforcement) may not retain firearms confiscated from such persons and retained by that office,"" concluded then Attorney General Bill McCollum.

The opinion didn’t outline procedures for gun retrieval. That means ""there is absolutely no consistency around the state in how this is being practiced,"" according to former state Baker Act director Martha Lenderman, who now trains law enforcement.

 How do police deal with firearms and Baker Act?

We contacted a few law enforcement agencies and other experts about how the gun retrieval is handled.

""You are supposed to get your gun back automatically, but rarely does that happen because they are in the hands of the police department,"" said Jon Gutmacher, an Orlando defense attorney and former Broward prosecutor who specializes in firearm cases.

In Ryan’s city of Sunrise, the police department doesn’t have a written policy on returning guns after a Baker Act. There have been multiple cases where the department required a court order, Deputy Chief Gerald Eddy told PolitiFact Florida.

But there have been times when gun owners tell Sunrise police that the law doesn’t require a court order and threaten litigation. In such cases, the department has to decide whether to still require the court order.

(Ryan told us that he has directed city officials to write a policy to require a court order in all cases ""while we advocate for the law to be changed to relieve us of the obligation to return guns to those Baker Acted."")

We found many law enforcement agencies -- including the sheriff’s offices in Broward and Hillsborough and police departments in the cities of Fort Lauderdale, Hollywood and nearby town of Davie -- do require a court order.

Miami-Dade requires a court order if the person used the gun to breach the peace but not if the medically cleared person didn’t use it to breach the peace, Det. Javier Baez said.

In Broward, gun owners must fill out paperwork and pay a filing fee that generally ranges between $55 and $300 depending on the cost of their gun. It usually takes 30 to 45 days to get a hearing. If the law enforcement agency doesn’t object, then a mediator signs off and the judge grants the order. Donna Johnson, manager of county civil court, estimated Broward has about six to 10 such hearings a year.  

In Hillsborough, which doesn’t charge the gun owners a fee, the judge may ask the person to describe what happened that led to the Baker Act evaluation and some other questions, said Jason Gordillo, Hillsborough sheriff’s office legal counsel who has handled such cases for 10 years.

The judge looks for any legal grounds that would ban the person from getting their gun back -- for example a convicted felon or someone with a domestic violence injunction. Usually after a brief hearing the judge issues the order to return the gun.

""They can pick it up that day if they want,"" Gordillo said. The same procedures are used in cases that involved other law enforcement agencies within Hillsborough, he said.

The Pasco County Sheriff's Office doesn’t have a written policy but handles these matters on a case-by-case basis, spokesman Kevin Doll said. He said the usual requirements for return of a gun include Baker Act hospital discharge records, a letter from a licensed mental health professional stating the person is of sound mind and he is of no harm if the firearm is returned to him, and proof of ownership.  

""We cannot compel a person to provide their medical records (HIPAA rules), but if they want their weapons back without a court order, they must provide the requested documents,"" Doll told PolitiFact in an email.

Pinellas County Sheriff’s Office handles such matters on a case-by-case basis and does not have a written policy.

""We often have told them to get a court order to retrieve the weapon, but again, technically nothing in the law allows us to require a court order,"" Sgt. David DiSano said.

When a Baker Act leads to a commitment

Ryan’s claim related to when someone is released after a Baker Act evaluation after 72 hours  -- and therefore isn’t committed (even though he used the word committed). But we also  wondered if someone can get their gun back if they are committed for longer treatment.

Individuals who had been committed may petition the court to restore their gun rights and the court must rule in their favor if it determines the person is not a threat to public safety. (The state attorney can object.)

Baker Act and background checks

Before ringing up a gun sale, federal firearms licensees must contact the FBI or other designated agency to check National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS, to see if the person is banned from having a gun. (Read about the gaps in this reporting system here.) Since an evaluation under the Baker Act does not equal commitment, it is not entered into the FBI’s database.

Any person who has been ""adjudicated as a mental defective"" or ""committed to a mental institution"" is prohibited under federal law from possessing any firearm. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement also maintains a similar database based on court records.

Some people who have a Baker Act evaluation do have mental illness, but they also can stabilize and remain functional throughout their lives, said Lenderman. She said the state needs more clear public policy on when to take -- and when to give back -- guns taken in Baker Act cases.

""Simply having a diagnosis of a medical disorder, which it is, should not deprive you of constitutional rights unless certain criteria have been met,"" she said. ""The law only says if you have a commitment of a court for involuntary placement is that going to take place. ... I hate to see further stigmatization of people with mental illness as though they are all dangerous people -- that is just flat out not true.""

Blanket policies that attempt to stop people with mental illness from obtaining guns can be both overinclusive and underinclusive, said Ron Honberg, a director at the National Alliance on Mental Illness. The key is identifying people who are violent -- not simply those who have a mental illness.

Some of the shooters in recent mass shootings were unknown to the mental health system and therefore wouldn’t have been on such a banned list anyway, he said.

""I understand the knee-jerk let’s keep guns out of the hands of all people with mental illness (but) it's pretty complicated.""

We asked Ryan how he thinks Florida law should handle people who have had a Baker Act evaluation and access to guns.

""The law should require that someone who has been Baker Acted to prove by some standard they are mentally fit to have their guns returned and in the interim be prohibited from purchasing weapons,"" he wrote in an email.  

We asked Ryan to explain why he wrote that the guns are returned ""automatically and immediately upon discharge"" if many cities actually require a court order.

""If the AG opinion is read that such ‘property’ can not be withheld, then the return would be automatic … that is, without restriction.  Immediacy would be without the delay of court hearings or evaluation by mental professionals and upon request.  There would be no reason for delay.   They can walk out of the institution, go to the police department and request return immediately,"" he wrote.  ""That is the import of the AG's opinion.""

Our ruling

Ryan made a two-part claim about the Baker Act and guns. First, he said ""Now someone committed involuntarily for 72 hours under the ‘Baker Act’ (as a danger to themselves or others) will have their guns returned to them by the police automatically and immediately upon discharge after 72 hours...""  

Those who are released after a Baker Act evaluation are entitled to get their guns back, the state’s former attorney general wrote in an opinion. Many law enforcement agencies require a court order, a process than can take several weeks.

The second part of Ryan’s claim, ""and their commitment is never entered into a background check database,"" is close to correct. It would be more accurate to say that ""their evaluation under the Baker Act is never entered into a background check database."" An evaluation itself is not commitment, and therefore the law stating that a commitment would preclude someone from having a weapon doesn’t apply",Half True,"January 25, 2013"
"""Even members of the NRA, when they were polled recently, were under the impression that everyone has a criminal background check.""","
On the president’s list of gun-control priorities: require background checks for all gun sales.

That step has widespread support, even among gun owners, gun-control advocates say.

In fact, many assume such a measure is already in place, claimed Rep. Jackie Speier, a California Democrat who is vice chair of a new congressional Gun Violence Prevention Task Force.

""Even members of the NRA, when they were polled recently, were under the impression that everyone has a criminal background check,"" she told Ed Schultz in a Jan. 15, 2013, appearance on MSNBC’s The Ed Show.

We wondered: Is that true?

We asked Speier’s office to point us to the poll.

 Mayors Against Illegal Guns

Speier’s communications director, Jenny Werwa, told us the lawmaker based her comment on a July 2012 poll commissioned by Mayors Against Illegal Guns.

As its name suggests, the group includes city mayors concerned with illegal guns and gun violence and is helmed by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, an independent, and Boston Mayor Thomas Menino, a Democrat.

The group hired Republican pollster Frank Luntz. His organization, Luntz Global, polled 945 gun owners nationwide in May 2012, half of whom were gun owners who were ""current or lapsed"" members of the National Rifle Association and half of whom were non-NRA gun owners.

The poll showed that ""gun owners’ knowledge of existing laws is tenuous,"" Luntz Global’s report says. ""Over half (53 percent ) of non-NRA members and 57 percent of NRA members believe the statement, ‘Everyone who wants to buy a gun has to pass a background check to complete the purchase’ is true.""

The reality is that background checks are required in sales by federally licensed gun dealers, but not for those by private sellers.

The White House wants to require criminal background checks for all gun sales. The National Rifle Association, which supports the current background check requirement, has suggested that an expansion of the law might be a step toward gun confiscation.

 What the NRA says

We contacted NRA spokesmen to ask for their evaluation of Speier’s claim, but they didn’t respond.

We found an NRA response, however, to a similar poll by Mayors Against Illegal Guns conducted by Frank Luntz in 2009.

The Web post calls Bloomberg an ""anti-gun politician-activist,"" and attacks Luntz, a widely quoted communications consultant for Republican politicians and Fortune 100 companies, with decade-old criticism from two polling organizations. 
In other words, the NRA attacked the source of the previous poll, not the results.

We looked for other polls to see if they exposed weakness in the poll’s conclusions.

We didn’t immediately find a survey that addressed gun owners’ knowledge of existing laws. But the Luntz poll also asked about support for ""requiring a criminal background check of anyone purchasing a gun."" The poll found that 82 percent of gun owners were in favor of required background checks, including 74 percent of NRA members.

Recent independent polls show similar numbers. A Pew Research Center poll from Jan. 9-13, 2013, of 1,502 adults found 85 percent of gun owners favor making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks — nearly identical to the Luntz poll. A CBS/New York Times poll conducted Jan. 11-15 among 1,110 adults showed that 85 percent of respondents living in a household with an NRA member support universal background checks.

 Our ruling

Rep. Jackie Speier said, ""even members of the NRA, when they were polled recently, were under the impression that everyone has a criminal background check.""

She relied on a poll conducted last summer by an interest group that broke out results for ""current or lapsed"" NRA members. It showed a majority of those NRA gun owners believe ""everyone who wants to buy a gun has to pass a background check."" While we didn’t find recent polls asking a similar question, we did find other polls showing that NRA members support background checks for all, including private purchases and purchases at gun shows.

It should be clarified that the Luntz poll results were for current and former NRA members",Mostly True,"January 23, 2013"
"Since 1968, ""more Americans have died from gunfire than died in … all the wars of this country's history.""","Since the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., supporters and opponents of gun control have thrown out statistics to support their point of view.

Here’s one that caught our eye, offered by liberal commentator Mark Shields on the Dec. 21, 2012, edition of the PBS NewsHour.

Shields told host Judy Woodruff, ""You know, Judy, the reality is -- and it's a terrible reality -- since Robert Kennedy died in the Ambassador Hotel on June 4, 1968, more Americans have died from gunfire than died in … all the wars of this country's history, from the Revolutionary through the Civil War, World War I, World War II, in those 43 years. ... I mean, guns are a problem. And I think they still have to be confronted.""

Is the death toll that high? Let's examine each half of his comparison.

Deaths from warfare

We found a comprehensive study of war-related deaths published by the Congressional Research Service on Feb. 26, 2010, and we supplemented that with data for deaths in Iraq and Afghanistan using the website icasualties.org. Where possible, we’ve used the broadest definition of ""death"" -- that is, all war-related deaths, not just those that occurred in combat.

Here’s a summary of deaths by major conflict:   4,435 2,260 13,283 525,000 2,446 116,516 405,399 36,574 58,220 383 2,175 4,486 1,171,177 
Another 362 deaths resulted from other conflicts since 1980, such as interventions in Lebanon, Grenada, Panama, Somalia and Haiti, but the number is not large enough to make a difference.

Gunfire deaths

The number of deaths from gunfire is a bit more complicated to total. Two Internet-accessible data sets from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention allow us to pin down the number of deaths from 1981 to 1998 and from 1999 to 2010. We’ve added FBI figures for 2011, and we offer a number for 1968 to 1980 using a conservative estimate of data we found in a graph in this 1994 paper published by the CDC.

Here is a summary. The figures below refer to total deaths caused by firearms:
  
We should note that these figures refer to all gun-fire related deaths -- not just homicides, but also suicides and accidental deaths. In 2011, about one-quarter of firearm-related deaths were homicides, according to FBI and CDC data. Using total firearm-related deaths makes the case against guns more dramatic than just using homicides alone",Mostly True,"January 18, 2013"
"In 2011, more people were murdered with knives, ""hands or feet"" or ""clubs and hammers"" than with any type of rifle.","
Gun-rights advocates have mounted an aggressive social-media campaign to blunt the popularity of the White House’s efforts to advance new restrictions on guns.

One reader forwarded us a statistics-heavy Facebook post that echoes others we’ve received. It says, ""Facts gun control advocates don’t want you to know. According to the FBI, in 2011, 1,694 were murdered with knives, 726 with hands or feet, 496 with clubs or hammers, 323 with rifles of any type. But Obama wants to ban semi-automatic rifles?""

We should first note that there is significant disagreement over what is, or should be, considered ""an assault weapon."" For instance, even though the Facebook post references Obama’s intention to ""ban semi-automatic rifles,"" California law already includes some types of handguns and shotguns in its definition of ""assault weapon.""

That said, we’ll take a look at the number of deaths caused by rifles. To check the post, we looked at the 2011 edition of the FBI’s annual ""Crime in the United States"" report. The report breaks down the types of weapons used in murder. These are the statistics for 2011, the most recent year available: 
  
6,220 
323 
356 
97 
1,587 
1,694 
496 
728 

The Facebook post and the FBI stats are closely in tune. Except for a minor typo in the Facebook post’s number for deaths by hands, fists or feet, the numbers are accurate.

The number cited for rifles was somewhat less precise. While it’s true that the FBI counted 323 murders by rifles, the agency also counted 1,587 murders by an undetermined type of firearm and 97 by ""other guns."" If gun usage in these two categories followed the same pattern as other gun homicides, that would add another 75 or so murders by rifle, making an estimate for the number of rifle murders about 400, rather than 323.

Still, the larger point holds: Murders by knives, blunt objects and body parts each individually outweighed those committed using a rifle.

We should note that while the Facebook post’s comparison is accurate as far as it goes, it does ignore the single biggest category of weapons used in murders -- handguns. Handguns were used in 6,220 cases, or 72 percent of all firearm murders in 2011 and slightly under half of all murders using any kind of weapon that year.

This caveat illustrates how the selection and framing of statistics can be used to bolster one side or the other in the gun debate.

Our ruling

The post uses data selectively, ignoring the significant role of handguns in gun violence. But the statistics it mentions are solid. FBI data backs up the Facebook post’s claim that in 2011, more people were murdered with knives, ""hands or feet"" or ""clubs and hammers"" than with any type of rifle",True,"January 18, 2013"
"In 2010, 2,694 young people were killed by gunfire. 1,773 were victims of homicide; 67 were elementary school-age children.","
Five days after shootings in Newtown, Conn., left 28 people dead -- including 20 children at Sandy Hook Elementary -- leaders at two of Georgia’s higher education institutions weighed in on the gun safety debate.

Leaders of Oglethorpe University and Agnes Scott College  -- both are in DeKalb County -- released an open letter pushing for stricter gun safety legislation. It was initially co-signed by more than 160 other college and university presidents nationwide, including Atlanta’s Morehouse and Spelman colleges and Clark Atlanta University. Oglethorpe President Lawrence M. Schall said he was moved to draft the letter after watching a televised memorial service for Newtown victims.

""For many years now, our nation’s leaders have engaged in fevered debates on higher education, yet lawmakers shy away from taking action on one issue that prevents thousands of young people from living lives of promise, let alone realizing their college dreams. That issue is gun safety,"" the letter reads. "" … In 2010, 2,694 young people were killed by gunfire. 1,773 were victims of homicide; 67 were elementary school-age children. If those children and teens were alive today, they would fill 108 classrooms of 25 each.""

Since the Connecticut shooting, the gun safety debate has come front and center at all levels of government. The White House has rolled out a $500 million gun safety package. State lawmakers are pushing for armed officers in schools. Metro Atlanta school districts have conducted ""active shooter"" lockdown drills for staff and students.

A multitude of statistics has been tossed about by advocates on both sides of the issue to make their points. We wondered if the data used by higher education leaders was accurate. And we were curious how it was compiled.

By the time President Barack Obama unveiled his gun-violence reduction plan this week, the list of higher education co-signers of the gun safety letter had risen to more than 300. The letter has received national attention, with coverage on news outlets including CNN, The Huffington Post, NPR and The Wall Street Journal.

A spokesman for Oglethorpe University said the gun death statistics used in the letter were taken directly from data also used by the Children’s Defense Fund, the Washington, D.C., child-advocacy organization led by Marian Wright Edelman. The data includes figures for children and youths through age 19. In one of her weekly ""Child Watch"" columns last month, Edelman used the same statistics to also implore action on gun violence.

The figures cited by the Children’s Defense Fund are actually data compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and available in its WONDER (Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research) online database research system. For its various data, the CDC WONDER system uses information collected from its agency affiliates.

The mortality data used in the gun safety letter is compiled from death certificates issued in each state and recorded by the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics. That information is then included in the WONDER database. Of note are the types of gun deaths included in the numbers cited. The list of 2,694 young people reportedly killed by gunfire includes those who died of suicide, as well as accidental discharge of a firearm and discharge of a firearm with an undetermined intent.

The CDC’s homicide figure varies slightly from the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reports for 2010. The FBI crime statistics are produced from data provided by 17,000 law enforcement agencies across the United States. For children and youths through age 19, 1,402 were victims of homicide (it does not include suicide) by gunfire in 2010, according to the FBI crime report. That is similar to the CDC’s figure of 1,773 homicide victims of the same age during the same year.

The FBI and CDC data sets are the two main sources of these types of statistics, said James Fox, a professor of criminology at Northeastern University in Boston. The CDC numbers can be slightly higher because the FBI figures do not include data from every police department in the country (about 92 percent of the departments submit information to the FBI). But the FBI data, which is published annually, is more up to date, Fox said. The lag time for reporting CDC data is about a year longer.

So, are the numbers of child gun deaths cited in the letter from the college and university presidents accurate?

It depends on who collects, compiles and publishes the data, as well as what is included in the numbers. In the case of the CDC data, it is virtually impossible to track down each death certificate from 2010 to verify the cause of death. Based on an examination of the WONDER data, the numbers appear accurate. It is important to note that the figure for the number of children and youths killed by guns three years ago includes causes such as suicides and unintentional discharges",Mostly True,"January 18, 2013"

It opens with 14 ""Whereas"" statements, beginning with the definition of a semi-automatic firearm as ""a weapon that fires, extracts, ejects and reloads once for each pull and release of the trigger."" (By contrast, fully automatic weapons continue to fire as long as the trigger is being pulled.)

But it was the second statement which caught our attention. It says, ""Semi-automatic weapons, whether pistol or rifle, were designed for use by the military on the battlefield.""

There is no doubt that some of the semi-automatic weapons sold to consumers these days are either very close to those used by soldiers or designed to have the characteristics of military weapons. It's one of their selling points. For example, Bushmaster M4-type carbines are advertised as having a ""distinctive military barrel profile."" The company says its products are used ""by the military of more than 50 countries worldwide.""

But we also know that other weapons, such as many hunting rifles, meet the definition of semi-automatic. So we wondered whether it’s accurate to say that all semi-automatics were really designed for military use.

We contacted the City Council’s majority leader, Seth Yurdin,to see what evidence he had.

He wrote back in an e-mail that, ""Semi-automatic weapons as a class were designed for the battlefield. Why? Semi-automatic weapons are efficient at killing as many people as quickly as possible.""

After listing several different types of weapons used in mass shootings, Yurdin said, ""Yes, there may be particular semi-automatic weapons that have not been designed to win military bids, but the point is that semi-automatic weapons are designed to be efficient killing machines.""

We tried unsuccessfully to contact several manufacturers about the histories of their products, but they did not respond.

But four experts with whom we did speak said the statement in the City Council resolution is wrong because many semi-automatic weapons -- from the very first to those in use today -- were not designed for war.

William Fowler, distinguished professor of history at Northeastern University, in Boston, said semi-automatic weapons ""are not necessarily military. Shotguns, for example, can be gas operated,"" utilizing gas from the discharge of one round to push the next round into the chamber, ready for the trigger to be pulled again.

Going back to the beginning, the first design of a semi-automatic rifle was unveiled in 1885. American gunsmith John Moses Browning crafted the first semi-automatic shotgun in 1902. By 1910, Winchester, Remington and others were making semi-automatic sporting rifles.

When they were first manufactured, ""a lot of time the semis were intended for use by the general public,"" said Frank Hanner, director of the National Infantry Museum in Fort Benning, Ga. ""These were pocket pistols and different things, what we would consider to be a Saturday night special today. A lot of these were intended for protection on the street.""

""The semi-automatic system was NOT specifically developed for the military,"" said Richard Colton, a historian at the Springfield Armory in Massachusetts, who cited the semi-automatic pistols that came out in the 1890s, many of them made in Germany, that were supposed to be for personal use.

David Stieghan, U.S. Army Infantry branch historian at Ft. Benning, said, ""Semi-automatic weapons such as shotguns and .22 caliber hunting rifles had already been in existence for 40 years"" before the U.S. military became the first to adopt them.

""The initial push was to manufacture them for hunting, and home defense and self-defense, because very few in the military cared about them until after World War I,"" he said.

Why didn't the military embrace them earlier?

""They were difficult to machine and manufacture in a way that was inexpensive, and they were not amenable to use in the trenches of World War I,"" said Stieghan. ""With all the mud, dirt, water and everything else, they were just not reliable enough.""

And what about weapons for sale today?

Stieghan said the vast majority of semi-automatic firearms available to the public were never designed for -- nor offered for sale to -- the military.

""There are all sorts of semi-automatic weapons that are unacceptable [to the military] because they're not rugged enough and they don't have the long-range and accuracy that the military would require,"" he said. ""They are designed specifically for consumers.""

Our ruling

The Providence City Council, in a resolution approved earlier this month, asserted: ""Semi-automatic weapons, whether pistol or rifle, were designed for use by the military on the battlefield.""

The military and gun experts we consulted told us that history tells a very different story.

The military did not embrace the weapons until decades after they were developed.

Even today, there are many semi-automatic weapons available to consumers that were not designed for battlefield use.

Why bother with such distinctions? The contentious debate over gun control is consuming the nation. We believe it’s imperative to get the facts right",False,"January 16, 2013"
"""Every day, 34 Americans are murdered with guns.""","
After his father and five other worshippers were killed Aug. 5, 2012, in a mass shooting at the Sikh Temple of Wisconsin, Pardeep Kaleka joined a national campaign to address gun violence.

Kaleka’s father, Satwant Singh Kaleka, died trying to stop gunman Wade Michael Page, who also wounded four other people, including a police officer, before killing himself.

Pardeep Kaleka took part in promoting Demand a Plan, an effort to press President Barack Obama and Congress to develop a plan to counter gun violence.

Kaleka spoke in a one-minute video posted on Demand a Plan’s website on Dec. 17, 2012 -- two months after three people were shot to death at a suburban Milwaukee salon and three days after 26 people were gunned down at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn.

He ended his plea by saying:

""Every day, 34 Americans are murdered with guns. That’s 48,000 Americans murdered with guns during President Obama’s next term. I need to know what our leaders are going to do to stop the gun violence. I demand a plan.""

Let’s check the 34 Americans murdered figure, a statistic repeated by Kaleka’s brother, Amardeep Kaleka, in his own video on the website.

Shootings spurred campaign

The shooting at the Sikh temple, located in the Milwaukee suburb of Oak Creek, is one of at least 62 mass shootings in the U.S. in the past 30 years, according to a December 2012 article in Mother Jones. Most of the killers were mentally ill and obtained their guns legally, the liberal magazine reported.

Demand a Plan was launched in July 2012 after 12 people were shot dead earlier that month at a movie theater in Aurora, Colo. The sponsor of the campaign is Mayors Against Illegal Guns, a national group that includes Oak Creek Mayor Steve Scaffidi and Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett.

The mayors group, headed by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Boston Mayor Thomas Menino, backs legislation that would, among other things, require every gun buyer to pass a criminal background check; and ban military-style weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines.

Similar claim checked

The claim Kaleka makes in his video was also made in December 2012 by Democrat Cory Booker, the mayor of Newark, N.J., on ABC's ""This Week with George Stephanapoulos."" PolitiFact New Jersey rated it Mostly True.

Our colleagues found that, between 2005 and 2009, an average of 34 Americans were killed by guns each day. The figure, which doesn't include suicides or accidents, is from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

But more recent figures from the CDC, which tracks the causes of deaths for U.S. residents, had been released in September 2012. The newer figures show that, for 2006 through 2010, the five-year rolling average for gun homicides dropped to 33.

In 2010 alone, there were 31,672 gun-related deaths, including 19,392 suicides and 11,078 homicides. The remaining deaths were classified as unintentional (606), undetermined (252), or legal intervention/war (344).

PolitiFact New Jersey also pointed out that, on an annual basis, the gun homicide figure is dropping. An average of 30 people were killed in 2010 and the preliminary figure for 2011 is also 30.

That's down from the average of 35 in 2006, the highest year of the decade.

Erika Soto Lamb, a spokeswoman for Demand a Plan, told us the number of gun homicides might be declining because of improvements in medical care have resulted in more lives being saved.

She cited a December 2012 news article in The Wall Street Journal. The article said that the number of people shot in the U.S. is increasing, but the percentage who die is decreasing. The article quoted experts as saying improvement in medical care is a major factor in the decline in gun homicides.

Our rating

As part of a national campaign to address gun violence, Pardeep Kaleka, the son of a Wisconsin gun homicide victim, said: ""Every day, 34 Americans are murdered with guns.""

The average for 2010, the most recent year for which complete figures are available, was 30. But the latest rolling five-year average, the type of measure Kaleka used, was 33, slightly less than what Kaleka claimed",Mostly True,"January 9, 2013"
"""Switzerland (where the government) issues every household a gun . . . has the lowest gun related crime rate of any civilized country in the world!!!""","
Gun control advocates say that fewer guns mean less gun crime. But a Dec. 16 posting on Facebook by a group calling itself the Conservatives Club argues exactly the opposite, and uses the example set by Switzerland to prove its point.

The portion of the post, titled ""A Little Gun History,"" that is in all capital letters caught our attention. It says, ""Switzerland issues every household a gun! Switzerland's government trains every adult they issue a rifle. Switzerland has the lowest gun related crime rate of any civilized country in the world!!! It's a no brainer! Don't let our government waste millions of our tax dollars in an effort to make all law abiding citizens an easy target.""

We thought the assertion that Switzerland ""has the lowest gun related crime rate of any civilized country in the world"" was worth checking out. (We’ll also give you some background about Switzerland's policy on issuing guns.)

(Coincidentally, on Jan. 2, 2013, while we were working on this item, gun policy in Switzerland made the news after a man who started shooting people on the street left three women dead and two men wounded in the Swiss village of Daillon.)

One source of information about guns is GunPolicy.Org, an evidence-based database on firearm safety hosted by the Sydney School of Public Health in Australia and partly co-funded, coincidentally, by the Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs. We ran some comparisons through their database.

We're not going to get into the definition of what makes a ""civilized"" country; instead, we looked at GunPolicy.org’s data on gun homicide rates for 24 countries, mostly in western Europe but also Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the United States.

Switzerland's gun homicide rate was anything but ""the lowest.""

It was fourth highest.

Only Greece, Ireland and the United States had higher rates.

(Switzerland also has the seventh highest suicide rate and the third highest rate of gun-related suicide, according to the GunPolicy.org data. In the latter case, only the United States and Finland had higher rates. Switzerland and Italy were tied for second for the rate of unintentional gun deaths; the United States was number one.)

""Guns kept at home are not necessarily dangerous in the streets, but mostly in situations that happen at home, such as suicide and murder of family members (especially females). In this respect, Switzerland has one of the highest proportions in the Western world,"" said Martin Killias, professor of criminology and criminal law at the University of Zurich Law School.

But homicide isn't the only type of gun crime, and the Facebook posting wasn't specific.

We wanted to know about all crimes involving a gun.

The problem is, ""different countries classify crimes totally differently, which makes it difficult to make a broad statement like that,"" said Philip Alpers, a gun policy researcher at the University of Sydney who runs GunPolicy.org and edits a firearm injury prevention news service.

He said the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime is the best source because the organization classifies crimes in a consistent way. But that organization's website doesn't report data based on gun use, except when homicide is involved.

Nonetheless, we looked at its database on various crime categories such as assault, robbery, and theft, where guns were most likely to be involved, to see whether the crime rate in Switzerland was really that low.

It wasn't.

Eleven out of 26 countries had lower rates of theft than Switzerland.

Thirteen of 26 had lower rates of robbery.

Six of 26 had lower rates of assault.

So the Swiss can't boast the lowest crime rate, another claim gun advocates make.

How much of a role did guns play in such crimes?

The best database on that question was developed by the International Crime Victim Survey, begun in 1987 by a group of European criminologists in an attempt to compare crime rates in 31 countries and 32 major cities.

The ICVS was designed to standardize results and adjust for the fact that the legal definition of a crime can vary from country to country -- as can the willingness to report a crime. The data are based on surveys of victims. The most recent surveys were done in 2004 and 2005.

Once again, when you look at how often guns are used in the commission of a crime, Switzerland doesn't look like the safest place in Europe or other developed countries.

Instead of being at the top of the list among the safest of the 31 countries, Switzerland was tied for 12th when it came to the use of a firearm during a robbery. (The United States ranked 30th. Mexico was last.)

Switzerland was tied for 25th when it came to the risk of seeing a gun if you're the victim of an assault. (The United States was next to the bottom of the list by that measure as well.)

And while only 1 percent of the sexual offenses against women in Switzerland involved a gun, the rate was 0 percent in 22 other countries in the survey. (In the United States, the rate was 5 percent.)

In short, the claim about Switzerland seems completely made up.

One other point is particularly important here. The description of gun distribution in Switzerland omits important information.

The Swiss government doesn't hand out a gun to every household. It requires nearly every able-bodied young male adult to serve in the citizen militia, where they are issued a military rifle. The guns are supposed to be for military use only, not for personal defense.

Those men are supposed to show up for 18 weeks of training, followed by seven re-training sessions (each lasting three weeks) over the next 10 years.

If you want to keep your weapon after your years of service, it is refitted to scale back its firepower and you need to provide a reason for keeping it.

""It's very much like the militia ideal that was embodied in the Second Amendment,"" said Ladd Everett of the Washington, D.C.-based Coalition to Stop Gun Violence. ""Individuals who own military-style firearms are literally serving the national defense of their country.""

The ammunition for the weaponry is kept in a government arsenal. (Swiss men used to be able to keep up to 50 rounds at home and the government did a periodic inventory to make sure it wasn't being used, but that changed in 2007 when the country tightened its rules.)

Ammunition purchased at shooting ranges -- which are very popular in Switzerland -- is supposed to be used there.

Overall, ""they have fewer guns per capita than we do and far stricter gun laws in terms of private ownership,"" Everett said. ""If the U.S. ever attempted to implement gun laws like Switzerland's, the NRA would fight it tooth and nail.""

Our ruling

A Facebook posting, which has been shared more than 187,000 times, said, ""Switzerland has the lowest gun related crime rate of any civilized country in the world.""

But Killias, a Swiss researcher, told us, ""The way Switzerland is being depicted in some [accounts] is absurd.""

To say that the country has the lowest gun related crime rate is not true for homicide, according to the few studies of crime in various countries that includes data on gun use.

It's also not true that Switzerland has the lowest crime rate, whether or not guns are involved.

And survey data show that when a crime such as robbery or assault is committed, the likelihood of a gun being involved is lower in several countries than it is in Switzerland.

In short, this claim appears to be completely fabricated",False Pants on Fire,"January 6, 2013"
Says George Washington said a free people should be armed to guard against government tyranny.,"
Why should ordinary Americans be able to buy semi-automatic weapons designed for the military or law enforcement?

That was ""Fox News Sunday"" host Chris Wallace’s question to U.S. Rep. Louie Gohmert, a Texas Republican, on his Dec. 16, 2012, show, two days after the Newtown, Conn., elementary school massacre.

Gohmert answered in part, ""For the reason George Washington said a free people should be an armed people. It ensures against the tyranny of the government.""

We contacted spokeswomen for Gohmert, seeking details on the Washington quotation, but didn’t hear back.

But a Web search led us to a similar statement that Washington made in the first State of the Union address, Jan. 8, 1790: ""A free people ought not only to be armed, but disciplined.""

Experts told us, though, that Washington was calling for a trained militia to defend the new nation, not anticipating a citizens’ stand against their own government’s tyranny.

The statement comes near the beginning of Washington’s speech:
  
Among the interesting objects, which will engage your attention, that of providing for the common defence will merit particular regard. To be prepared for War is one of the most effectual means of preserving peace. 
A free people ought not only to be armed but disciplined; to which end a uniform and well digested plan is requisite. And their safety and interest require, that they should promote such manufactories, as tend to render them independent on others for essential, particularly for military supplies. 
The proper establishment of the Troops, which may be deemed indispensable, will be entitled to mature deliberation. 

Ron Chernow, whose ""Washington: A Life"" won the 2011 Pulitzer Prize for biography, helped us translate that into 21st-century-ese.

""In this passage, Washington is talking about national defense policy, not individuals arming themselves, and the need for national self-sufficiency in creating military supplies,"" Chernow told us by email.

John Woolley, co-creator of the American Presidency Project at the University of California-Santa Barbara (where we first saw the speech), also said Washington was speaking about external threats and ""not being dependent on imported weapons.""

""He said that as a practical matter, the young and vulnerable USA needed to be prepared to mount an effective defense against other"" nations, Woolley told us by email. The Senate and House both issued formal responses, Woolley said, and ""there is no hint in either of these that the members of Congress thought there was something in that speech about gun rights.""

Washington’s address goes on to say that peaceful measures having failed in regards to ""certain tribes of hostile Indians"" on the southern and western frontiers, ""we ought to be prepared to afford protection to those parts of the Union.""

The ""common defence,"" being prepared for war and having the ability to protect against hostile tribes all refer to outside threats.

Edward Lengel, editor in chief of the Papers of George Washington project at the University of Virginia, told us by email, ""Washington never said, to my knowledge, anything about arms providing a safeguard against any so-called ‘tyranny’ of government.’ ""

In reading the ""armed, but disciplined"" quotation, Lengel said, ""emphasis should be on the word ‘disciplined,’ by which Washington was taking a backhanded swipe at the militia, which he considered undisciplined and next to useless in combat. Washington was all for an ordered, professional standing army under the command of a strong central government.""

But an army was expensive, as Washington wrote in a May 2, 1783, memo to a congressional committee that asked for his advice on how to organize the military in peacetime.

""We are too poor to maintain a standing Army adequate to our defence,"" he said, and suggested a small regular army supplemented by a well-organized militia -- a part-time force of volunteers, called up in emergencies. The Militia Acts of 1792 tracked with the memo’s description, calling for white men 18 to 45 years old to be enrolled in a militia. A cost-cutting provision required them to provide their own arms and ammunition.

So there’s evidence that post-Revolutionary lawmakers expected citizens to own firearms. And, Woolley said, some leaders then undoubtedly ""endorsed views like those Mr. Gohmert expresses -- perhaps more precisely, in order to stay free, the people should have the right to be armed.""

Washington, though, does not appear to have been among them.

Lengel said, ""The idea of resistance to tyranny being dependent on a nation of gun-wielding individuals acting at their own behest or even on local initiative would have been anathema to Washington.

""Indeed, during the (Revolutionary) war he very frequently lamented the crimes carried out by armed civilians or undisciplined militia against their unarmed neighbors. The solution to these crimes, as he understood it, was to increase the power of the government and the army to prevent and punish them -- not to put more guns in the hands of civilians.""

Mary Thompson, research historian at Washington’s Virginia home, Mount Vernon, told us via email, ""Washington’s actual quote is in regard to the people serving in the militia as an arm of the government,"" rather than as an armed resistance to government.

In fact, she said, Washington called up militias to put down just such a rebellion a few years later.

During the Whiskey Rebellion in 1794, she said, ""citizens of Western Pennsylvania rose up to fight a new tax on the whiskey they produced."" Washington was ""concerned that success by the rebels would lead to a diminishment of the central/federal government,"" and directed state militias to counter the insurrection -- ""citizen-soldiers,"" she said, ""acting on behalf of the government against their fellow citizens.""

Our ruling

Gohmert’s rendering, ""George Washington said a free people should be an armed people,"" seemingly tracks Washington’s words to the nation: ""A free people ought not only to be armed, but disciplined.""

Contrary to Gohmert’s characterization, though, Washington was not speaking about citizens arming themselves in case of government tyranny. Quite the opposite: The president and former general was calling for disciplined troops to fight on behalf of the government",False,"January 3, 2013"
"""Connecticut has the fifth toughest gun control laws in the country, including an assault weapons ban that bans 35 different weapons.""","
Even ardent gun rights supporters are willing to talk gun control in the wake of the deadly shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Conn.

During a Dec. 18 grilling by MSNBC anchor Thomas Roberts, U.S. Rep. Jack Kingston said gun control should be ""up for discussion"" alongside violent video games and mental health. The Savannah Republican was endorsed by the National Rifle Association in 2012 and received an A+ grade from the group.

Changing gun laws may not be the answer, though.  

""Connecticut has the fifth toughest gun control laws in the country, including an assault weapons ban that bans 35 different weapons,"" Kingston said.

A Kingston spokesman did not reply to our request for more information, so we searched for state-by-state comparisons of gun control laws and reviewed Connecticut’s assault weapons statute.

The term ""assault weapon"" is controversial. Various state laws use the phrase, although the National Rifle Association argues that gun control advocates created it to ""trick the public into believing that ‘assault weapons’ were fully-automatic machine guns used by the military,"" its website says.  

There’s no formal definition for what counts as an assault weapon. Laws describing them vary. In general, the term refers to a semi-automatic firearm that resembles a fully automatic one or those used by militaries.

Connecticut law generally bans the sale, transfer or possession of assault weapons. State statute defines them in two ways:
  

Connecticut’s law lists 37 guns, not 35, so Kingston’s not far from the mark. Technically speaking, the statute is written so that firearms outside the list can be prohibited, but this is a minor problem.

What about Connecticut’s ranking?

The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence uses a point system to rank states based on whether their statutes met the group’s standards on curbing firearm trafficking; background checks; child safety requirements and other factors.

Connecticut’s laws were ranked the fifth strongest in the nation in 2011, the group’s most recent list. It was bested by California, New Jersey, Massachusetts and New York. Georgia tied for 22nd.

The nutmeg state scored well consistently. We checked the rankings back to 2007 and found it made the top five each time.

Still, Connecticut’s 58 points lagged well behind first place California, which earned 81 points.

The state’s assault weapons ban was one reason why. It earned only three out of a possible 10 points because magazines that carry more than 10 rounds remain legal there. Also, the Brady Campaign prefers a different definition for an assault weapon.  

""While it’s the state with the fifth strongest gun laws, obviously, at 58 points out of 100, there’s a lot more the state can do,"" said Brian Malte, a spokesman for the group.

We found that groups that push for tougher gun laws consistently give Connecticut high marks.

For instance, the San Francisco-based Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence ranked Connecticut fourth in its 2012 report, and fifth in 2010. It assigns points to each state based on 29 aspects of gun law, including the sale and transfer of firearms, owner responsibilities, and rules on their handling in public places.

The center Georgia ranked 24th in 2012.

And Mayors Against Illegal Guns, which boasts membership of more than 700 mayors, including Atlanta’s Kasim Reed, issued a 2010 report that compared states based on whether they enacted 10 key types of gun laws.

Connecticut had put nine of the 10 types in place. Only New York and New Jersey received a 10 out of 10. Georgia had enacted two.

Our conclusion:

Kingston is right on this one. Connecticut consistently ranks high in lists of states with stringent gun laws, and literally ranked fifth in recent rankings by the Brady Campaign and the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.

"""Even hunters are restricted from using large capacity magazines: there is a five cartridge limit for large game hunting, and three for bird hunting.""","The morning after a gunman killed two people and wounded a third at a Clackamas mall, state Sen. Ginny Burdick sent an email to colleagues saying that she planned to introduce legislation to limit the sale of magazines that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition. The shooter, according to news reports, had been able to fire multiple rounds before his gun jammed.  

""Even hunters are restricted from using large capacity magazines: there is a five cartridge limit for large game hunting, and three for bird hunting,"" wrote the Portland Democrat, a longtime advocate of gun control. ""If we limit capacity for hunting animals, why do we not extend that principle to guns that may harm our neighbors?""

Lobbyists for gun shop owners and firearms advocacy groups immediately pounced on her idea, saying that a prohibition on magazine capacity would not stop future shootings. They called Burdick’s proposal terrible, and opportunistic too.

It’s not the job of PolitiFact Oregon to make a ruling on firearms regulations or policy. So we won’t. But we were curious about the numbers in Burdick’s statement and felt it appropriate to check: Does Oregon have a five-cartridge limit for large game hunters, and three for birds?

We turned to the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, which licenses and regulates hunting and fishing on public and private land. Agency spokesman David Lane confirmed that the state senator is correct. There are limits, after which the hunter or shooter would need to reload cartridges or shots.

""It is both for social and for biological reasons,"" Lane said. ""The social being that when somebody takes aim at an animal, they use their shots judiciously … they’re not indiscriminately shooting with the possibility of hitting other animals. It’s a wounded loss issue.""

Now, what Burdick is proposing regarding magazines is not new. We had a federal weapons ban for a decade before it expired in 2004. Part of that law limited magazines to 10 rounds.

Burdick told PolitiFact Oregon that a shooter can be taken down in the few seconds needed to reload. ""It’s simple. It’s clear, and I think it would do some good,"" she said of her proposal.

We could stop here, but we know you love information as much as we do. So we reached out to Kevin Starrett, as well. He is executive director of the Oregon Firearms Federation, a group that calls itself Oregon’s ""only no compromise gun lobby.""

In a spirited interview, he batted the 10-round limit as arbitrary and said reloading magazines can be quick and easy. He said there are countless reasons why a person would want a 30-round magazine, including for sport shooting and to defend themselves and others when trouble breaks. Like someone trying to stop another school or shopping mall shooting. Would you want a limit on rounds then? he asked rhetorically.

That’s a question for policy makers, not fact checkers. There are limits on how hunters shoot wildlife and game in Oregon, even if there are people who think that should have no bearing on the right to bear arms.

Burdick’s statement is accurate",True,"December 28, 2012"
"""You see 34 people (are) murdered every single day"" by gunfire in America.","
Beyond the recent mass shooting at a school in Connecticut, the fear of gun violence is felt nationwide as nearly three dozen Americans are killed by firearms every day, Newark Mayor Cory Booker said.

The Democratic mayor offered that statistic on Sunday during a roundtable discussion on ABC’s ""This Week with George Stephanopoulos."" The guests were discussing the prospect of increased gun control in the wake of the school shooting that left 20 children and seven adults dead, including the shooter himself.

Grover Norquist, an anti-tax activist and a member of the National Rifle Association’s board, argued that Democrats are ""politicizing a tragedy,"" but Booker quickly cut him off.

""One point is very important,"" the mayor said. ""What happened in Connecticut was a grievous tragedy, but every single day in America, every single day, people in communities like mine go to bed fearing violence. You see 34 people (are) murdered every single day.""

PolitiFact New Jersey found that Booker slightly overstated the number of gun-related homicides that occur on a daily basis, according to data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC tracks the causes of deaths for residents of the United States.

The mayor’s claim about 34 murders per day refers to CDC figures showing the average number of Americans killed with guns every day between 2005 and 2009, according to a statement released by the mayor’s office in response to this fact-check.

But the statement acknowledges that, with the CDC’s final numbers for 2010, the five-year rolling average drops slightly to roughly 33 gun-related homicides per day between 2006 and 2010. The 2010 figures represent the most recent final data available.

""Whether we are losing 34 Americans a day, or 33 Americans a day, the point stands that this is an unacceptable and largely correctable epidemic, and the Mayor believes that we must immediately and intensely focus on common-sense, achievable measures that will save lives in Newark and in communities across the country,"" the statement reads.

The number of gun-related murders per day drops even further when you only consider deaths recently recorded in individual years.

In 2010, there were 11,078 gun-related homicides, or roughly 30 per day. According to preliminary figures for 2011, there were 11,101 homicides last year, which also is roughly 30 murders per day.

Both figures represent a roughly 13 percent decrease since there were 12,791 gun-related murders in 2006, or about 35 homicides every day. That statistic represented the highest amount for any year in the last decade.

In fact, the annual number of gun-related homicides dropped every year from 2007 to 2010.

It’s also worth noting that homicides represent only part of all gun-related deaths.

In 2010, for example, there were a total of 31,672 gun-related deaths, including 19,392 suicides and 11,078 homicides. The remaining deaths were classified as unintentional (606); undetermined (252); and legal intervention/war (344).

Our ruling

In a TV appearance, Booker claimed, ""You see 34 people (are) murdered every single day"" by gunfire in America.

The mayor’s statistic isn’t far off. According to the most recent data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a five-year rolling average of final CDC figures puts the number of gun-related murders at about 33 per day.

In terms of individual years, there were about 30 gun-related homicides on a daily basis in 2010 and 2011. That figure marks a reduction since the roughly 35 murders per day recorded in 2006, which was the highest amount for any year in the last decade",Mostly True,"December 27, 2012"

Emblazoned with a picture of a gun painted with stars and stripes, it reports that, ""Last year, handguns killed 48 people in Japan, 8 in Great Britain, 34 in Switzerland, 52 in Canada, 58 in Israel, 21 in Sweden, 42 in West Germany and 10,728 in the United States.""

The version we saw had originally been posted Nov. 24, nearly three weeks before the Connecticut massacre. By Dec. 20, six days after the  tragedy, it had been shared more than 46,000 times. We wondered if the statistics were correct, especially because there hasn't been a ""West Germany"" since 1990.

The illustration invites people to call or write to Handgun Control Inc. in Washington, D.C. The phone number no longer works. That's because in 2001 the group was renamed the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. Brady is James Brady, President Ronald Reagan's press secretary, who was shot and permanently disabled during an assassination attempt on Reagan in 1981.

When we contacted the Brady organization, they sent us a new illustration with different numbers and listing different countries. It says: ""In one year, guns murdered 17 people in Finland, 35 in Australia, 39 in England and Wales, 60 in Spain, 194 in Germany, 200 in Canada, and 9,484 in the United States."" Note that it doesn't specify the year, nor does it specify handguns. It talks about all gun homicides.

Brady also sent us a fact sheet from 2010 that lists its sources, which allowed us to spot-check their statistics. We found that most of the numbers come from 2008, their counts were right on (or close to) the mark, and the reports from other countries do not separate handguns from other firearms, probably because the number of firearm homicides is so small to begin with.

We found more recent United Nations data for some of those countries, and they support the pattern.

Let's pause for a moment to acknowledge two points. First, these statistics deal with murders involving guns, not accidental deaths from firearms. The second is an issue of language. The Facebook posting says ""handguns killed."" The Brady illustration says ""guns murdered."" The correct phrasing would be ""handguns were used to kill"" or ""guns were used to murder.""

The numbers in both illustrations fail to account for a few important factors.

The first is population. The number of gun homicides in Israel is expected to be lower than in the United States because it has fewer than 8 million people compared to more than 313 million in the United States.

Second, the overall homicide rate is generally lower in other Western countries. For example, the murder rate in the United States is more than five times higher than in Germany. A culture where murder is less common is automatically going to have fewer gun deaths.

It's interesting to note how often killers use a gun when they commit a murder. In the United States, two thirds of murders involve firearms. It's less than 10 percent in England and Japan. In Switzerland, it was 72 percent in 2004, although the murder rate is low to begin with. We'll leave it up to gun advocates and opponents to debate the degree to which gun control laws influence the risks reflected in numbers.

Finally, to put the numbers in a broader perspective, many countries have higher rates of gun murders than the United States. They tend to be in South and Central America.

As for the rates in the countries cited in the Facebook posting and the Brady illustration, here are the latest United Nations numbers:

Our ruling

A Facebook posting reported,  ""Last year, handguns killed 48 people in Japan, 8 in Great Britain, 34 in Switzerland, 52 in Canada, 58 in Israel, 21 in Sweden, 42 in West Germany and 10,728 in the United States."" 
The numbers are wildly out of date. They also omit important context, such as population size or a country's cultural attitudes toward the acceptability of violence and gun use. The list also tends to focus on Western well-to-do countries.

But the phenomenon reported in the illustration is correct. The odds of being murdered by a gun in the United States is far in excess of the risk seen in the countries named in the Facebook posting, and in the newer illustration developed by the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence",Half True,"December 23, 2012"
Says the Obama administration plans to ban all weapons for U.S. citizens through international treaties.,"
According to a chain email, President Barack Obama recently ""took the first major step in a plan to ban all firearms in the United States.""

The email, sent to us by a curious Austin reader, continues: ""The Obama administration intends to force gun control and a complete ban on all weapons for U.S. citizens through the signing of international treaties with foreign nations. By signing international treaties on gun control, the Obama administration can use the U.S. State Department to bypass the normal legislative process in Congress.""

Talk about an explosive agenda.

Still, we launched into this look with skepticism since a similar fact-check boiled out to nothing but smoke. U.S. Senate hopeful Craig James drew a Pants on Fire in May 2012 after declaring that Obama and Hillary Clinton were seeking a treaty to ban the use of U.S. firearms.

So we kept the matches handy.

The recent chain email’s references to administration plans are presented as if they were part of an Oct. 14, 2009, Reuters news article headlined: ""U.S. reverses stance on treaty to regulate arms trade.""

Datelined Washington, the actual article opens: ""The United States reversed policy on Wednesday and said it would back launching talks on a treaty to regulate arms sales as long as the talks operated by consensus, a stance critics said gave every nation a veto. The decision, announced in a statement released by the U.S. State Department, overturns the position of former President George W. Bush's administration, which had opposed such a treaty on the grounds that national controls were better.""

In July 2012, the United States participated in the U.N. Conference on the Arms Trade Treaty, but the negotiations adjourned after four weeks amid a lack of consensus, according to a July 27, 2012, New York Times news article. The treaty cannot take effect unless every country signs off.

The Times’ story says that major arms exporters — the United States, Russia and China — had said more time was needed before action. The story says, too, there was friction over whether the treaty would infringe on U.S. gun rights. Also, it says, 51 senators had urged the Obama administration not to sign the treaty — of significance considering U.S. ratification of any treaty would require 67 Senate votes.

According to the story, the treaty would establish common international standards for authorizing international arms transfers. The newspaper said a draft version said a prime purpose is to ""prevent, combat and eradicate the illicit trade in conventional arms and their diversion to illegal and unauthorized end use."" It would also prohibit signatories from transferring conventional weapons that violate arms embargoes or enable those who commit genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, the story says.

So, treaty gone?

Not necessarily. On the day after Obama won re-election, the U.S. backed a U.N. committee’s call to renew debate over the treaty, Reuters reported in a Nov. 7, 2012, news article, adding that such a resolution is expected to clear the U.N. General Assembly, leading to a resumption of talks in March 2013.

The story quotes an unidentified U.S. official as saying: ""We seek a treaty that contributes to international security by fighting illicit arms trafficking and proliferation, protects the sovereign right of states to conduct legitimate arms trade, and meets the concerns that we have been articulating throughout. We will not accept any treaty that infringes on the constitutional rights of our citizens to bear arms,"" the official is quoted as saying.

The story also says that ""U.S. officials have acknowledged privately that the treaty under discussion would have no effect on domestic gun sales and ownership because it would apply only to exports.""

We’re not inclined to rely on comments by unidentified officials. In our James’ fact-check, though, we noted an April 16, 2012, speech to the Stimson Center in Washington by Thomas Countryman, an assistant secretary in the State Department’s Bureau of International Security and Nonproliferation.

Countryman summarized  the administration’s goals for the arms trade treaty conference in part by saying provisions limiting domestic gun rights would not be embraced.

""We will not support outcomes that would in any way infringe on the Second Amendment,"" Countryman said. ""...This has been the position of the executive branch since 2009, and it remains our position today. We will not support or agree to any treaty that would do so. We believe that the international community can draft a treaty on international arms transfers that would both increase international security and still protect sovereign rights of nations. That is the treaty that the United States will pursue in July and for which we expect there will be widespread support.""

As we reviewed this chain email, Ewen Buchanan, spokesman for the U.N. Office for Disarmament Affairs, told us the treaty is intended to apply only to the international arms trade. The U.N. cannot regulate firearms within countries ""on any ground whatsoever,"" Buchanan said. ""It has no domestic jurisdiction.""

Buchanan also provided a June 2012 U.N. ""Myths and Facts"" handout that includes denials the body is contemplating a ban on gun ownership. ""The U.N. is not pursuing a global treaty to ban gun ownership by civilians,"" the handout says. ""Member states are committed to tightening controls over the international import, export and transfers of conventional arms, because without such controls it is easier for weapons to be diverted from the legal trade into the illegal market, and into the hands of terrorists, drug traffickers and criminal cartels.""

The handout also says: ""Each sovereign state determines its own laws and regulations for the manufacture, sale and possession of firearms by its citizens. The United Nations has no jurisdiction over such matters... No UN agreement exists banning firearms possession.""

A July 27, 2012, draft of the treaty makes many references to restricting the international arms trade.

As far as we could tell, it lacks provisions for the international community to regulate firearms within countries. Its preamble even notes the ""legitimate trade and use of certain conventional arms ... for recreational, cultural, historical and sporting activities and lawful ownership where such ownership and use are permitted and protected by law."" The preamble also affirms the sovereign right and responsibility of any country to ""regulate and control transfers of conventional arms that take place exclusively within its territory, pursuant to its own legal or constitutional systems.""

Wayne LaPierre, chief executive of the National Rifle Association, expressed objections to the treaty to the United Nations on July 11, 2012, saying in testimony that the group would drop its opposition only if civilian firearms were not included. The draft treaty says it will apply to all conventional arms including battle tanks; armored combat vehicles; large-caliber artillery systems; combat aircraft; attack helicopters; warships; missiles and missile launchers; and small arms and light weapons.

We called the association to explore how the Obama administration might use the treaty to ban all U.S. weapons and didn’t hear back.

Our ruling

The chain email says the administration plans to ban all weapons for U.S. citizens through international treaties. We found no evidence of such plans, instead consistent indications to the contrary. This chain email is also so off target, it’s ridiculous",False Pants on Fire,"December 11, 2012"
"Says black women are ""fastest-growing demographic group in ... Texas seeking concealed handgun licenses.""","
You might be surprised to learn who cares about the Second Amendment, lawmaker Stefani Carter suggested in a recent USA Today opinion article.

""What is the fastest-growing demographic group in my state of Texas seeking concealed handgun licenses? Black women,"" wrote Carter, a Dallas Republican running for re-election to the Texas House, in the Aug. 30, 2012, piece.

We decided to check out who’s taking advantage lately of Texas’ concealed-handgun law, which since January 1996 has allowed permit holders to carry such guns in most public places while excluding others, such as churches.

Katy Aldredge, a deputy district director for Carter, told us Carter’s main source was a July 12, 2012, post on The Volokh Conspiracy, a conservative-leaning legal analysis blog written by law professor Eugene Volokh of the University of California-Los Angeles. Aldredge also sent us links to annual reports on concealed handgun licenses on the Texas Department of Public Safety website.

Aldredge said Carter found Volokh’s blog and compared his data to the DPS reports of licenses issued. (We did the same, and the data matches.) Aldredge also said that despite the word ""seeking"" in her article, Carter was discussing licenses issued, not applications.

In his blog post, Volokh looked at how many of the permits issued in each year went to black men and women and white men and women. By email, he told us that he did not look at the DPS’ other race groupings because they were too small or too unclear. Those categories are ""American Indian or Alaskan Native,"" ""Asian or Pacific Islander,"" ""Multi-Racial"" and ""Other/Unknown."" Volokh’s post said that most Hispanics seem to be counted as ""white"" in the DPS numbers, ""following the modern demographic approach of treating Hispanic as an ethnicity rather than as a separate race.""

But Hispanics are Texas’ largest minority. According to the latest state QuickFacts sheet from the U.S. Census Bureau, Texas’ 2011 demographics (including some overlap) were: 44.8 percent white, 38.1 percent Hispanic, 12.2 percent black, 4 percent Asian, 1 percent ""American Indian and Alaska Native,"" 0.1 percent ""Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander.""

The DPS numbers, not separating Hispanic and white, show that of the CHL permits issued in 2011, 86.5 percent went to whites, 6.8 percent to black, 3.4 percent to ""other/unknown,"" 2 percent to ""Asian or Pacific Islander,"" 1 percent to ""multi-racial,"" and 0.33 percent to ""American Indian or Alaskan Native"" Texans.

Volokh’s analysis found that among black and white permit recipients, from 1996 through 2011, the percentage of women in the total was consistently smaller than the percentage of men but that this gender gap was narrowing slightly.

The uptick among black women, he said, was ""especially striking"": Black women got less than 1 percent of the 317,205 permits issued from 1996 through 2000, he said, but got 1.63 percent of the 558,190 permits issued from 2007 through 2011.

Seeking another expert view, we contacted conservative writer John Lott, whom we saw cited in an April 24, 2012, New York Times news story that discussed ""growth in the number of people with concealed-carry permits"" nationwide; the Times described Lott as ""a researcher of gun culture who has held teaching or research posts at a number of universities, including the University of Chicago.""

When we asked him by email about Carter’s statement, Lott took a look at Texas data from 2000 through 2011, comparing the number of permit recipients in a particular race category each year with the number of people in that race category who got permits in 2000.

The jump in multi-racial women permit holders from 2000 to 2011 was the most extreme, but Lott cautioned that result is exaggerated because the category is small -- meaning the addition of a few people can dramatically alter the percent change -- and because more people these days describe themselves as multi-racial than in 2000.

Throwing out that category because of its size -- as Volokh did -- Lott told us, ""Carter is correct that black females since 2000 have had the largest percentage increase.""

He created this chart of the Texas data for us:

That’s a lot of little colored lines, but we determined that the DPS numbers back up Lott’s finding: The biggest increase between 2000 and 2011 was in the category of multi-racial female permit recipients, which jumped from 28 in 2000 to 318 in 2011. That 139-person difference produced the 1035.7 percent change charted by the dark-brown line at top.

The number of black female permit-holders rose 554 percent from 2000 to 2011 -- a smaller percent change, but involving a larger number of people: 2,046. The records show 369 black women in Texas had CHLs in 2000 and 2,415 had them in 2011.

In a later interview, Volokh took a look at the multi-racial numbers and agreed they were statistically unreliable, for the same reasons: because it was such a small group and some of its growth likely came as people began adopting that term for themselves.

""I’d still say that black women were the fastest-growing demographic group of any substantial size,"" he told us.

But that observation, like Lott’s and Carter’s, is limited by the demographic groups DPS used. Without breaking out Hispanics -- nearly 40 percent of Texans -- separately, we see no way to give an accurate picture of the demographics and changes among Texas’ concealed-carry permit holders.

Carter’s piece didn’t mention the lack of data on Hispanics.

Why such changes occurred is murkier. Carter’s opinion article cites some statistics about crime against black women and mentions nationwide increases in women owning guns. Volokh limited his analysis to the numbers rather than the reasons behind them.

Lott told us that black women as a group overlap with the two categories of people who benefit the most from concealed-carry permits, according to his research: people who are physically weaker than assailants (primarily women and elderly people) and people who are likely victims of violent crime, including low-income residents of high-crime urban areas.


Our ruling

Carter claims black women are the fastest-growing group of permit-seekers.

We accept her explanation that she meant to refer to permits issued each year. And her statement fairly captures available data and research.

However, the lack of information on Hispanic permit recipients makes it impossible to conclude which Texas subgroups are getting permits most often",Half True,"October 5, 2012"
"Bill Nelson voted to confirm Sonia Sotomayor, ""who signed a Supreme Court opinion saying Americans do not have an individual right to own firearms.""","
The National Rifle Association wants Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson out of office.

A flier mailed to some Floridians by the NRA’s Institute for Legislative Action compares Nelson’s record on gun control with that of his Republican opponent in the U.S. Senate race, U.S. Rep. Connie Mack IV.

One of its points: ""Bill Nelson voted to confirm Barack Obama's anti-gun nominees to the Supreme Court -- including Sonia Sotomayor who signed a Supreme Court opinion saying Americans do not have an individual right to own firearms.""

For this fact-check, we wanted to confirm whether Nelson voted for Sotomayor and if she signed an opinion that said ""Americans do not have an individual right to own firearms.""

The first part is easy for us: Nelson voted to confirm Sotomayor, Obama’s first Supreme Court nominee and the country’s first Hispanic justice, on Aug. 6, 2009, in a 68-31 vote.

The second part -- that she signed a Supreme Court opinion saying Americans do not have an individual right to own firearms -- is a little harder to understand (at least, for those of us not trained in legalese).

An NRA spokesman refused to elaborate on the ad’s claim for PolitiFact Florida, including which opinion is even at issue here. Still, given her short tenure and the scarcity of possible gun rulings, it didn’t take long to figure out.

McDonald vs. Chicago

It may not say it, but the ad is a reference to the 2010 Supreme Court case McDonald vs. Chicago, which dealt with handgun bans in Chicago and the Chicago suburb of Oak Park.

It picked up where a landmark (pre-Sotomayor) Supreme Court decision left off. In 2008, the court ruled in District of Columbia vs. Heller that the Second Amendment includes an individual right of gun ownership, overturning a D.C. ban on handguns.

Heller dealt with federal law and left undetermined whether this interpretation of the Second Amendment applied to state and local government restrictions on guns.  In McDonald, the court had to decide whether to ""incorporate"" the Second Amendment against the states. (Since the Civil War, the court has ""incorporated,"" or extended, amendments within the Bill of Rights against state and local governments under the due process and equal protection provisions of the 14th Amendment.)

By a 5-4 majority, the court argued in McDonald that the Second Amendment guarantees an individual right to own a gun against the regulations of state and local governments. The New York Times called the case ""an enormous symbolic victory for gun rights.""

This wasn’t the ruling Sotomayor wanted. She signed a 31-page dissenting opinion written by Justice Stephen Breyer and co-signed by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, both Bill Clinton appointees.

Breyer’s opinion argued that using guns for self-defense did not warrant federal constitutional protection. The Heller decision, Breyer wrote, was grounded in an ambiguous historical record that did not substantiate a private self-defense right against the states. The Second Amendment was enacted to protect militia-related rights, he said, and decisions on gun control should be determined by local governments and legislatures.

Many news accounts of the ruling honed in on this line from the conclusion: ""In sum, the Framers did not write the Second Amendment in order to protect a private right of armed self-defense.""

That mirrors the NRA’s claim about Sotomayor, said many experts we consulted.

""This is an easy one,"" said Ilya Shapiro, a senior fellow in constitutional studies at the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute.

""The characterization of her opinion is accurate,"" said David Kopel, research director of the libertarian-leaning Independence Institute and an adjunct constitutional law professor at Denver University. ""She joined an opinion that said Heller should be overruled.""

Advocates of gun control saw more nuance.

""It was certainly not anti-gun,"" said Daniel Vice, senior attorney at the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence. ""The dissenting opinion did not pick a side in the gun debate.""

At issue was the more technical question about incorporating private armed self-defense as a ""fundamental"" right, he said. Was the right to keep a gun at home as central to U.S. citizenship as voting, freedom of speech and freedom religion that it deserved protection under the due process clause of the 14th Amendment?

""That’s a different question than the question of whether the right exists or not,"" said Brian Van Houten, Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence managing attorney. ""(The NRA) presented a very dramatic claim about Justice Sotomayor’s opinion in McDonald, but it doesn’t match the reality of what was said there.""

Others urged us to consider the alternative. If the opinion of Breyer and Sotomayor prevailed, states would have a lot more freedom to regulate gun ownership.

""Effectively, (the NRA) may be correct in the sense that had the court ruled that the Second Amendment was not incorporated, it would have left the states free to legislate in any way they choose,"" said William Vizzard, California State University Sacramento criminal justice professor.

We should expect litigation out of McDonald for years to come, he said. 
The important note to all of this, of course, is that Nelson voted to confirm Sotomayor before her vote in McDonald. In the mailer, the NRA fails to provide this context, which in turn could confuse voters. 
Our ruling

The NRA is correct in saying Nelson voted to confirm Sonia Sotomayor as an associate justice of the Supreme Court. And many experts see the group’s assertion that she signed an opinion ""saying Americans do not have an individual right to own firearms"" as fair.

We heard lots of agreement from experts about this characterization, though two advocates of gun control said it is over-simplified. Gun-control supporters in particular told us the opinion she signed is not as ""anti-gun"" as the mailer would have readers believe. 
What's missing from this attack is the context that Nelson voted to confirm Sotomayor before she signed the opinion in McDonald. That context slightly dulls the connection between Nelson and Sotomayor's position",Mostly True,"September 26, 2012"
"Says that ""you can’t destroy the guns purchased in a (gun) buyback program as the city (of Memphis) wants to do.""","
Colorful State Sen. Stacey Campfield seems to court controversy, particularly in his blog, Camp4u.

So it was no real surprise when he took a reproachful tone in blog posts on Sept. 11 about the ""gas for guns"" program announced the day before by the City of Memphis and the Memphis Police Department. The city held a press conference on Sept. 10 to announce that on Sept. 15, it would conduct an event in which it would give people a $50 Mapco gas card plus two tickets to a Memphis Grizzlies basketball game for turning in a gun. The idea was to get guns off the streets, and 497 guns were exchanged for the cards and tickets at the event. The city said most of the guns would be ""destroyed.""

""I don’t think they can do that,"" Campfield wrote in his first blog post on the gas for guns program, adding that ""…the point of this post is that the city is saying they intend on destroying the guns they buy. I may be wrong but didn’t we change the law to say they have to resell the guns now?""

The senator cited the Tennessee legislature passing a bill in 2010 regarding what local law enforcement can do with guns but acknowledged he might be wrong with exactly whether it applied to gun ""buyback"" programs similar to the Memphis initiative.

Nearly an hour later, Campfield  posted a second item that sounded as if he had verified that the city’s program could not destroy the guns as it intended. Under the headline ""Sorry Memphis,"" the senator wrote: ""I was right. The city of Memphis/Memphis PD is wrong (I know, a real shocker). As I recalled, you can’t destroy the guns purchased in a gun buy program as the city wants to do. They have to be re sold (sic) to a licensed gun dealer. Someone should alert them. I would hate to see our law enforcement in violation of the law.""

Clearly, somebody was firing a dud, so we decided to look into the matter.

Campfield was recalling the 2010 law that prohibits local law enforcement from destroying certain guns, but his recollection was a little off on which guns. Tennessee Code Annotated 39-17-1317 governs the disposition of ""confiscated weapons"" only, and the 2010 amendment to the statute removed destruction of guns as an option for confiscated guns, unless they are certified by local police as ""inoperable or unsafe.""

But otherwise, after a confiscated gun is no longer needed for evidence, local law enforcement may ask a court to declare it contraband. ""Any weapon declared contraband shall be sold in a public sale or used for legitimate law enforcement purposes, at the discretion of the court."" The law goes on to say how the gun must be sold -- a public auction or through a private gun dealer.

When the 2010 amendment was briefly discussed in the legislature, its sponsors said it was sought by the National Rifle Association. The NRA in fact posted on its website an alert encouraging its members to urge then-Gov. Phil Bredesen to sign it into law. He did.

Campfield linked to the NRA’s 2010 alert in his blog post, but even the alert made note that the law applies only to confiscated guns: The bill ""would prohibit the destruction of confiscated firearms and require them to be auctioned off or sold to a federally licensed firearms dealer,"" it said.

But can guns voluntarily surrendered by people to the police – even if in exchange for cash or gasoline debit cards or pro basketball tickets – be considered ""confiscated"" under the law?

Ultimately, that may be a question for the courts if anyone challenges the legality of the program, but our dictionary says ""confiscate"" means ""appropriated by the government; forfeited; deprived of property by confiscation,"" and ""to seize as forfeited to the public treasury; to seize by authority.""

Memphis believes its program is within the state law, city spokeswoman Mary Cashiola wrote in an email to The Commercial Appeal: ""The firearms collected during Saturday’s Gas for Guns event will be turned in voluntarily by citizens. . . . The Memphis Police Department will take possession of the exchanged weapons and will handle these weapons in accordance with State law.""  
The state attorney general’s office does not appear to have rendered a legal opinion on the statute, so we turned to Nashville lawyer John Harris, a gun advocate who founded the Tennessee Firearms Association.

Harris told us in an email hat he doesn’t believe the law prohibits Memphis from destroying guns obtained through the gas for guns initiative. ""As I understand it, TCA 39-17-1317 only applies to weapons that were ‘possessed, used or sold in violation of the law’ and, based on that use, ‘confiscated by a law enforcement officer and declared to be contraband by a court of record exercising criminal jurisdiction.’ The prohibition on the destruction of such weapons under this statute (with limited exceptions) thus only applies to those weapons that were specifically ‘confiscated’ and ‘declared to be contraband’. I do not think that the statute would apply on its face to firearms ‘buy back’ programs conduct by state or local agencies.""

Harris did say, however, that he believes the ""intentional destruction of functional weapons violates the spirit of the law"" and that he anticipates that the TFA will seek to close the buyback loophole. ""While it might appear to be ‘politically correct’ to destroy legal items with material value, it’s foolish and government should not be doing foolish things,"" he said.

Contacted by PolitiFact on Sept. 20, Campfield said he had already changed his mind on his blog post, after speaking with legislative lawyers. ""For buybacks, it is different than for guns confiscated. The way it was originally written it would have covered buybacks. But when I had legal look at it, I don’t think it covers buybacks. All the early stuff I had said, no they can’t do it.""

Our ruling

It is PolitiFact policy to take into account when someone later acknowledges an original claim was somehow incorrect. Often, those statements are made during live interviews, but in this case Campfield took the time to write up and post not one but two items onto his blog declaring that it would be illegal for Memphis to destroy guns purchased in a buy-back program.

Campfield hadn’t altered his blog post as of this writing",False,"September 26, 2012"
"""Bill Nelson voted for a ban on millions of commonly owned firearms, which included many popular hunting and target rifles.""","
A National Rifle Association website fires several shots at U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson’s voting record. The NRA has given an ""F"" to Nelson and an ""A"" to his opponent U.S. Rep. Connie Mack IV, R-Fort Myers.

One of the attacks on the website says: ""Bill Nelson voted for a ban on millions of commonly owned firearms, which included many popular hunting and target rifles.""

In this fact-check, we wanted to explore if the NRA accurately described Nelson’s vote on a gun ban. The attack relates to a 2004 vote Nelson took in favor of extending the assault weapons ban of 1994. The vote to extend it came in the form of an amendment that passed the Senate 52-47 on March 2, 2004. 
The amendment was to a bill to prohibit civil lawsuits from being brought against gun manufacturers and distributors for damages from misuse of firearms. The overall bill overwhelmingly was defeated 8-90 with Nelson voting ""no"" in the majority -- so that meant the effort to extend the ban also failed.

But did the assault weapons ban that Nelson wanted extend to millions of commonly owned firearms, including those used by hunters?

Clinton signed assault weapons ban in 1994

The original assault weapons ban of 1994 prohibited the manufacture or possession of semiautomatic assault weapons and banned guns that had two listed military-style features. The law only applied to newly manufactured weapons, grandfathering in millions of guns.

The bill also contained a list of more than 600 hunting or sporting shotguns or rifles that remained legal.

The law expired in 2004 after attempts in Congress to renew it failed. The Violence Policy Center warned that simply renewing the ban wouldn’t be enough, because manufacturers found ways around the law by making some cosmetic changes to create ""after-ban"" models.

The NRA declined our request to provide documentation to support their claim that the law resulted in a ban on millions of commonly owned firearms including popular hunting firearms.

But the NRA did provide some documentation to PolitiFact Wisconsin that fact-checked an NRA radio ad attacking Democrat Tom Barrett, who ultimately lost his recall challenge against Republican Gov. Scott Walker. The NRA said when Barrett was in Congress, he ""voted to ban 15 different kinds of guns, even a lot of common deer rifles."" PolitiFact Wisconsin ruled that claim Mostly False.

The NRA cited newspaper and magazine articles from the late 1980s and early 1990s. The articles showed that some deer hunters used weapons targeted by the ban, but the articles were largely anecdotal and deer hunting experts said the banned weapons were not commonly used for deer hunting when the ban became law in 1994.

ATF data and experts on the ban

Data from the federal bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms about the number of guns manufactured in the U.S showed a drop during the lifetime of the ban from about 5.1 million in 1994 to 3.1 million in 2004. (Years after the ban expired, it soared to about 5.5 million in 2010.)

But the ATF doesn’t have categories for guns by their intended use (for hunting versus crime, for example) but instead shows it by pistols, revolvers, rifles, shotguns and a smaller category for miscellaneous. During the ban the number of manufactured pistols, revolvers and shotguns dropped considerably while the number of rifles increased slightly.

The other research we found focused on the impact on crime or the availability of assault weapons -- not about the impact for hunters.

We interviewed experts about the assault weapons ban including Daniel Vice, an attorney at the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and Kristen Rand, Legislative Director for the Violence Policy Center -- two groups that fight gun violence and are often on the opposite side of the NRA. (When the assault ban came up for renewal, the Brady Center supported continuing it, while the VPC argued that the ban was flawed and didn’t go far enough.)

We also interviewed Christopher S. Koper, an associate professor at George Mason University. All three of our experts disagreed with the NRA’s claim.

Since Nelson’s 2004 vote was simply to extend the ban, it couldn’t have banned ""millions of commonly owned firearms"" as the NRA claimed, Vice said in an email. The 1994 ban ""only banned the sale or possession of newly manufactured guns,"" not guns already owned by people.

Also, the ban specifically exempted hundreds of hunting weapons by name, Vice said.

Koper, the professor who wrote a report about the ban for the DOJ, said that the NRA’s claim is misleading. The purpose of the ban was to restrict weapons with multiple military-style features which were less appropriate for hunting purposes. And the list of hundreds of firearms that were exempted, ""were deemed to be more appropriate for hunting."" Also, gun manufacturers continued to make weapons very similar to the banned weapons by removing some or all of the military-style features, allowing sport shooters to get similar substitutes in many cases.

Nelson’s response

Nelson has long supported a ban on assault weapons, including while in Congress in the 1980s. In 1990, when he was running for governor, Nelson made his call for a state assault weapons ban a focus of his campaign even as he said he still supported gun rights.

""I'm for the constitutional right to bear arms,"" Nelson said then. ""I'm a hunter and so is my son.""

But Nelson said youngsters were taking submachine guns to school, and Colombian drug lords were buying their weapons in Florida.

At campaign stops in 1990, Nelson waved an AK-47 over his head and said that a campaign aide was able to buy buy an AK-47 semiautomatic rifle in less than 10 minutes at a Miami gun store.

A spokesman for Nelson’s Senate office, Bryan Gulley, cited some more recent examples of Nelson’s pro-gun votes: He voted for an amendment to permit Amtrak passengers to transport guns in checked baggage and for an amendment to allow individuals to possess firearms in the national parks in 2009.

Our ruling 
The NRA said that ""Bill Nelson voted for a ban on millions of commonly owned firearms, which included many popular hunting and target rifles.""

In 2004, Nelson voted to extend the 1994 assault weapons ban.

Yes, some hunters used the types of firearms that were then banned. But the ban applied to newly manufactured weapons, and gun makers quickly found ways to tweak banned guns to create ""after ban"" guns. Hunters or sportsmen still had plenty of choices -- literally hundreds since the ban explicitly listed more than 600 weapons used for hunting that remained legal",False,"September 25, 2012"
"""Fast and Furious"" began under the Bush administration.","
President Barack Obama is far ahead with Hispanic voters, but he faced tough questions during a Univision interview at the University of Miami on Sept. 20, 2012.

Interviewer Jorge Ramos asked Obama about the controversial ""Fast and Furious"" program, in which federal agents allowed guns to be sold and brought into Mexico so they could trace the weapons. But the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) ended up losing track of some of the guns. Two were found at the crime scene where U.S. Border Patrol agent Brian Terry was killed on Dec. 14, 2010.

""I think it’s important for us to understand that the Fast and Furious program was a field-initiated program begun under the previous administration,"" Obama responded. ""When (Attorney General) Eric Holder found out about it, he discontinued it. We assigned an inspector general to do a thorough report that was just issued, confirming that in fact Eric Holder did not know about this, that he took prompt action and the people who did initiate this were held accountable.""

Several readers wrote to us that Fast and Furious did not start under President George W. Bush, so we decided to check it out.

A day before Obama’s Univision interview, the U.S. Department of Justice’s Inspector General released a 512-page report about Fast and Furious.

""Our review of Operation Fast and Furious and related matters revealed a series of misguided strategies, tactics, errors in judgment and management failures,"" the report noted.

The report also clearly shows that Fast and Furious began under the Obama administration, dating its inception to October 2009. (Obama took office in January 2009.) This directly contradicts Obama’s claim.

There is one mitigating factor, however: A program similar to Fast and Furious did go forward under the Bush administration in 2006 and 2007. That program, called Operation Wide Receiver, also attempted to track suspicious weapons. Allowing gun sales to go forward even when the ATF had probable cause to believe the sales were unlawful has come to be known as ""gun walking.""

The two operations -- Fast and Furious and Wide Receiver -- had some similarities, and both were run out of the ATF’s Phoenix Field Division. The inspector general explored both programs in depth and found similar problems.

""The risk to public safety was immediately evident in both investigations,"" the inspector general’s report states.

The White House told us that Obama was referring to the general practice of gun walking, which happened in both administrations. ""The President was referring to the flawed tactic of gun-walking, which despite Republicans efforts to politicize this issue, began under the previous administration and it was our attorney general who ended it,"" said White House spokesman Eric Schultz.

U.S. Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., chairman of the House Oversight & Government Reform Committee, and Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa, the senior Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, issued their own 211-page investigative report this summer. The investigations led House Republicans to hold Attorney General Holder in contempt for failing to satisfy their requests for documents. House Democrats walked out on the criminal contempt vote, which passed 255-67.

Our ruling

Obama said that the Fast and Furious program began ""under the previous administration."" That is not the case; Fast and Furious did begin during the time Obama held office.

Another similar program, called Operation Wide Receiver, did happen during the Bush administration, and a recent inspector general’s report criticized both operations as ineffective and seriously flawed.

But Operation Wide Receiver is not the same thing as the Fast and Furious program",False,"September 24, 2012"
"Says Charlie Crist ""was pro-life, pro-gun and vehemently anti-tax.""","
After former Florida Gov. Charlie Crist endorsed President Barack Obama and secured a speaking spot at the Democratic National Convention, Republicans pulled out the Crist files to highlight how much the Republican-turned-independent Crist had changed in just four years.

George LeMieux, a Republican and a former Crist chief of staff, wrote a biting op-ed about Crist’s former stances.

""He never met a tax increase he liked. ... The Charlie Crist I knew idolized Ronald Reagan and embraced Reagan's view of limited government. He was pro-life, pro-gun and vehemently anti-tax. He believed big government was the enemy of success, and that when government taxed it took ‘your money.’""

In this fact-check we will explore whether Crist was ""pro-life, pro-gun and vehemently anti-tax.""

First, we will note what Crist said of himself in February 2010: ""I am pro-life, I’m pro-gun, I’m pro-family and I’m anti-tax. And I always have been."" He made those claims at a Christian Family Coalition breakfast while running for U.S. Senate as a Republican. He would ditch the GOP label for no-party about two months later as he was struggling in his primary bid against Marco Rubio.

 ""Pro-life""

Crist’s stance on abortion over his political career is too complex to boil down to a sound bite -- even if Crist tried to do that himself at times.

When he was running for the U.S. Senate in 1998, Crist said in a questionnaire for the Tampa Bay Times that he was pro-choice, but not pro-abortion. ""I believe that a woman has the right to choose, but would prefer only after careful consideration and consultation with her family, her physician and her clergy; not her government,"" he said. Crist said in a debate during that campaign that he would not support a constitutional ban on abortion.

In 2006, when he was running for governor, Crist said he was pro-life. But he would not support repealing Roe vs. Wade and opposed a 24-hour waiting period. ""I don't think that politicians ought to put themselves in the place of physicians, and I think it's very important to respect the medical profession,"" said Crist, whose father is a doctor.

In 2010, as a Republican U.S. Senate candidate, Crist said he would ""fight for pro-life legislative efforts.""

But later in 2010, after leaving the Republican Party, Crist vetoed a bill that would have required women seeking abortions to get an ultrasound. He said he found the requirement that women pay for the procedure ""punitive"" and that the measure was ""almost mean spirited.""

 ""Pro-gun""

When Crist was running for U.S. Senate in 2010, we reviewed a claim that he ""never wavered in his support of the Second Amendment, the right to bear arms."" We ruled that claim True and will briefly review what we found for that article.

In one of his first high-profile gun battles, then-state senator Crist blasted Gov. Lawton Chiles' last-minute effort to require criminal background checks and a waiting period for purchases made at gun shows in 1998. The legislation proposal died.

As attorney general, Crist nominated Marion P. Hammer, former president of the National Rifle Association, to the Florida Women's Hall of Fame, and she was inducted in 2004. Hammer is also the longtime president of the state’s NRA affiliate Unified Sportsmen of Florida.

In his 2006 primary against Republican rival Tom Gallagher, Crist ran an ad calling Gallagher ""anti-gun"" and highlighting Crist’s endorsement from the NRA. As governor, Crist signed into law legislation that allowed 500,000 concealed weapons permit-holders to bring their guns to work as long as the weapons remained in their vehicles.

""Anti-tax""

To examine Crist’s actions about taxes, we reviewed multiple reports from Florida TaxWatch and newspaper articles. We also interviewed staff at Florida TaxWatch as well as Amy Baker, the state’s chief economist. Here are some highlights from his tenure as governor:

2007: Crist repeatedly promised Floridians that their taxes would ""drop like a rock."" Crist and the Legislature attempted to deliver that through a question put to voters, Amendment 1, which increased the homestead property tax exemption. Voters approved it in January 2008.

Kurt Wenner, vice president of tax research at Florida TaxWatch, said that taxes didn’t really drop like a rock but ""there was some reduction in them."" But much of that happened due to the decline in property values.

In his first proposed budget in 2007, Crist called for continuing sales tax holidays and reducing the communications services tax.

2008: Crist’s budget proposal suggested dealing with a drop in revenues by using reserves and trust funds. He recommended two more sales tax holidays, one for hurricane
preparedness and one for back-to-school, a savings to taxpayers of $36 million.

2009: Crist’s budget didn’t call for general tax hikes, but he did ultimately support a $1 a pack cigarette tax hike and surcharge on other tobacco products. That tax hike added up to about $1 billion a year, said Dominic Calabro, president of Florida TaxWatch.

Crist also signed a budget that included new fees including a package of increased and new Highway Safety Fees for about $1 billion in recurring dollars.

The Miami Herald quoted Crist as saying: ""The cigarette tax is appropriate and I really view it more as a health issue than I do as a tax issue.''

If Crist had vetoed the cigarette tax, the state would have lost nearly $2 billion in federal Medicaid matching funds.

The Tampa Bay Times wrote that Crist would call taxes the ""T-word"" as if it was an obscenity but would warm up if called a ""user fee.""

2010: TaxWatch wrote that Crist’s budget proposal in January 2010 called for $2.7 billion in increased spending and $100 million in tax cuts by relying on federal money, Seminole gambling Compact and raiding trust funds.

Calabro said that Crist could have done more to reign in spending during his tenure.

But Wenner said that ""generally throughout his career (Crist) was in favor of reducing taxes for the average Floridian.""

Our ruling

LeMieux said that Gov. Charlie Crist ""was pro-life, pro-gun and vehemently anti-tax."" Crist did describe himself in similar language in 2010 while he was still a Republican and running for U.S. Senate. And we agree that he was consistently for gun rights.

His record on abortion was more mixed. At different times, he called himself ""pro-life"" and he called himself ""pro-choice."" And even when he called himself ""pro-life"" in 2006, he said he would not support overturning Roe vs. Wade. In 2010, he earned cheers from abortion rights supporters when he vetoed a bill that would force women who are getting abortions to undergo an ultrasound.

Crist portrayed himself as anti-tax and generally avoided tax increases, although he did support the cigarette tax hike and other increases in fees",Mostly True,"September 6, 2012"
"Florida has ""more concealed weapons permits than any other state.""","
After yucking it up on a Gulf of Mexico fishing trip, Govs. Rick Perry and Rick Scott sat for a wide-ranging interview with Fox News Channel’s Your World with Neil Cavuto.

In the interview (transcript here), the governors talked about why Scott and not Perry was selected to speak at the Republican National Convention in Tampa, as well as Mitt Romney’s decision to select U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., as his running mate. They also were asked to comment about a recent shooting near Texas A&M University.

Both Perry and Scott cautioned about using the shooting as evidence that people’s gun rights should be restricted.

Scott then stated an amazing statistic about guns, if true.

""I mean, I think we have more concealed weapons permits than any other state because Floridians care about their right to bear arms.""

Florida is the fourth-most populous state in the country, so it’s no surprise it would be high on a concealed permit list. But is it No. 1 ahead of Perry’s Texas, which has 6 million more residents, and California, which is nearly double the size?

Turns out, yes. Scott is correct.

The U.S. Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, recently studied the number of active concealed weapons permits by state. Their report, available here, is dated July 2012 and includes concealed weapons permit data as of Dec. 31, 2011, in most cases.

The top 10 of valid permits by state breaks down like this:

1. Florida -- 887,000;
2. Pennsylvania -- 786,000;
3. Georgia -- 600,000;
4. Texas -- 519,000;
5. Indiana -- 406,000;
6. Washington -- 351,000;
7. Utah -- 347,000;
8. Tennessee -- 341,000;
9. Michigan -- 296,000;
10. Virginia -- 279,000.

There’s two caveats to this list. First, several states, including Florida, allow out-of-state residents to acquire concealed weapons permits. So people living outside of Florida may have a Florida permit. Records don’t distinguish by location.

Second, it’s worth noting that many states have reciprocity agreements regarding concealed weapons permits, meaning that a Texas license is valid in Florida and vice versa.

We don’t think either is enough to question the validity of Scott’s remark, however.

Three large states are missing from the Top 10 list. Illinois does not issue concealed weapons permits. California and New York are considered a ""may issue"" states, which gives those states much more discretion over who gets a permit. That in turn makes it harder to get one.

As a result, California has just 35,000 active permits, representing .1 percent of the adult active population, according to the analysis. Florida, a ""shall issue"" state, had a concealed weapons permit rate of 6.2 percent of its active adult population. Georgia ranks first at 11 percent.

Our ruling

Scott said Florida has ""more concealed weapons permits than any other state."" A recent U.S. Government Accountability Office study backs Scott up. The state has about 887,000 valid concealed weapons permits, nearly 100,000 more than the next closest state, Pennsylvania",True,"August 14, 2012"
"A United Nations arms treaty would ""almost certainly force"" the U.S. to ""create an international gun registry, setting the stage for full-scale gun confiscation.""","
U.S. Rep. Paul Broun wants you to reach for your checkbook. A Second Amendment rights group needs money to keep the United Nations from coming for your guns.

The Athens Republican made his pitch in a YouTube video posted by the National Association for Gun Rights.

""If passed by the U.N. and ratified by the U.S. Senate, the U.N. Small Arms Treaty would almost certainly force the United States to … create an international gun registry, setting the stage for full-scale gun confiscation,"" Broun said during the video posted July 10.

Treaty negotiations fell apart in late July, but advocates are hopeful that a version will pass soon.

We therefore took a closer look.

PolitiFact Georgia asked Broun for more information, but his spokeswoman refused repeated requests for comment.

We soldiered on. PolitiFact Georgia interviewed gun rights experts, especially those who, like Broun, are critical of gun control. We also consulted past PolitiFact coverage of the arms treaty.

The U.N. has mulled over a treaty to regulate the global arms trade for years. Backers say it would curtail mass killings and terrorism, and keep dictators from killing their own people.

(Small arms are not the treaty’s sole focus, as Broun’s description suggests. Conventional weapons, including guns, missiles and attack helicopters, are.)

The George W. Bush administration rebuffed the effort, but the Obama administration said in 2009 that it is open to negotiations.

In 2010, PolitiFact National evaluated a claim that under the treaty, ""all U.S. citizens will be subject to those gun laws created by foreign governments.""

In the unlikely event that the president and two-thirds of the Senate agreed to a treaty that bans guns and requires their confiscation, long-standing Supreme Court precedent would make it unenforceable, it said in ruling the claim False.

In May, PolitiFact Texas tested a claim that ""Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton are negotiating with the United Nations about doing a treaty that will ban the use of firearms.""

It ruled Pants on Fire because an administration official recently said the U.S. will not back a treaty that infringes on the Second Amendment.

So ""full-scale gun confiscation"" in the U.S. is out of the picture. What about an international gun registry?

Gun control critics pointed us to a July 26 draft posted on the website of a pro-disarmament group.

Article 2 states that each party ""shall establish or update, as appropriate, and maintain a national control list"" that would include battle tanks, attack helicopters and guns, among other things.

""Even the most limited reading of the treaty suggests that, while it would not create an international registry of all guns, it seeks to create one of all imported guns,"" said Ted Bromund, a senior research fellow with the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank.

But no treaty language establishes a worldwide registry of individuals who own guns or dealers who sell to customers in their own countries.

In fact, the draft affirms the ""sovereign right and responsibility of any State to regulate and control transfers of conventional arms that take place exclusively within its territory, pursuant to its own legal or constitutional systems.""

Prior General Assembly resolutions contain similar language.

Official U.N. statements emphasize that a treaty would regulate international import, export and transfers of conventional arms only.

""Nobody wants to control the transfer of weapons inside a country,"" said Tom Collina, the research director of the Arms Control Association.

Of course, this version of the treaty failed in U.N. negotiations. Even if it had succeeded, U.S. ratification would be unlikely, our anti-gun control experts agreed.

Still, we opted to take Broun’s statement further. He posits an alternate political reality where leaders ratify a treaty that could lead the U.S. to create a registry to track -- and ultimately confiscate -- guns.

PolitiFact Georgia asked legal experts whether one would be constitutional.

They gave differing opinions. The Supreme Court has not ruled on the issue.

Eugene Volokh, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, thinks registries would pass constitutional muster because they don’t ""materially interfere with the ability to keep guns for self-defense.""

Dave Kopel, a legal expert with the pro-free market Independence Institute, called registration a ""gray area, legally speaking.""  A future court could overturn Second Amendment precedent, Kopel said.   

""Like so much else in constitutional law, the answer is ‘it depends,’ "" said Brannon P. Denning, a professor at Samford University’s Cumberland School of Law in Birmingham.

How do we rule?

A draft of the U.N. treaty would require the U.S. to report information on international arms sales only -- not domestic sales.  

But ""full-scale gun confiscation"" would not be constitutional. A domestic registry may not be.  

This means that even in the unlikely event that the U.N. creates a treaty that provides for domestic registries and the U.S. Senate ratifies it, it would not ""almost certainly force"" the U.S. to create one.

Broun’s statement contains the tiniest sliver of truth. The treaty would track international gun sales. But his claim makes it sound like the U.N. will keep a registry of all gun owners across the world. That’s a bizarre distortion of the facts",False,"August 10, 2012"
"""One of the key things about Leonard Lance is that in 2008, when you look at [the] Project Vote Smart website, he was not for guns. Now he has gone too far to the right, saying that you can carry concealed weapons in national parks.""","
U.S. Rep. Leonard Lance was elected to Congress, then took a hard right turn on his position on gun control, according to Upendra Chivukula, a Democratic state Assemblyman who hopes to unseat Lance in November. 
""One of the key things about Leonard Lance is that in 2008, when you look at [the] Project Vote Smart website, he was not for guns,"" Chivukula said in an Aug. 5 interview with the liberal blog Blue Jersey. ""Now he has gone too far to the right, saying that you can carry concealed weapons in national parks, which is mostly dangerous for the people who are visiting the national park.""

Lance, a former state senator, has faced criticism for shedding more moderate views since he was sworn in to the House of Representatives in 2009. So here, PolitiFact New Jersey wondered if Lance (R-7th Dist.) was ""not for guns"" in 2008 but then said, ""you can carry concealed weapons in national parks.""

The congressman’s position on the latter half of that claim is clear: he supports it. In May 2009, Lance voted to repeal the ban on visitors possessing firearms on federal public land, as long as gun owners comply with the laws of the state where the park is located.

Lance touts that vote on his campaign website in a section on Second Amendment rights.

But was Lance ""not for guns"" just a year prior to that vote, in 2008? That’s a broad, unsupported claim that suggests Lance opposed firearms and then reversed his position.

We found no evidence that Lance advocated against guns.

Joey Novick, Chivukula’s campaign manager, pointed us to a survey from Project Vote Smart, a nonpartisan group that tracks where candidates stand on key issues, to support Chivukula’s claim.

In 2007 -- as Lance was vying for another term in the New Jersey Senate -- he filled out the survey, which asks candidates to note which positions they would support in a number of areas if elected.

In a section labeled ""gun issues,"" Lance indicated he would ""maintain and strengthen the enforcement of existing state restrictions on the purchase and possession of guns."" He also noted his support to ""require a license for gun possession.""

But that doesn’t prove Lance was ""not for guns,"" only that he supported enforcing New Jersey’s current laws.  

Todd Mitchell, Lance’s chief of staff, said that Lance has always been a strong supporter of the Second Amendment, pointing to a number of ""pro-gun"" votes during his time as a state legislator. Also, Mitchell noted that in 2007 the state chapter of the NRA endorsed Lance’s re-election bid.

""This is a feeble attempt by the Chivukula campaign to distract voters from Upendra's dismal fiscal record as a member of the Democratic leadership in Trenton,"" Mitchell said.

Novick said Chivukula’s overall point was that in ""many issues––including guns and Second Amendment issues, Leonard Lance has moved to extreme positions that are more right wing.""

Our ruling

Chivukula said ""one of the key things about Leonard Lance is that in 2008, when you look at [the] Project Vote Smart website, he was not for guns. Now he has gone too far to the right, saying that you can carry concealed weapons in national parks.""

There’s an element of truth to this claim: Lance voted to repeal a ban on carrying weapons in national parks in 2009, as long as the gun owner complies with the laws of the state where the park is located.

But to suggest Lance flip-flopped in taking that position is misleading.

The survey Chivukula’s campaign cited shows Lance, as a state legislator, favored enforcing New Jersey’s current laws. To say Lance was ""not for guns"" is wrong",Mostly False,"August 9, 2012"
"""Guns have murdered more Americans here at home in recent years than have died on the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan.""","
War may be good for one thing: providing U.S. Sen. Frank Lautenberg with leverage for his argument that the United States needs stricter gun laws.

Lautenberg, who is pushing to reinstate a federal ban on high-capacity ammunition clips in the wake of the deadly mass shooting last month at a Colorado movie theater, said, ""our lax gun laws make it far too easy for murderers to commit acts of violence.""

""Here are the facts: Guns have murdered more Americans here at home in recent years than have died on the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan. In support of the two wars, more than 6,500 American soldiers have lost their lives. During the same period, however, guns have been used to murder about 100,000 people on American soil,"" Lautenberg said in a July 30 op-ed article posted on NorthJersey.com.

Lautenberg’s numbers are technically correct since 2001. In fact, he could have cited just a year of gun violence in the U.S. to make his point. But experts call his comparison flawed and misleading.

""More pickles are consumed in New York City than in Rhode Island. Is that a good comparison? I don’t think so. Because there are way more people in New York City,"" said Alan Lizotte, dean and professor at the school of criminal justice at The University at Albany.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation tracks murders in the United States through its Uniform Crime Report program. Caley Gray, a spokesman for Lautenberg, cited that source -- which shows more than 8,700 people were murdered in the United States with firearms in 2010 -- to support the senator’s statement.  

Since 2001 -- the year the war in Afghanistan began -- more than 95,000 people have been murdered with a gun in the United States, according to the FBI data.

Though those statistics do not include citizenship status, Gary Kleck, a professor of criminology at Florida State University, said ""my reaction is that you can safely assume that the vast majority of murder victims are U.S. citizens.""

That death toll is far higher than the number of U.S. military casualties from the nation’s recent wars.

More than 6,500 U.S. military personnel have died in conflicts from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan since 2001, according to data from the U.S. Department of Defense.

Gray said: ""The numbers speak for themselves. The bottom line and the sad truth is that far more Americans are being killed by guns in their own neighborhoods than in deadly war zones.""

But Kleck called the senator’s comparison ""foolish and misleading.""

""Taking account of the very different population sizes at risk, the risk of a gun homicide (or any kind of homicide) is enormously greater in Afghanistan than in the U.S.,"" Kleck said in an e-mail. ""Obviously even one homicide is one too many, but the hinted suggestion that the risk of death from a gun is even remotely as high in the U.S. as in Afghanistan is absurd.""

Lizotte also criticized Lautenberg’s statement for focusing only on the deaths of U.S. troops. ""Many more people were killed in Afghanistan and Iraq than Americans,"" he said.

For example, a July 2012 report from the Congressional Research Service noted that in Afghanistan ""11,864 civilians have been killed in the conflict since 2007, when the United Nations began reporting statistics, to the end of 2011.""

Our ruling

Lautenberg said, ""guns have murdered more Americans here at home in recent years than have died on the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan,"" claiming that ""more than 6,500 American soldiers"" died while ""guns have been used to murder about 100,000 people on American soil.""

Though Lautenberg’s numbers are mainly on target, three experts agreed that the senator’s statement is flawed largely because he uses raw numbers to compare two very different populations.

Also, Lautenberg focuses solely on deaths of U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, when many more have died in both wars",Half True,"August 6, 2012"
"Says under federal law ""we do not have any limitation on the number of guns and bullets we can buy.""","
In the days following a mass shooting at a Colorado movie theater, U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez and some of his fellow Democrats called for strengthening the nation’s gun control laws.

At a July 24 news conference in Washington, D.C., Menendez pointed out how, under federal law, ""we do not have any limitation on the number of guns and bullets we can buy.""

PolitiFact New Jersey is not weighing in on whether there should be such federal restrictions. We are only fact-checking Menendez’s claim that none exist. 
We found that the senator's right that there is no federal law limiting the number of guns and bullets one can purchase at a given time. Three states, including New Jersey, have enacted their own restrictions on handgun sales. 
A spokesman for the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and gun policy experts confirmed that the senator’s claim is accurate.

""It is correct that there are no limits in federal law to the amount of guns or ammunition a person can buy if he/she is not a proscribed possessor of firearms,"" said Daniel Webster, co-director of the Center for Gun Policy and Research at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.

Federal law prohibits certain individuals from getting a gun or ammunition, such as someone convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence. Also, there are certain reporting requirements under federal law for multiple gun sales.

For instance, licensed dealers must report to federal authorities if they sell more than one handgun to the same person within five consecutive business days. Also, licensed dealers in Arizona, California, New Mexico and Texas must report multiple sales of certain rifles during the same time period.

Referring to such federal reporting requirements, Jon Vernick, co-director of the Center for Gun Policy and Research, added in an e-mail: ""However, this form simply acts as a record of, not a limitation on, multiple purchases.""

The vast majority of states don’t limit the number of firearms that can be purchased, according to a state-by-state breakdown compiled by the California-based Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.

New Jersey is one of three states that prohibit the sale of more than one handgun to an individual within a 30-day period, along with California and Maryland, according to the center. Each of those state laws allow for certain exemptions. Virginia repealed a similar law earlier this year.

""The Senator was (and will continue) to talk about the need for federal laws that limit the number of bullets and the number of firearms a person can purchase,"" Menendez spokeswoman Tricia Enright said in an e-mail. ""He believes we need stronger laws nationally, not a patchwork of laws that vary in terms of strength state by state.""

Following the mass shooting at a movie theater in Colorado, Menendez claimed at a news conference that ""we do not have any limitation on the number of guns and bullets we can buy.""

PolitiFact National recently dug into a similar statement that had been posted on Facebook: ""Nearly 100,000 people get shot every year. That's 270 people a day and 87 dead.""

That claim landed at Mostly True on the Truth-O-Meter because the numbers were largely right but needed additional context. Saying ""nearly 100,000 people get shot every year"" suggests a person is being shot by someone else, but self-inflicted injuries represent a significant portion of that figure.

Holt’s statement takes the Facebook post a step further by tying the gun deaths statistic in with comments about the Colorado shooting, strengthening the impression that the number he cites represents Americans killed by a gun in the hands of someone other than themselves.

When suicides are removed from the count, the number of individuals killed by guns each day drops off steeply, we found.

The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tracks the causes of fatalities for residents of the United States. In 2009 -- the most recent data available -- 31,347 people died in firearm-related incidents.

Suicides represent nearly 60 percent (18,735) of those gun-related deaths, while homicides make up nearly 37 percent (11,493). The rest of the fatalities fall into three categories:  unintentional (554), undetermined (232) or legal intervention/war (333).

Overall, about 86 people die daily across the nation in firearm-related incidents. That figure drops to roughly 35 people a day when suicides are eliminated from the count. About 32 people die daily in homicides.

We asked Thomas Seay, the congressman’s spokesman, to explain why Holt used a statistic increased significantly by suicides to make a point about gun safety legislation after a mass shooting.

Seay said in an e-mail that ""you’re right to point out that gun deaths take many different forms. Gunfire kills people in mass shootings, as in the evil acts in Colorado. Gunfire kills people in isolated murders. Gunfire kills people in accidents. And in many cases, people use gunfire to kill themselves. Almost all of these deaths are tragic and the cause of family grieving, so as we grieve with the families of Aurora, there are many other families whom we should not forget.""

The questions of what to do about potential future deaths and injury should be confronted, examined, and answered, but we should start with an understanding of the problem: more than 80 deaths by gunfire each day.""

Our ruling

Holt said, ""As we watch the news from Colorado with horror and sympathy for the families, we should remember that each day more than 80 Americans are killed by gunfire, unnecessary tragedies.""

It’s true that more than 80 people died daily in firearm-related incidents, according to the most recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Suicides represent a significant majority of that figure and that’s an important detail Holt’s statement lacks. While commenting on a mass shooting, he cites a statistic inflated by individuals who took their own lives. Saying more than 80 Americans are ""killed by gunfire"" each day in this context suggests those victims were shot by somebody else, not themselves.

Still, it is true that guns are involved in more than 80 deaths a day nationwide",Half True,"July 27, 2012"
"""There's a loophole where you can sell guns without a background check … 40 percent of guns are sold that way"" at gun shows and over the Internet.","
Editor’s note: We first fact-checked this statement on July 25, 2012, and rated it Mostly True. After the shooting in Newtown, Conn., on Dec. 14, 2012, other people repeated this statistic, and new criticism of the 40 percent figure emerged. At the request of readers, we looked at the statement again, did additional reporting, and changed our rating to Half True on Jan. 30, 2013. The original item is archived here; the fact-check below reflects our additional reporting and new rating.

As the nation absorbed the news about the shooting deaths in a Colorado movie theater, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg was scathing in his criticism of the National Rifle Association. On CBS’ Face the Nation in July 2012, Bloomberg accused the NRA of being ""adamant about no controls on weapons.""
   
He said the pro-gun group leans on Congress and the White House and blocks funding for officials to enforce laws to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and the mentally unstable.
   
""We don't need more laws. We need a couple of fixes,"" Bloomberg said. ""There's a loophole where you can sell guns without a background check at a gun show, 40 percent of guns are sold that way, same thing on the Internet. … The NRA has opposed anything.""

Here, we will check Bloomberg’s statement that ""you can sell guns without a background check at a gun show, forty percent of guns are sold that way, same thing on the Internet."" His phrasing is a little awkward, but his staff told us he meant that 40 percent of guns are sold without a background check, either at gun shows or on the Internet.
   
Current law
   
Buying a gun has required a background check since the Brady Act took effect in 1994. (James Brady was badly wounded during the 1981 assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan; he was Reagan’s press secretary.) Under the law, federally licensed dealers must verify that a buyer has not been convicted of a serious crime or declared mentally incompetent or is blocked for any of about 10 reasons. Typically this is done online and takes less than a day.
   
But only licensed dealers must do this. The law doesn’t apply to private sellers at gun shows, flea markets, or people who post firearms for sale on the Internet. If a private seller suspects that a buyer would be disqualified under federal rules, then they can’t go through with the sale. But there is no background check, and no one needs to file any paperwork.
   
Bloomberg’s office pointed us to a 1997 study by the National Institute of Justice on who owns guns and how they use them.The researchers estimated that about 40 percent of all firearm sales took place through people other than licensed dealers. They based their conclusion on data from a 1994 survey of more than 2,500 households. But it’s important to note that of the 2,568 households surveyed, only 251 people answered the question about the origin of their gun.

We asked Philip Cook, a Duke University professor who co-authored the study, if he thinks that 40 percent estimate -- which is now more than 15 years old -- is still a current, reliable estimate of secondary market gun sales.
   
""The answer is I have no idea,"" Cook said. ""This survey was done almost 20 years ago. … It’s clear there are a lot of transactions that are not through dealers. How many, we’re not really clear on it. … We would say it’s a very old number.""

Other scholars had similar views. Paul Blackman is a retired criminologist and former research coordinator for the NRA Institute for Legislative Action. ""Personally, I think your safest bet is to say that no one knows, but that the vast majority of crime guns come from some other source than gun shows,"" he told us.

On the other hand, not much has changed in the gun market in the past two decades.

""It’s a fairly stable market. That is to say, gun stores have had their part, police supply stores have had their part, and then there are the gun shows and private dealings about which we know very little,"" said Robert McCrie, of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. ""There’s the knowledge that the market has been more vigorous and probably that higher vigor has been reflected in gun shows and private sales in tandem.""
   
McCrie said, ""The 40 percent seems about right.""
   
Gary Kleck, whose research has provided the foundation for less restrictive concealed carry laws, told PolitiFact the 40 percent estimate is ""probably still reasonably valid today.""

Little other evidence
   
In 1999, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives released a report on gun shows. Investigators found that a quarter of the vendors were private sellers, not licensed dealers, and reported that ""felons and other prohibited persons who want to avoid Brady Act checks and records of their purchase buy firearms at these shows."" They said guns from such shows had been used in drug crimes.
   
We called the ATF and asked if there was anything more recent. They had nothing new to add. We called the National Rifle Association and the National Shooting Sports Foundation, groups that oppose new efforts to track gun transactions. Neither organization responded.
   
The City of New York commissioned an investigation of Internet gun sales in 2011. The report said on 10 websites, it found over 25,000 weapons for sale.The report said that over 60 percent of sellers allowed a purchase to move forward even when the alleged buyer said he didn’t believe he would pass a background check.

Our ruling
   
Bloomberg said 40 percent of gun sales take place through gun shows or the Internet, without a background check.
   
The best information on the informal gun market is based on a survey and is about 15 years old (the data used in the survey is almost 20 years old). There’s no question that many guns are bought with no background check, but there’s not sufficient current evidence to say that the proportion is 40 percent of all sales",Half True,"July 25, 2012"
"""USA is #1 in gun violence.""","In the wake of the mass shooting in Aurora, Colo., Americans took to social media to express their views on guns and violence.
   
A reader sent us one Facebook post about the extent of gun violence in the United States. It said, ""USA is #1 in gun violence. Nearly 100,000 people get shot every year. That's 270 people a day and 87 dead because of gun violence every day.""
   
In this item, we’ll look at the first part of that claim -- that the ""USA is #1 in gun violence.""

International comparisons are always tricky, because there are differences from country to country in the definitions being used as well as the reliability and timeliness of the data. The most comprehensive international comparisons we found were published by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. Because of limited comparable data, we are defining gun violence as gun homicides. Let’s look at a few statistics:

Annual homicides from firearms

According to the U.N. figures, the U.S. had 9,146 homicides by firearm in 2009. That year, Colombia and Venezuela both exceeded the U.S. total, with 12,808 and 11,115 firearm deaths, respectively. Three other nations topped the U.S. amount in the most recent year for which data is available: Brazil (34,678 in 2008), Mexico (11,309 in 2010) and Thailand (20,032 in 2000).

So the U.S. ranks high in this category, but not first. Even using the higher U.S. homicide figure of 11,493 in 2010 from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (cited here), the U.S. still doesn’t rank first internationally.

Annual homicide rate for firearms

Because the U.S. is so big, it's better to compare the frequency of firearm homicides per capita, usually expressed as firearm homicides per 100,000 in national population.

According to the U.N., the U.S. had 3.0 firearm homicides per 100,000 in population in 2009. But there were 14 other nations that had higher rates in 2009, primarily in Latin America and the Caribbean: Honduras (57.6), Jamaica (47.2), St. Kitts and Nevis (44.4), Venezuela (39.0), Guatemala (38.5), Colombia (28.1), Trinidad & Tobago (27.3), Panama (19.3), Dominican Republic (16.9), Bahamas (15.4), Belize (15.4), Mexico (7.9), Paraguay (7.3) and Nicaragua (5.9). Three other nations had higher rates in 2008: El Salvador (39.9), Brazil (18.1) and Ecuador (12.7).

So the U.S. doesn’t rank no. 1 when firearm homicides are adjusted for population.

Where the U.S. does rank high in firearm violence

The main area where the U.S. exceeds the firearm violence of other nations is in comparison to other affluent nations. Using the U.N. data, European nations -- even former eastern bloc countries -- typically have rates well below 1 per 100,000, or far less than one-third the frequency seen in the U.S. The pattern is similar in other advanced industrialized nations, such as Canada, Taiwan, Japan, Australia and New Zealand.

One study published in 2011 confirms this finding. The study, published in the Journal of Trauma -- Injury Infection & Critical Care, found that firearm homicide rates were 19.5 times higher in the U.S. than in 23 other ""high income"" countries studied, using 2003 data. Rates for other types of gun deaths were also higher in the U.S., but by somewhat smaller margins: 5.8 times higher for firearm suicides (even though overall suicide rates were 30 percent lower in the U.S.) and 5.2 times higher for unintentional firearm deaths.

Our ruling

The Facebook post says the ""USA is #1 in gun violence."" That's only true if you compare the U.S. with other affluent nations on a per capita basis. But widening the comparison to all nations, not just the richest ones, there are at least 17 other countries with higher per capita rates of gun homicides, most of them with rates astronomically higher than the U.S. rate.

And measured by raw gun homicides, the U.S. doesn’t rank first -- at least two and possibly as many as five countries have had more gun homicides in recent years than the U.S. did",Half True,"July 23, 2012"
"""Nearly 100,000 people get shot every year. That's 270 people a day and 87 dead.""","
In the wake of the mass shooting in Aurora, Colo., Americans took to social media to express their views on guns and violence.

A reader sent us one Facebook post about the extent of gun violence in the United States. It said, ""USA is #1 in gun violence. Nearly 100,000 people get shot every year. That's 270 people a day and 87 dead because of gun violence every day.""

In this item, we’ll look at the second half of that claim: ""Nearly 100,000 people get shot every year. That's 270 people a day and 87 dead.""

The numbers

We turned to statistics from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; experts in the field told us it keeps the most reliable statistics on the subject. The CDC collects two sets of relevant data.

The first is data for deaths by guns, which is included in an annual report about deaths of all types during calendar year 2009. The numbers for gun deaths is broken down into several categories:

Suicide: 18,735 deaths
Homicide: 11,493 deaths
Unintentional: 554 deaths
Legal interventions: 333 deaths
Undetermined: 232 deaths

Total: 31,347 deaths

The second data set tracks non-fatal injuries by guns. According to the CDC, there were 73,505 non-fatal firearm injuries in 2010. (We will ignore an additional 13,851 non-fatal injuries from BB or pellet guns.)

How accurate is the Facebook post?

If you add together the gun deaths and the non-fatal gun injuries, you get 104,852 people shot every year. That’s very close to what the Facebook post said. The Facebook post was also close in its daily averages -- 287 people shot every day, and 86 deaths by gun every day.

There’s one area, however, in which the Facebook post could have benefited from additional context. It says that ""nearly 100,000 people get shot every year,"" which to us suggests that a victim is being shot by someone else. In reality, a significant majority of gun deaths comes from self-inflicted firearm wounds.

If you ignore the suicides -- and if you assume that relatively few people survive a suicide attempt with a firearm (we couldn’t find any hard data on that question) -- then the number of people who got shot, either fatally or non-fatally, was about 86,000, or roughly 235 a day. That’s lower than the Facebook post indicated. And the daily number of firearm deaths would be substantially lower -- 35 per day, rather than the 87 cited in the Facebook post.

Our ruling

The numbers in the Facebook post are close to accurate, as long as you make one major assumption -- that suicides count as ""get(ting) shot."" We think that assumption is debatable, but there is no question that at least 100,000 people did die or become injured from firearms",Mostly True,"July 23, 2012"
"Barack Obama has ""provided guns to Mexican drug cartels.""","
Addressing the Republican Party of Texas convention, Gov. Rick Perry said the country erred in 2008 by electing the wrong person as president.

""Three and a half years, and nearly 100 rounds of golf into his presidency, Barack Obama has exploded the federal debt, passed a failed, budget-busting stimulus package, socialized health care, and provided guns to Mexican drug cartels,"" Perry said June 7, 2012. ""Admit it, America -- 2008 was our national ‘oops’  moment!""

We recently confirmed Obama had played nearly 100 rounds of golf as president. And PolitiFact reporters have previously explored claims about the debt, the success of the stimulus package and whether the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Health Care Act amounts to socialized health care.

Perry’s claim that Obama ""provided guns to Mexican drug cartels"" struck us as novel. Is it correct?

Perry spokeswoman Catherine Frazier told us by email that Perry was referring to the botched federal gun trafficking investigation on the U.S.-Mexico border known as Fast and Furious in which federal agents lost track of hundreds of firearms they were letting flow into Mexico from Arizona as part of an effort to build cases against Mexican drug cartels.

The multi-agency federal arms-trafficking investigation took place from late 2009 to early 2011 -- during Obama’s presidency -- under the Phoenix office of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, an agency of the Justice Department.

In the operation, agents purposely allowed weapons to be illegally purchased and circulated on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border, as the Los Angeles Times said in a Dec. 8, 2011, news story. Two of the weapons turned up after a U.S. Border Patrol agent was killed in southern Arizona, the paper said, though for a January 2012 fact check, we found no information supporting a claim that ballistics tests confirmed that the found weapons killed the agent.

The Times said scores of other guns in the operation were reportedly used in violent crimes in Mexico, adding: ""While the aim of Fast and Furious was to track weapons, instead it ended up significantly arming the Mexican drug cartels.""

And did Obama have a hand in the endeavor? We looked for indications.

In a March 22, 2011, interview with Univision, posted online by CBS News, Obama said neither he nor Attorney General Eric Holder authorized Fast and Furious and pointed out that the operation was under internal investigation. ""We don’t have all the facts,"" Obama said.

Asked if he was informed about the operation, Obama replied: ""Absolutely not. This is a pretty big government, the United States government. I’ve got a lot of moving parts."" He added: ""Our policy is to ramp up the interdiction"" or capture ""of guns flowing south, because that’s contributing to some of the security problems that are taking place in Mexico.""

In an interview the same day with CNN Español and an October 2011 interview with ABC News, Obama said he learned of Fast and Furious from news reports. He further said to CNN: ""We have to make sure that we are interdicting the flow of guns and cash to the south. It's not enough just to interdict drugs flowing north. And so, we've actually initiated a whole range of measures to make sure that we're reducing that southbound flow.""

Noting that Holder had launched the internal investigation into Fast and Furious, Obama told ABC ""it is not acceptable for us to allow guns to go into Mexico... So it's very upsetting to me to think that somebody showed such bad judgment that they would allow something like that to happen and we will find out who and what happened in this situation and make sure it gets corrected.""

We looked for other signs of Obama’s role in the operation, finding nothing to contradict his accounts.

In 2011, staff to the House Committee on Oversight & Government Reform, chaired by Rep. Darrell Issa, R-California, issued two Fast and Furious reports. The June 14, 2011, report covers Fast and Furious accounts of ATF agents. The July 26, 2011, report explores the impact of Fast and Furious on Mexico. The reports do not gauge Obama’s involvement.

A January 2012 report by House Democrats says the strategy of permitting illegal guns to flow to cartels in Mexico in hopes of building cases against vital figures originated with federal law officers in Arizona in 2006, which was when George W. Bush was president.

""Unfortunately, this strategy failed to include sufficient operational controls to stop these dangerous weapons from getting into the hands of violent criminals, creating a danger to public safety on both sides of the border,"" Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Maryland, told colleagues in a Jan. 30, 2012, letter summarizing the report. His letter says Fast and Furious was the fourth federal operation since 2006 in which gun-walking occurred.

Finally, we reached the office of Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, who has been critical of Fast and Furious. Grassley spokeswoman Jill Gerber provided a partially redacted document that appears to be a Jan. 8, 2010, briefing paper on Fast and Furious originated by federal authorities based in Arizona. Its bullet point No. 13 opens: ""Currently our strategy is to allow the transfer of firearms to continue to take place, albeit at a much slower pace, in order to further the investigation and allow for the identification of additional co-conspirators who would continue to operate and illegally traffic"" firearms to Mexican drug trafficking organizations ""perpetrating armed violence along the Southwest Border.""

Informed of Perry’s statement, Gerber said by email: ""It’s more accurate and complete to say the ‘Obama administration’ provided guns to Mexican drug cartels rather than"" to ""say President Obama himself did so.""

Our ruling

Fast and Furious, intended to send guns to Mexican drug cartels toward building cases against key figures, took place on Obama’s watch. However, unlike the other results bemoaned by Perry at the convention -- growth in the federal debt and the passage of Obamacare and the stimulus -- we see no indication Obama had an influential role in the border operation. That is, there is no sign that Obama either initiated or approved the deliberate flow of guns to cartels",Half True,"June 18, 2012"
"Says Barack ""Obama admits he’s coming for our guns, telling Sarah Brady, ‘We are working on (gun control), but under the radar.’ ""","
President Barack Obama has shown little interest in peddling a gun control agenda during his first term, but the National Rifle Association is urging its members not to let its guard down ahead of the 2012 election.

In a new mailer, forwarded to us by a reader, the gun rights group lists ""Ten Reasons Why Obama is Bad for the Second Amendment."" We’ve been exploring several claims on the list this week -- you can see our findings here.

A crucial point to the don’t-sleep-on-Obama thinking comes in as reason No. 10 on the NRA list: ""Obama admits he’s coming for our guns, telling Sarah Brady, ‘We are working on (gun control), but under the radar.’""

The quote and the claim struck us as interesting because 1.) It’s typically not smart to say you’re doing something ""under the radar,"" if you’re actually doing something under the radar, and 2.) It suggests something of a conspiracy because Sarah Brady is a prominent gun control advocate, having helped create the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence with her husband Jim. (We’re assuming you know the Brady story, but if you don’t -- this will help.)

We decided to check it out.

While the NRA didn’t respond to our questions about the claim, we found the genesis of the Obama quote easy enough.

It comes from a 2011 Washington Post profile of White House gun policy adviser Steve Croley. It’s not a direct quote from Obama, rather it’s Brady recalling to Post reporter Jason Horowitz her meeting with Obama on March 30, 2011, the 30th anniversary of the assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan.

Here’s what Horowitz wrote:

During the meeting, President Obama dropped in and, according to Sarah Brady, brought up the issue of gun control, ""to fill us in that it was very much on his agenda,"" she said.

""I just want you to know that we are working on it,"" Brady recalled the president telling them. ""We have to go through a few processes, but under the radar.""

In the meeting, she said, Obama discussed how records get into the system and what can be done about firearms retailers. Her husband specifically brought up the proposed ban on large magazine clips, and she noted that even former Vice President Dick Cheney had suggested that some restrictions on the clips might make sense.

""He just laughed,"" Sarah Brady said approvingly of the president. Both she and her husband, she emphasized, had absolute confidence that the president was committed to regulation.

The rest of the Post article focuses on how Democrats and the Obama administration have largely ignored gun control issues, how Obama has failed to deliver on a promise to eliminate an amendment requiring the FBI to destroy records of gun buyers’ background checks, and how Obama chose to avoid a debate over gun issues in the weeks and months after the shooting of Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords.

We contacted Post reporter Jason Horowitz, who declined to comment.

To recap: The Washington Post reported that Sarah Brady said Obama told her his administration is ""working on it,"" likely referring to gun control (in what way is unclear in the article). And Brady then tells the Post Obama said, ""We have to go through a few processes, but under the radar.""

The quote then gets distorted by the NRA to ""Obama admits he’s coming for our guns, telling Sarah Brady, ‘We are working on (gun control), but under the radar.’""

Although the wording leaves plenty of room for interpretation, it's not accurate to summarize that quote by saying  ""Obama admits he’s coming for our guns"" because the specifics of Obama’s comment -- as relayed by Brady -- are unknown.

We contacted Brady, who told us her quote has been misinterpreted and that she herself never spoke with Obama about gun policy.

""I so remember (Jason) Horowitz -- he was at the press get-together in the briefing room after our meeting. (Her husband) Jim was asked lots of questions -- then (Horowitz) followed me as we walked out of the briefing room until he got back into the main part of the West Wing. He kept trying to pin me down -- asking what I thought -- I was trying to be evasive as I didn't want to paint Obama as with us or against us -- as we hadn't really talked about it. If I remember correctly, I just kept shaking my head and trying to get away from him. What ever I might have said or agreed to was purely speculative as I never spoke to the president myself about this issue.""

We also spoke with one of the few other people in the room during the meeting between the Bradys and Obama -- Paul Helmke, the former president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence.

Helmke told us he did not recall Obama making any specific promises on gun issues, and that if Obama was talking about anything, it was likely a proposal to require gun shops in border states to report purchases of two or more of semi-automatic rifles if they were made within a five-day window by the same person.

The federal proposal was first considered in December 2010, and went through a lengthy public comment process during the first six months of 2011. The rule was implemented in July, though it is being challenged in court by the National Shooting Sports Foundation.

Helmke said the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence had been discussing the proposal to better track multiple sales of semi-automatic rifles with the Department of Justice before meeting with the president.

""I don't think (Obama) should be seen as referencing anything more than just requiring border-area gun dealers to report multiple sales of long guns,"" Helmke said.

If that context is correct, Obama’s statements fall far short of what the NRA claims, namely that Obama is ""coming for our guns.""

But even if Helmke is wrong, the NRA -- which did not respond to us -- has produced no evidence that the president is crafting a plot to take away firearms. Not through his policies. Or his words.

On top of that, the context of the quote is being challenged by the person who gave it -- Brady.

Our ruling

In a mailer, the National Rifle Association says that  ""Obama admits he’s coming for our guns, telling Sarah Brady, ‘We are working on (gun control), but under the radar.’ ""

We found no evidence of an Obama admission anything like the NRA suggests. 
What happened is Brady gave an interview to the Washington Post, where she recalled what the president said to her during a private meeting. 
But the NRA makes a tremendous leap by concluding that the quote shows that ""Obama admits he's coming for our guns."" A person at the meeting said Obama was likely referring to an in-the-works program to get gun dealers in border states to forward some gun purchases to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Brady says she never talked to Obama about gun policy.

The NRA has taken a fragment of an unclear quote and prescribed the most far-reaching, conspiratorial conclusion. There simply isn't enough evidence for such a sweeping claim",False Pants on Fire,"June 14, 2012"
"Says Barack Obama is ""trying to slash funding for the Armed Pilots Program designed to prevent terror attacks.""","
The National Rifle Association is out with a Top 10-style list detailing why President Barack Obama is anti-gun. We’re investigating several of the claims on the list. You can see all our fact-checks by clicking back here throughout the week.

Today, we tackle the No. 6 reason why President Barack Obama is bad news for the Second Amendment: ""Obama is trying to slash funding for the Armed Pilots Program designed to prevent terror attacks.""

(For the record, the NRA list doesn’t rank one reason as being worse than another, so the fact that this claim is No. 6 doesn’t mean it's more serious than, say, No. 10, ""Obama admits he's coming for our guns ..."")

The ""Armed Pilots Program"" is officially called the Federal Flight Deck Officer Program, which was created after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. It’s pretty much what it sounds like.

The federal government has budgeted $25 million a year to deputize and train volunteer commercial pilots to carry firearms on commercial flights. The federal government has not said how many pilots take part.

In the FY 2013 budget, Obama proposed to cut the program’s funding roughly in half, to $12 million.

Here’s how the administration explained the cut in its budget request:

""The Administration proposes to reduce funding for the FFDO program (i.e., deputized, armed pilots) in 2013. As the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) focuses its aviation security activities on programs that mitigate the highest amount of risk at the lowest cost, the Budget has prioritized funding in the same manner. The voluntary FFDO program was created as a ‘last defense’ layer of security at a time when comprehensive aviation screening and other physical security measures were not fully developed or deployed on a system-wide basis. Since 2001, however, there have been a number of enhancements to aviation security. TSA now conducts 100 percent screening of all passengers and their carryon items, has overseen installation of reinforced and locking cockpit doors on aircraft that operate in U.S. airspace, and has increased passenger and flight crew awareness to address security risks. Combined, these improvements have greatly lowered the chances of unauthorized cockpit access and represent a comprehensive and redundant risk-mitigation strategy that begins well before passengers board the aircraft.""

In short, the Obama administration said that arming pilots isn’t as important as it use to be, given other security improvements.

Transportation Security Administrator John Pistole also said that the agency has had trouble coordinating schedules of armed pilots, whose flights are set by the airlines, with those of U.S. air marshals managed by the TSA, according to Bloomberg. ""In an ideal world, one without budget constraints, we would fully fund the program. We’re not in that environment, so we are taking reductions,"" he said.

The Republican-led House disagreed.

On June 6, 2012, the House voted not only to reverse Obama’s proposed cuts but to increase the program’s budget to $35 million.

""9/11 woke us up to the reality that we live in a dangerous world. With varied and ever-emerging threats, every effort should be made to make air travel as safe as possible,"" said Rep. Chip Cravaack, R-Minn., who sponsored the amendment. (Cravaack is a former Northwest Airlines pilot who says he was in the Armed Pilots Program.)

Lastly we checked with Brian Darling, a senior fellow for government studies at the conservative Heritage Foundation who has been following the issue. Darling noted that the Armed Pilots Program had been funded at the same level since its inception, and that Obama’s decision to cut the program in half seems more like a policy choice than something prompted by budget constraints.

Still, the savings are relatively small. The $12 million-$13 million in potential savings comprises about 0.15 percent of the entire TSA $7.6 billion proposed budget.

Our ruling

The NRA claimed that Obama is ""trying to slash funding for the Armed Pilots Program designed to prevent terror attacks.""

The Armed Pilots Program was created post-Sept. 11, 2001, to serve as a last-line of defense in a terror attack. And Obama, in his FY 2013 budget proposal, did propose cutting the budget for the program in half.

Obama says the program isn’t as critical as it once was. But that doesn’t contradict the NRA’s claim",True,"June 14, 2012"
"Says Barack Obama’s regulatory adviser Cass Sunstein, ""wants to ban hunting and says animals should be represented in court.""","
We have to admit: We don’t know a whole lot about Cass Sunstein, Barack Obama’s regulatory adviser, other than he’s become kind of a whipping boy for conservative causes.

The latest example comes from the National Rifle Association. The NRA is singling out the Obama aide in a flier explaining why the president is bad for the Second Amendment.

We’re checking several claims from the NRA’s mailer, titled ""Ten Reasons Why Obama is Bad News for the Second Amendment."" You can see all our fact-checks by clicking back here throughout the week.

The attack leveled against Sunstein -- administrator of the White House’s Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs --  is that he ""wants to ban hunting and says animals should be represented in court.""

We’ve heard part of this claim before, from NRA executive vice president Wayne LaPierre, who used Sunstein to paint the Obama administration as out of touch back in 2009.

""Sunstein is a radical animal rights extremist who makes PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) look like cheerleaders with pooper-scoopers,"" LaPierre said.

How extreme? LaPierre said Sunstein is ""a man who wants to give legal standing to animals so they can sue you for eating meat.""

That’s basically the second half of the claim in the mailer -- though the mailer’s tone is tamped down a bit.

The evidence comes from Sunstein's 2004 book Animal Rights: Current Debates and New Directions. Chapter 11 is titled ""Can Animals Sue?""

""My simplest suggestion is that private citizens should be given the right to bring suits to prevent animals from being treated in a way that violates current law,"" Sunstein writes. ""I offer a recommendation that is theoretically modest but that should do a lot of practical good: laws designed to protect animals against cruelty and abuse should be amended and interpreted to give a private cause of action against those who violate them, so as to allow private people to supplement the efforts of public prosecutors. Somewhat more broadly, I will suggest that animals should be permitted to bring suit, with human beings as their representatives, to prevent violations of current law.""

Sunstein argues that abused animals should be able to be represented in courts by humans. That’s a little more nuanced than the NRA mailer lets on, but the mailer basically gets the point correct.

As for the other part of the NRA mailer -- than Sunstein wants to ban hunting -- that comes from remarks Sunstein delivered at Harvard University in 2007. In his speech, Sunstein repeats the idea that human beings ought to be able to act on the behalf of abused animals in the court system.

He then discusses ways to close gaps in current anti-animal cruelty laws and notes that hunters are almost always excluded from animal cruelty laws (here’s unedited video of Sunstein’s remarks; he begins speaking about 40 minutes in).

""We ought to ban hunting, I suggest, if there isn't a purpose other than sport or fun. That should be against the law. It’s time now,"" Sunstein says.

We listened to huge portions of the video around Sunstein’s ""ban hunting"" remarks. It’s clear Sunstein is attempting to be provocative, and he notes that some of proposals could be hard to accept. Still, that's what he said.

Republican senators were concerned enough by Sunstein’s statements on both the rights of animals in court and banning hunting to initially put a hold on his 2009 nomination.

That forced Sunstein to address his statements, first privately in a meeting with Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., and then in a July 14, 2009, letter.

On hunting, Sunstein wrote: ""I strongly believe that the Second Amendment creates an individual right to possess and use guns for purposes of both hunting and self-defense … If confirmed, I would respect the Second Amendment and the individual right that it recognizes.""

On the ability of animals to be represented in court: ""Let me be very clear: If confirmed, I would not take any steps to promote litigation on behalf of animals. In particular, federal law does not create an individual right to bring lawsuits, on behalf of animals, against agriculture. I do not favor and would not promote such a right.""

Sunstein was confirmed by the Senate 57-40 on Sept. 10, 2009. 
We reached out to the NRA but did not hear back.

Our ruling

For the most part, the NRA accurately summarizes Sunstein’s position in his 2004 book and his 2007 speech at Harvard. But the group ignores the most recent statements Sunstein made on both issues as part of his 2009 confirmation.

Sunstein said he would respect people’s right to hunt -- though that doesn’t mean he still doesn’t want to ban the practice. His about-face was more evident when it comes to the right of an individual to sue on behalf of animal. Contradicting his earlier statements, he said he does not favor changing federal law.

"Says Barack Obama ""supported Ted Kennedy’s ammo ban to outlaw all deer-hunting ammunition.""","
Never mind that President Barack Obama has done little on gun issues -- so little, in fact, that gun control advocates are unhappy. The National Rifle Association continues to portray him as a relentless threat to the Second Amendment who wants to take your guns away.

The NRA has a website called ""Gun Ban Obama"" that warns he ""would be the most anti-gun president in American history.""  One article is headlined ""Hillary was right: You can't trust Obama with your guns.""

In the mail comes a flier that offers ""10 reasons why Obama is bad news for the Second Amendment.""

This week, we plan to focus on several of those top 10 reasons as part of an effort to triangulate Obama’s positions on guns and whether the NRA attacks are accurate.

Here we’ll examine what the NRA listed as reason No. 2 -- ""Obama supported Ted Kennedy’s ammo ban to outlaw all deer-hunting ammunition.""

It's an oldie, but a goodie. The NRA used the same general attack against John Kerry in 2004 and against Obama in 2008.

The attack against Obama is rooted in a vote he took while serving in the U.S. Senate. It has to do with what the federal government considers armor-piercing ammunition (not, as the statement says, ammo for deer hunting).

The sale, manufacture or import of armor-piercing ammunition in handguns was banned by Congress and President Ronald Reagan in 1986. The measure, which applied only to civilians and did not outlaw the use or possession of armor-piercing rounds, passed the House 400-21 and the Senate 97-1.

As part of the 1986 law, Congress defined armor-piercing ammunition as:
  
(i) a projectile or projectile core which may be used in a handgun and which is constructed entirely (excluding the presence of traces of other substances) from one or a combination of tungsten alloys, steel, iron, brass, bronze, beryllium copper, or depleted uranium; or 
(ii) a full jacketed projectile larger than .22 caliber designed and intended for use in a handgun and whose jacket has a weight of more than 25 percent of the total weight of the projectile. 

In 2005 -- as he had in years past --  former Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy offered an amendment to a gun bill that would have broadened the definition of armor-piercing ammunition -- moving away from specific metals and weights to include ammunition capable of penetrating body armor.

Specifically, Kennedy proposed to add:
  
(iii) a projectile that may be used in a handgun and that the Attorney General determines, under section 926(d), to be capable of penetrating body armor; or 
(iv) a projectile for a center-fire rifle, designed or marketed as having armor piercing capability, that the Attorney General determines, under section 926(d), to be more likely to penetrate body armor than standard ammunition of the same caliber.''. 

Kennedy’s amendment was defeated 64-31. Obama voted in favor of the amendment.

To be clear, Kennedy wasn’t proposing to outlaw deer-hunting ammunition (and so it’s even a bigger stretch to say Obama supported it). Kennedy’s amendment changed the definition of what is considered armor-piercing ammunition. It had nothing to do with deer hunting.

It’s the NRA that interpreted the deer-hunting connection. The gun rights group did not respond to us for this fact-check, but the group previously explained its thinking to FactCheck.org during the 2008 campaign. Specifically, the NRA said it was worried about Kennedy’s (iii) definition of armor piercing, because:

1.) There are a few (uncommon) models of handguns that can shoot rifle rounds, and;
2.) Most rifle rounds are considered armor piercing.

Therefore, the NRA concluded, the government can ban the rifle rounds used to hunt deer.

That reasoning ignores the latitude the amendment gives to the attorney general and Kennedy’s own words when asked about the intent of the change. ""This is not about hunting. We know duck and geese and deer do not wear armor vests; police officers do,"" Kennedy said during debate about the amendment.

Still, David B. Kopel, research director of the Independence Institute, a libertarian-leaning group that generally opposes government regulation, says Kennedy’s bill language is broad enough to allow for the banning of almost any ammunition and that his intent may be irrelevant. (Kopel’s writings have appeared on the NRA website.)

""Sen. Kennedy, the sponsor of the bill, said that he did not want to ban hunting ammunition,"" Kopel said. ""Nevertheless, the plain language of the bill, and not Sen. Kennedy’s floor statements, were what would be enacted into law. If there were ever a judicial challenge to ban particular rifle ammunition, a court might well find that the language of the statute, along with judicial deference to agency interpretation of the statute, meant there was no need to look to legislative history.""

William Vizzard, a criminal justice professor at California State University-Sacramento and a former Alcohol, Tobacco & Firearms agent, sees this differently.

While it’s true that almost all rifle ammunition will penetrate body armor worn by police, ""it is absolutely ludicrous to believe that a Democratic administration would have risked the political fallout of trying to use this section to prohibit rifle ammunition.

""The Democrats have avoided all gun control controversies assiduously,"" Vizzard said, adding that the attempts to ban armor piercing ammunition is ""as phoney as the typical NRA issue.""

""This is an example of both sides pushing symbolism over substance,"" he said.

There are other problems with the NRA claim.

In its 2008 attack, the NRA -- using the same evidence -- claimed Obama wanted to  ""ban virtually all deer hunting ammunition,"" arguing that ""many"" bullets designed and intended for use in rifles (including hunting rifles) have, over the years, been used in special-purpose hunting and target handguns, thus they ‘may be used in a handgun.’""

The 2012 version of the attack drops the qualifier ""virtually"" but ignores that the NRA’s own research found that ""many"" -- not all -- bullets designed for rifles can be used in special-purpose handguns.

Moreover, the proposed changes would not have outlawed any ammunition completely. Federal law does not prohibit the use or possession of armor-piercing rounds, and Kennedy’s amendment wouldn’t have changed that. Point being, you could keep the ammo you have. You can do a quick Google search and find plenty of people in chat rooms discussing the ""AP"" rounds they acquired or own.

The NRA’s claim was found to be misleading in 2008 by fact-checkers working for the Washington Post, CNN and Factcheck.org.

Said Factcheck.org in 2008: ""We grant that it is a theoretical possibility that some future administration could interpret Kennedy’s language as banning common hunting ammunition, despite Kennedy’s clear statement of intent to the contrary. But we judge the likelihood of that to be vanishingly small, given the outcry that would surely follow.""

Our ruling

In its best light, the NRA claim is cherry-picking an extreme, worst-case interpretation of an amendment proposed by Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy. But even if you accept the NRA’s rationale -- which we do not -- the group fails to prove that Obama supports a ban on ""all deer-hunting ammunition.""

It’s entirely possible Obama voted for Kennedy’s amendment and still would have opposed a ban on deer-hunting ammunition. (For the record, there’s no evidence of Obama acting on a deer-hunting ammunition ban during his first term as president.)

Moreover, it’s worth noting that the use and possession of armor-piercing ammunition for handguns is not a federal crime. That would not have changed if Kennedy’s amendment passed.

"""According to ATF data, 70 percent of firearms recovered and traced in drug cartel crimes in Mexico originated from the United States.""","
U.S. Rep. Jim Moran made a recent plea on the House floor to preserve requirements that licensed gun dealers in four states bordering Mexico report customers buying multiple assault rifles to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.

Funding for the program was a small but controversial part of a House appropriations bill setting the budget for the departments of Commerce and Justice for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1.

Moran, D-8th, said the gun-reporting program -- begun in summer 2011 -- has helped the ATF investigate illegal gun trafficking by Mexican drug cartels. ""According to ATF data, 70 percent of firearms recovered and traced in drug cartel crimes in Mexico originated from the United States,"" he said in a May 9 floor speech.

The reporting requirement, strongly opposed by the National Rifle Association, was stripped from the House budget on March 10. The appropriations bill, which was subsequently passed by the chamber, is pending in the Senate.

We wondered if Moran is right that 70 percent of the known firearms used by Mexican drug cartels have been traced to the U.S.  His spokeswoman, Anne Hughes, pointed us to an ATF report on the guns recovered from 2007-11 that the agency had traced at the request of the Mexican government.

In 2011, Mexico asked the ATF to check the origin of 20,335 firearms. The agency determined that 14,504, or 71.3 percent, had been made in or legally imported to the U.S. before getting to Mexico.

Over the five years included in the report, ATF traced 99,691 firearms for Mexico. Of those, 68,161 came from the U.S., or 68.4 percent.

An ATF news release announcing the data said all of the weapons were crime guns that were recovered in Mexico. The agency, however, did not specify the types of crime.

Moran, in describing the findings, misfired. He specifically tied the guns to ""drug cartel crime.""

But that doesn’t mean his statement is invalid. There are compelling reasons to believe U.S. guns play a major role in the Mexican drug trade.

Private sales of firearms are illegal in Mexico. All gun sales must go through the federal government. The license and sale application process is lengthy and only smaller-caliber pistols and rifles are available through legal means.

The ATF news release said Mexican government reports that drug trafficking organizations are increasingly using assault and sniper rifles. The agency said the guns Mexico is asking it to trace are trending away from pistols and revolvers to rifles.

Until recent years, poor record-keeping by Mexico has made it impossible to estimate the impact of drug cartel offenses on the nation’s overall crime rates.

In 2009, the Mexican government started a system for reporting drug-related homicides, but there’s not absolute faith in its data. A 2011 study by The Trans-Border Institute at the University of San Diego noted that many local Mexican police departments lack the resources to investigate whether a murder was drug related.

In 2010, the Mexican census reported 24,374 murders in the nation. The Mexican government tied 15,273 to the drug cartels. In 2009, the census reported 19,803 homicides and the government said 9,614 were caused by the cartels.

A U.S. Government Accountability Office report, conducted June 2008 through June 2009, found a close correlation between the ATF data and the percentage of guns in Mexico that originate in the U.S.

The study said, ""U.S. law enforcement officials who had worked on arms trafficking in Mexico and along the U.S.-Mexican border told us their experience and observations corroborated that most of the firearms in Mexico had originated in the United States.

""Furthermore, U.S. and Mexican government and law enforcement officials also stated this scenario seemed most likely, given the ease of acquiring firearms in the United States; specifically, they told us they saw no reason why the drug cartels would go through the difficulty of acquiring a gun somewhere else in the world and transporting it to Mexico when it is so easy for them to do so from the United States.""

Our ruling 
Moran said ATF statistics show ""70 percent of firearms recovered and traced in drug cartel crimes in Mexico come from the United States.""

He muffed his statement; the U.S. guns were involved in Mexican crimes, not necessarily drug trafficking. But officials in both governments say U.S. -sourced guns make up a large proportion of guns carried by drug traffickers",Mostly True,"May 29, 2012"
"Says Tom Barrett ""voted to ban 15 different kinds of guns, even a lot of common deer rifles.""","
In the Wisconsin gubernatorial recall campaign, Democratic challenger Tom Barrett has been hit by Republican Gov. Scott Walker on his record as Milwaukee's mayor.

Taking a new tack, the National Rifle Association, which has endorsed Walker, goes back in time to attack Barrett's record in Congress, where he served for a decade before deciding not to run again in 2002.

In a radio ad that began airing in May 2012, two men talk about Barrett. Here’s part of the conversation:

Man 1: ""Well, Barrett voted to ban 15 different kinds of guns, even a lot of common deer rifles.""

Man 2: ""I love my deer rifle. Barrett voted to ban ‘em?""

Man 1: ""Yeah.""

Wisconsin's gun deer hunting season is months away, but you can bet the hundreds of thousands of hunters in the Badger State took notice of the NRA's claim.

Is it on target?

To back its claim, the NRA cited Barrett's 1994 vote to ban the manufacture, sale and new ownership of 19 semiautomatic assault-style weapons. The measure was signed into law by President Bill Clinton, who said the guns ""were designed to kill people"" and ""had no place on a deer hunt.""

The law contained provisions, however, allowing sales of the guns to continue. And the law expired in 2004, after Republican leaders in Congress refused to consider renewing it.

Among the weapons covered by the law were semiautomatic rifles that had ""an ability to accept a detachable magazine"" and at least two of these characteristics: ""folding or telescoping stock; a pistol grip that protrudes conspicuously beneath the action of the weapon; a bayonet mount; a flash suppressor or threaded barrel designed to accommodate a flash suppressor; and a grenade launcher.""

Does this apply to ""a lot of common deer rifles"" as the ad claims?

NRA’s evidence

NRA research director John Frazer cited five newspaper and magazine articles from the late 1980s and early 1990s.

The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that the Soviet-model AK-47 assault rifle was becoming more popular with hunters in that area, including deer hunters. One gun shop owner was quoted as saying hunters had been using military-style semi-automatic rifles since before World War II. The Houston Post reported that, according to local gun shop managers, it was not uncommon for Texans to hunt with semiautomatic rifles. That article didn’t indicate, however, whether the specific guns targeted in the ban were commonly used for deer hunting.

On a national scale, American Hunter magazine praised the Heckler & Koch 91 as a hunting rifle for deer and other game, but didn’t indicate whether it was popular among deer hunters. In fact, the writer said the gun might be a ""‘black sheep’ to traditionalists.""

Similarly, American Rifleman praised a particular type of AK-47 ammunition for hunting white-tail deer, but didn’t discuss whether the gun itself was common among deer hunters. The magazine later reported, though, that ""hundreds of thousands of shooters and hunters,"" including whitetail deer hunters, were using another gun covered by the ban, the AR-15.

So, there’s an indication that some deer hunters used the weapons targeted by the ban, but none of the articles was specific to Wisconsin. The NRA’s claim was broad in nature, but its ad is aimed at Wisconsin voters.

Wisconsin experts

We contacted three Wisconsin gun deer hunting experts.

Each said flatly that the banned weapons were not commonly used for deer hunting when the ban became law in 1994.

The experts were Tim Lawhern, administrator of the enforcement division of the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, the state agency that oversees deer hunting; Mark Toso, president of the Wisconsin Deer Hunters Association and Paul A. Smith, outdoors editor of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. Each has more than 30 years of experience hunting deer.

Lawhern, who taught DNR hunter safety classes for 18 years, recalled that when he worked in the field in the mid-1990s he would see perhaps half a dozen hunters each season using an assault-style weapon.

Toso -- who said he recently ended his longtime NRA membership in opposition to many of the group’s political messages -- called the percentage of gun deer hunters using weapons covered by the ban ""tiny"" at the time of the ban. (His association has not made an endorsement in the governor’s race.)

And Smith said that from his experience, while firearms such as the AK-47 and the AR-15 ""have gained favor among some hunters and sport shooters in recent decades, they constitute a small fraction of deer hunting rifles in use today and were an even smaller fraction in 1994.""

Our rating

The NRA said Barrett voted to ban ""a lot of common deer rifles.""

"""Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton are negotiating with the United Nations about doing a treaty that will ban the use of firearms.""","
Republican U.S. Senate hopeful Craig James of Texas drew a standing ovation this week after warning that President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton seek an international agreement banning the use of guns on U.S. soil.

James, sitting on stage at a Grassroots America candidate forum in Tyler on May 16, 2012, said: ""I’m going to stand up because I want to make sure you don’t forget what I’m going to say right now."" An Austin American-Statesman reporter recorded his remarks.

""If anybody in this room has not been following this, the United States, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton are negotiating with the United Nations about doing a treaty that will ban the use of firearms,"" James said. ""I want you to know that the Second Amendment is about to be busted and if we don’t stand up and stop this and scream and make sure that Washington, D.C. hears us, then we’re in trouble with the Second Amendment.

""Where is the next part that they take away? This is insane,"" James said. He subsequently urged everyone to make sure friends and neighbors understand the U.S. is trying to ban and get rid of the Second Amendment, which says: ""A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.""

""Don’t let them fool you any other way. We don’t want to wake up one morning and realize that we have to send our firearms (away) – and I’ve got a bunch of ‘em,"" James said. The ovation followed.

Asked to elaborate, James’ spokeswoman Meredith Turney said the next day that James was probably referring to his support for legislation offered by U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kansas.

Turney guided us to a May 17, 2012, Senate floor speech in which Moran pointed out that a UN conference scheduled for July 2012 could lead to an international treaty regulating trade in conventional arms including tanks, helicopters and missiles. Whether the treaty includes limits on civilian firearms, Moran said, remains to be seen.

He also said he expects any treaty impinging on domestic gun rights to fall short of winning the constitutionally required two-thirds’ Senate approval needed for ratification.

Moran’s Second Amendment Sovereignty Act, introduced in March 2012, bars U.S. funds from being committed or spent in connection with treaty negotiations to restrict the Second Amendment rights of citizens or to regulate the domestic manufacture, assembly, possession, use, transfer or purchase of firearms, ammunition or related items.

In his speech, Moran said his measure also is intended to back the Obama administration’s position that the U.S. will not agree to any treaty infringing on the constitutional rights of American citizens or to provisions that would alter or diminish existing rights to manufacture, assemble, possess, transfer or purchase firearms, ammunition or related items.

Moran said he was referring to a letter he fielded from the State Department in August 2011. We failed to land a copy, but in a more recent, April 16, 2012, speech to the Stimson Center in Washington, Thomas Countryman, an assistant secretary in the State Department’s Bureau of International Security and Nonproliferation, summarized the administration’s goals for the arms trade treaty conference in part by saying provisions limiting domestic gun rights would not be embraced.

""We will not support outcomes that would in any way infringe on the Second Amendment,"" Countryman said. ""...This has been the position of the executive branch since 2009, and it remains our position today. We will not support or agree to any treaty that would do so. We believe that the international community can draft a treaty on international arms transfers that would both increase international security and still protect sovereign rights of nations. That is the treaty that the United States will pursue in July and for which we expect there will be widespread support.""

As we looked into James’ claim, we noticed our friends at FactCheck.org looked into a similar claim in December 2009. That analysis, headlined ""International Gun Ban Treaty?,"" says Obama, reversing course from his predecessor, George W. Bush, agreed in 2009 to work with other UN member nations toward a conference possibly leading to an arms trade treaty. The article says that on Oct. 28, 2009, the UN General Assembly voted 153-1 to move forward in preparation for a conference, with the United States voting ""aye.""

Critics including former UN Ambassador John Bolton aired suspicions that any such treaty would require nations to restrict the domestic ownership of firearms, FactCheck.org reported, though a related General Assembly resolution acknowledged the right of nations to regulate internal transfers of arms and national ownership, including through national constitutional protections on private ownership. Another provision, the story says, acknowledges that countries have a right to arms for ""self-defence and security needs and in order to participate in peace support operations.""

Also noted by FactCheck.org: Two weeks before the cited General Assembly vote, Clinton insisted that any decisions at the conference on the treaty would be made by ""consensus,"" meaning that every country would have veto power on the negotiated agreement, according to an Oct. 14, 2009, Reuters news article, and it wouldn’t go into effect without the approval of all. In short, FactCheck.org said, no treaty will take effect if the U.S. disagrees.

So, the United States plans to participate in a conference possibly resulting in a treaty regulating the international arms trade, but the Obama administration has said it won’t support limits on the Second Amendment.

We followed up with Turney by asking if James had evidence of Obama and Clinton pushing to ban the use of firearms. She replied by email that James is ""very concerned that citizens need to keep pressure on the administration to defend the Second Amendment, especially heading into UN treaty negotiations.""

Our ruling

We found no evidence of Obama or Clinton indicating they want the UN conference on an arms trade treaty to ban the use of firearms; the recent speech by an administration underling states the government will not back a treaty that infringes on the Second Amendment.

"Says ""in our gun laws we’re allowing domestic abusers to sidestep this ban on getting a gun. The loophole allows a convicted abuser to walk into a gun show and walk out with a gun, no questions asked.""","
U.S. Sen. Frank Lautenberg pushed through a law 15 years ago that prohibits people convicted of domestic violence from acquiring a gun. But the Democrat said there’s still avenues for those individuals to arm themselves.

Lautenberg spoke April 26 on the Senate floor in favor of reauthorizing legislation that supports efforts to help victims of domestic violence and sexual abuse. During his speech, he said even more needs to be done in this area.

""Let me be clear. It would be tragic to turn our backs on victims and the people who dedicate their lives to supporting them. While we can’t stop all malicious acts, we can do more to keep women and their families safe,"" Lautenberg said. ""In 1996, I wrote the domestic violence gun ban, [which] forbids anyone convicted of domestic violence from getting a gun. Since the law's inception, we have kept guns from falling into violent hands on over 200,000 occasions. For instance, in our gun laws we’re allowing domestic abusers to sidestep this ban on getting a gun. The loophole allows a convicted abuser to walk into a gun show and walk out with a gun, no questions asked.""

PolitiFact New Jersey wondered if it’s that simple for someone who, under federal law isn’t allowed to have a gun, to buy one.

""Yes,"" said James Jacobs, director of the Center for Research in Crime and Justice at New York University School of Law, it’s ""that simple.""

Lautenberg was describing what is commonly known as the ""gun show loophole."" The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, or Brady Act, requires all federally licensed firearms dealers to run a background check on potential customers to ensure they are not prohibited from owning a gun.

But private sellers without a federal license don’t have to meet the same requirement. Though this exception is known as the ""gun show loophole,"" unlicensed individuals don’t have to perform background checks whether they are selling a gun at a gun show or somewhere else.

""Of course, a prohibited possessor can also buy from a private party outside of a gun show with no paperwork or background check,"" said Gabriel Chin, professor of law at the University of California at Davis School of Law. ""But the trick is that many of the private sellers at gun shows are really unlicensed full time dealers, so they may be selling scores or hundreds of guns a year with no paperwork.  Because of the volume, they are much more reliable sources of firearms for prohibited possessors.""

As a result of the loophole, ""it’s possible a convicted felon could go into a gun show and buy a firearm without ever being checked,"" said Chris Bombardiere, public information officer at the Newark Field Division of the  Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.

That isn’t possible everywhere, however, since some states have passed more restrictive gun laws. According to the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, 17 states, including New Jersey, ""have either closed the gun show loophole or have taken action to close the loophole.""

Our ruling

Lautenberg said that ""in our gun laws we’re allowing domestic abusers to sidestep this ban on getting a gun. The loophole allows a convicted abuser to walk into a gun show and walk out with a gun, no questions asked.""

That statement is true because federal law does not require individuals who are not federally licensed to perform background checks before a gun transaction, whether they are at a gun show or not.

Though laws can vary state to state and some states have passed laws that have essentially closed that loophole, this does not diminish Lautenberg’s statement. He was speaking on the Senate floor about federal law",True,"May 3, 2012"

A quick refresher on the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution: It says: ""A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.""

The 2008 case District of Columbia vs. Heller struck down the District of Columbia’s handgun-ownership ban. It also marked the first time the Supreme Court said the Second Amendment secures an individual right to gun ownership. But the decision was split 5-4 — and justices who didn’t side with the majority offered two dissenting opinions.

The dissents offered two views about self-defense.

Justice John Paul Stevens wrote, ""There is no indication that the Framers of the Amendment intended to enshrine the common-law right of self-defense in the Constitution.""

So, Stevens acknowledged a ""common-law right,"" but not necessarily a constitutional right.

Justice Stephen Breyer wrote: 
""Thus I here assume that one objective (but, as the majority concedes ... not the primary objective) of those who wrote the Second Amendment was to help assure citizens that they would have arms available for purposes of self-defense. ... 
""I shall, as I said, assume with the majority that the Amendment, in addition to furthering a militia-related purpose, also furthers an interest in possessing guns for purposes of self-defense, at least to some degree. ... Although I adopt for present purposes the majority's position that the Second Amendment embodies a general concern about self- defense, I shall not assume that the Amendment contains a specific untouchable right to keep guns in the house to shoot burglars. … 
""(T)he self-defense interest in maintaining loaded handguns in the home to shoot intruders is not the primary interest, but at most a subsidiary interest, that the Second Amendment seeks to serve."" 

So, Breyer acknowledges that one objective of the Second Amendment -- but not the primary objective -- is to allow citizens guns for self-defense, along with ""a general concern about self-defense,"" and ""a subsidiary interest"" in keeping loaded handguns at home.

Stevens and Breyer, along with Justice David Souter and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, joined both dissenting opinions.   
That's four justices. But we should note that Stevens and Souter are no longer on the court, replaced in recent years by Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor. Nugent's phrase, ""We've got four Supreme Court justices who ..."" suggests he meant four current justices. Still, Sotomayor sided with the minority in a 2010 case, McDonald vs. Chicago, which affirmed the decision in District of Columbia vs. Heller, and Kagan hasn't yet tipped her hand. 
About the opinions themselves: We contacted a few attorneys who have argued before the Supreme Court to help us weigh whether those they could reasonably be described as ""a declaration that Americans have no fundamental right to self-defense.""

‘Fundamental right’

It turns out ""fundamental right"" has a fairly specific meaning in constitutional law. Justices divide constitutional rights into categories, such as fundamental and nonfundamental.

Fundamental rights, as you might have guessed, trigger a higher level of protection from the court. Laws that might infringe on such rights face ""strict scrutiny."" But regulations that infringe on nonfundamental rights have a much easier burden to pass constitutional muster. They just have to have ""a rational basis.""

Clark Neily, an attorney who helped represent security guard Dick Anthony Heller in District of Columbia vs. Heller, says it looks to him like the dissenting judges treated self-defense more like the court typically treats nonfundamental rights than fundamental rights.

In other words, Nugent's characterization was reasonably accurate.

Tom Goldstein, the publisher of SCOTUSblog who has argued 25 cases before the Supreme Court, agrees.

""I think Ted is correctly describing what the dissenters … believe,"" he said.

But Erwin Chemerinsky, the founding dean of University of California at Irvine School of Law, whose most recent book was The Conservative Assault on the Constitution, found Nugent’s statement misleading.

""The statement from Justice Stevens was about whether the Second Amendment right to bear arms includes a right to have firearms in the home,"" he said. ""The justices did not deny that self-defense is available as a defense in criminal cases in all 50 states. The Nugent statement made it seem that the justices were questioning that.""

In other words, Nugent’s use of the legal phrase ""fundamental right"" might make lay people think those justices disagree with self-defense as protection in criminal cases.

We’re willing to give Nugent credit for using the correct term of art, in this case ""fundamental right."" Still, we’ll ding him for saying the justices signed their name to a ""declaration,"" when he meant dissenting opinions in a court case — especially since they didn’t make it explicitly clear that self-defense was a nonfundamental right. Even Neily found that a stretch.

Our ruling

Nugent, an NRA board member for almost 20 years, told a crowd that, ""We’ve got four Supreme Court justices who … signed their name to a declaration that Americans have no fundamental right to self-defense.""  We find the phrase ""a declaration"" an exaggeration, along with the suggestion that all four justices are still on the court. But he’s correct that four justices signed on to dissenting opinions in District of Columbia vs. Heller that find some right to self-defense — but arguably not a fundamental right earning the Supreme Court’s highest level of protection. He used the right phrase. Still, ""a declaration"" and ""four justices"" make the statement just partially accurate",Half True,"April 23, 2012"
"""The bulk of the people who are shot with a weapon — other than these drug gangs taking on one another — end up being shot with their own weapon.""","
In an interview on CBS’ Face the Nation, Vice President Joe Biden was asked about the Trayvon Martin killing in Sanford, Fla.

""Do you, on balance, think these laws are good laws?"" host Bob Schieffer asked in the April 1, 2012, program, referring to Florida’s ""stand your ground"" self-defense law and others around the country.

Biden said he thinks it’s important to protect Second Amendment rights but expressed skepticism of laws that could result in people putting themselves in harm’s way. He said he’s ""not so sure of"" the idea that owning and carrying guns makes people safer.

He also threw out this claim about gun violence: ""You know, the bulk of the people who are shot with a weapon — other than these drug gangs taking on one another — end up being shot with their own weapon.""

We decided to check that out.

Biden’s office pointed us to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which shows that the majority of firearm deaths in the U.S. are by suicide, and most suicides are committed with the deceased's own gun.

David Hemenway, a public health professor at Harvard University, looked at 2009 specifically and noted that the CDC figures show 18,735 firearm suicides; 11,493 firearm homicides; and some 554 unintentional firearm deaths. ""The large majority of firearm suicides use their own (or the family gun), while the large majority of firearm homicides are shot with someone else’s gun,"" Hemenway said.

So Biden’s statement, in Hemenway’s estimation, is ""very likely true"" if Biden was talking only about firearm deaths.

Statistics that include non-fatal shootings paint a different picture, with more resulting from assaults than from suicides.

""The estimates of non-fatal shootings are very rough (estimated from under 100 emergency departments), but the CDC estimates from 2009 are only 3,000 plus non-fatal suicide shootings, compared to over 44,000 assault shootings,"" he said.

Including non-fatal shootings in the study group, Hemenway said, makes Biden’s statement ""very likely untrue"" because people don’t typically become the victim of assaults with their own guns.

Donald Braman, a law professor at George Washington University, also said the statement is ""probably technically true but also misleading as most gun fatalities are suicides.""

""Biden's claim implies that people are having their weapons turned against them by someone else when, in fact, the modal gun death is probably a debt-ridden farmer,"" Braman wrote in an email.

We agree that Biden did not seem to be talking about suicides. He was answering a question about self-defense laws and the danger of people putting themselves in harm’s way. And certainly the Martin killing was unrelated to suicide.

""What Biden seems to be saying,"" Braman wrote, ""is that the likelihood that you will shoot someone with a gun you buy in self-defense is smaller than the likelihood that you (or someone in your household) will be shot with that same gun. That is technically true unless you start excluding suicides, etc. -- then I don't know -- and he's got a point: guns most often injure people in the gun owner's household, not an intruder or stranger.  

""But it is also potentially misleading in two ways. First, it suggests that people who buy guns are more likely to be harmed than protected by a gun they buy. We just don't have good data on that. … Second, it suggests that the harms people are suffering are at the hands of others, when (as I pointed out before) most of the time it is a suicide or suicide attempt.""

Our ruling

Biden said ""the bulk"" of people who are shot with a weapon are shot with their own weapon. The numbers that back up that statement refer only to fatal shootings, including a high proportion of suicides. CDC figures show, and our experts verified, that the majority of gun deaths are suicides, and the majority of suicides are committed with a person’s own gun or a gun owned by someone in the household.

Although the numbers for non-fatal shootings are rough, such assaults typically don't involve the use of the victim's gun, experts told us. Biden cited a true statistic but left out the important detail and context that he was talking only about fatal shootings, which would include suicides",Half True,"April 16, 2012"
"The Florida Department of Agriculture’s website FreshFromFlorida.com can be used ""to get a permit to carry a loaded hidden gun without ever leaving your house.""","
Obtaining a permit to carry a concealed gun in Florida is so easy that Floridians can do it without leaving the comfort of their own homes, according to the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence.

Dan Gross, the president of the group, testified about Florida’s gun laws at a briefing held with some congressional Democrats March 27. The topic was racial profiling and ""stand your ground"" laws in the wake of the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin. 
Martin, an unarmed black teenager from Miami Gardens, was shot and killed by a white neighborhood watch volunteer in Sanford, Fla. The volunteer, George Zimmerman, has not been arrested, and that has spurred debate of Florida’s ""stand your ground"" gun law.

The Brady Campaign says Florida has become a ""great success story"" for the gun lobby.

""In Florida, being armed in public is such a casual formality that law enforcement does not issue the license to carry loaded, concealed guns; that is done by the Department of Agriculture – the same agency charged with issuing permits to pick tomatoes or transport livestock,"" Gross said.  
""Their website is FreshFromFlorida.com. You can use it to get a permit to carry a loaded hidden gun without ever leaving your house,"" he added.

Gross made it sound incredibly easy to obtain a concealed weapons permit. Can Floridians simply log on to FreshFromFlorida.com and obtain a weapons permit without getting off the couch? We decided to investigate.

Requirements for a concealed weapons permit in Florida

The Brady Campaign is right that it is the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services that issues concealed weapons permits. It was easy to download the two-page application and about 45 pages containing the application instructions and the law.

But the process is much more complicated than just filling out an online form.

Candidates must provide a photograph, pay a fee and have their application form notarized. Most significantly for purposes of this fact-check, applicants must show proof of having gone through a firearms training class, and they must be fingerprinted. (Out-of-state applicants don’t have to come to Florida but must follow the same guidelines, including getting fingerprinted by law enforcement.) We thought those two requirements showed the Brady Campaign was wrong in its statement.

The Brady Campaign, though, responded to our questions and argued that even these two criteria could be done from home. So let’s review the evidence.

• Firearms training documentation: Florida law states in 790.06(2)(h) that an instructor ""must maintain records certifying that he or she observed the student safely handle and discharge the firearm."" That can be a class taught by law enforcement, the National Rifle Association, or any other class approved by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.

So that rules out an online course, said Sterling Ivey, spokeman for the agriculture department.

But the Brady Campaign responded that some certified instructors will come to your home, pointing us to groups like Florida Concealed Weapons Carry. Its website states: ""We will come to your location and provide a shooting trailer anywhere within an hour and a half radius from Starke, Fla. We provide all materials, concealed weapons pictures, and notary on the spot.""

We spoke to the owner of that company, Eric Wall.

""When I go to their house we usually have it in their living room or whatever to go over the details of concealed carry,"" he said. Then the applicants head to his trailer, which is a mobile shooting range. ""I have to physically watch everyone handle, load and shoot a firearm.""

Worried the neighbors might complain about your participation in a mobile firearm class in your driveway?

The trailer is soundproof, said Wall. He’s even done training at dentists’ and doctors' offices, he said. (We should note that going into the trailer means you need to leave your house, even though you're still on your own property.)

Wall said he can take care of the firearms class, photo and notary all at an applicant's home. Typically, Wall trains small groups and charges $50 per person, but it depends on the distance he has to travel. 

We also spoke to Irving Gelbart, a retired Miami-Dade police lieutenant who teaches mobile classes through his company, Pentagon Defense Products and Training Alliance. Gelbart said he will do the class work in someone’s home but prefers a range for the shooting portion.

The Brady Campaign also noted that applicants can use past shooting experience, pointing to language on the application that says acceptable documentation includes ""evidence of experience with a firearm obtained through participation in organized shooting competition.""

Ivey said a mobile firearm class is allowed, as long as it meets the requirements of having the instructor observe the student safely handle the firearm. He also said that past shooting experience is acceptable, but that would likely have meant the person left their home.

• A set of fingerprints or a copy of a receipt showing that they had a scan of their fingerprints: Florida’s application states that ""fingerprints must be taken at a LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY’’ and the statute requires ""a full set of fingerprints of the applicant administered by a law enforcement agency.

We thought this element definitely contradicted the Brady Campaign’s statement, but spokeswoman Caroline Brewer said not so fast.

""Our statement was discussing the application form that is downloadable from the Florida website, which the context makes clear,"" she said via email. ""However, even if you read our statement as applying to the separate fingerprint card sent by mail and not downloadable, yes, there are many fingerprinting services that say they will come to your home to take your fingerprints, some of which even say that they are done under the authority of law enforcement and valid for Florida.""

The Brady Campaign pointed us to several mobile fingerprinting services. These services do exist, but we could not find a mobile company that would provide this service at Floridians’ homes. We spoke to owners at three mobile fingerprint companies in Florida -- 1 SureScan in Orlando, Anytime Mobile Fingerprinting in the Tampa area and Fingerprint Technologies in Coral Gables -- who told us that they had inquired with FDLE about providing that service and had been discouraged or told it wasn’t allowed. 

We asked FDLE if they would accept fingerprints from a mobile company for the concealed weapons permit. FDLE spokesman Keith Kameg replied: ""It is our understanding that FL Statute 790.06 (4)(c) states that fingerprinting is to be administered by a law enforcement agency.  FDLE performs the background checks and provides the results to Department of Agriculture.""

Possible -- but common?

Clearly, many applicants handle at least part of the application process from home: Since July 2011, about 45,000 used the agriculture department’s regional offices while 89,000 mailed them in from elsewhere.

And it is possible to download the permit from FreshFromFlorida.com, hire a mobile firearm instructor/notary/photographer, and mail in the application from home. There is no way to know how many applicants -- if any  -- have done that. Several experts on Florida’s permitting process said either that they had never heard of mobile firearms training or that it was a rarity.

The part of the Brady Campaign's claim that seems to fall short is about fingerprints: We could not find any indication that applicants in Florida could summon mobile fingerprinters to their homes.

Our ruling

Dan Gross, the president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, said that at the Florida Department of Agriculture’s website FreshFromFlorida.com, people can ""get a permit to carry a loaded hidden gun without ever leaving your house.""

The Brady Campaign argued that their claim referred to the application itself. But fingerprints are required as part of the application process, and Gross made no such distinction in his statement.

We think his overall message was clear: He was trying to convey that it’s so easy to get a gun permit that you can do it from home.

The law, though, requires that people receive firearms training and be fingerprinted by law enforcement, two elements that would typically require people to leave their homes. While it’s possible to pay a firearms trainer to come to your property, we found no evidence that such training is widespread. We also found no evidence that mobile fingerprinting would be allowed for the gun permit application in the state of Florida",False,"April 3, 2012"
"Since Florida passed the ""stand your ground"" law in 2005, deaths due to self-defense have jumped over 250 percent.","
The fatal shooting of unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin by a neighborhood watch volunteer in Sanford, Fla., has reopened debate about the state’s ""stand your ground"" law.

One of the arguments we’ve heard from lawmakers wanting to change the 2005 law is that deaths due to self-defense are up dramatically since ""stand your ground"" passed. The law -- approved overwhelmingly by the Legislature and signed by Gov. Jeb Bush in 2005 -- allows people to use deadly force when they believe their life is at risk.

Sen. Chris Smith, a Democrat who represents parts of Broward and Palm Beach counties, wants to rewrite the law because he fears its protections are too broad. Smith wants to change the law so that it only applies in cases that take place in a home, car or at work. He also wants to prohibit the use of ""stand your ground"" in cases where the shooter has provoked a confrontation, Smith said in a March 21 press release sent by the Senate Democratic office.

""This law has been a double-edged sword,"" said Smith, who was the House Democratic leader in 2005 when ""stand your ground"" passed. Smith voted against the law. ""Stand your ground’ appears to be giving suspects better protections from arrest and prosecution than increased security measures for the citizens the law was originally intended to protect. This needs to be dramatically changed. … We can’t keep turning a blind eye to the number of lives this law has claimed.""

According to the press release, Smith noted that ""since the law’s passage, deaths due to self defense have jumped over 250 percent."" 
That’s a significant increase worth checking out.

As we do in cases like this, we’ll first check the numbers and then check to see if ""stand your ground"" is to blame as Smith suggests.

The statistic

The ""stand your ground"" statute states that ""a person who is not engaged in an unlawful activity and who is attacked in any other place where he or she has a right to be has no duty to retreat and has the right to stand his or her ground and meet force with force, including deadly force if he or she reasonably believes it is necessary to do so to prevent death or great bodily harm to himself or herself or another or to prevent the commission of a forcible felony.""

Smith’s office and the Senate Democratic office pointed to news stories -- a 2010 article in the Tampa Bay Times and a March 20, 2012, report on CBS 4 -- about the number of ""justifiable homicides,"" since the ""stand your ground"" law passed in 2005.

We contacted the Florida Department of Law Enforcement directly for data on justifiable homicides from 2000-10 and through the first half of 2011.

FDLE uses this definition of justifiable homicides when collecting data for the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting: ""The killing of the perpetrator of a serious criminal offense either by a law enforcement officer in the line of duty or by a private citizen, during the commission of a serious criminal offense.""

FDLE’s manual explains that the label is based on an investigating officer’s findings -- not on the actions by a prosecutor or court.

The FBI’s UCR handbook explains that a storekeeper shooting a gunman attempting a robbery is a justifiable homicide. But if two men playing cards get into an argument in which the first man attacked the second with a broken bottle and the second man shot his attacker claiming self-defense, that should not be reported as justifiable homicide.

FDLE’s data is based on information reported by police departments -- that reporting is voluntary but nearly all the agencies comply, FDLE spokesman Keith Kameg said. The data refers to how police labeled the homicide -- not charging decisions by prosecutors or court outcomes. FDLE compiles the data for the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reports, a national source of crime statistics.

Here’s a breakdown by calendar year and whether the person acting in self-defense was a civilian or a law enforcement officer: 
  
From 2000-04 -- the five full years before ""stand your ground"" took effect -- law enforcement agencies in Florida reported an average of 12 justifiable homicides a year committed by civilians. From 2006-10 -- the first five full years after ""stand your ground"" became law -- law enforcement agencies reported an average of 36 justifiable homicides committed by civilians. Average to average, the number of justifiable homicides by civilians is now three times higher than it was in the years before 2005. That’s an increase of 200 percent. (We excluded 2005 from this calculation because the law went into effect part way through the year.)

Is ‘stand your ground’ to blame?

So Smith is a little high in his estimate using FDLE data. Next, we wondered whether the 2005 law is the reason justifiable homicides among civilians are up.

Experts we contacted didn’t agree whether there is a simple cause and effect.

Gary Kleck, a professor of criminology at Florida State University, has researched how the FBI and police departments define justifiable homicide.

Criminologists are suspicious of sharp increases or decreases within a short time frame, he said.

""I don’t believe anything triples.…Increases that sharp are probably due to some artificial cause like a shift in how people are defining events,"" Kleck said. ""It’s possible nothing actually changed in frequency except police departments increasingly defined homicide claimed to be defensive as a justifiable homicide. … Local police departments are increasingly viewing alleged defensible homicide as falling into the UCR definition. I don’t think they are trying to rig data, they honestly shifted their perceptions of what qualifies.""

Bill Eddins, state attorney in Florida’s 1st Circuit and president of the Florida Prosecuting Attorneys Association, said he couldn’t conclude if there is a correlation between the ""stand your ground"" law and the increase in justifiable homicides.

Although our overall crime rate has trended downward, ""the random violence seems to be increasing to me,"" Eddins said.

To determine the effect of the ""stand your ground"" law would require examining how many times the statute was used, the result of the case and whether or not the ""stand your ground"" statute contributed to that resolution, he said.

""There is no real measurement set up to do that at this point. I cannot reach the conclusion that there is a direct correlation in the increases of justifiable homicide as a result of stand your ground law. I know other people are saying you can, but I can’t reach it.""

Nancy Daniels, a public defender in the 2nd Circuit and president of the Florida Public Defender Association, said that she thinks there is a clear correlation between the ""stand your ground"" law and increase in justifiable homicide cases.

""The types of incidents involved in ‘stand your ground’ cases have always been with us, but some now are found to be justifiable,"" she said in an email. ""And who knows how many people have been emboldened to think violence is justified just because of the new law?""

Dennis Kenney, a criminal justice professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York and a former police officer in Polk County, said that determining correlation between the numbers and the law would require examining the cases and seeing how often elements from the ""stand your ground"" law were raised. Without examining the numbers or the cases themselves, Kenney said it’s ""highly likely"" that there is a correlation.

And Kenney, who was critical of the law, predicted: ""After all the publicity the current case is getting you would expect it to go up much more.""

David LaBahn, president of the Association of Prosecuting Attorneys based in Washington, said the increase in reported justifiable homicides could be the result of any number of factors -- including overall crime or population growth.

Our ruling

Smith said that since ""stand your ground"" passed in 2005, deaths due to self-defense have jumped over 250 percent. When we calculated the average for five years before the law passed and five years after it passed, we found an increase of 200 percent. That’s short of Smith’s claim, though the numbers largerly support the idea that self-defense deaths have increased since 2005. As for whether ""stand your ground"" is the reason self-defense deaths are up, experts either disagree or say it’s difficult to determine without examining the specifics of each case",Half True,"March 26, 2012"
"Says 85 percent of Milwaukee shootings involve ""people with extensive criminal records shooting other people with extensive criminal records.""","
If the nation has a more data-driven police chief than Milwaukee’s Edward A. Flynn, we’d like to know.

We think his middle initial might stand for Analysis.

Yet we couldn’t help wonder about a statistical claim that Flynn, a former Massachusetts public safety commissioner under then-Gov. Mitt Romney, made on  Feb. 9, 2012.

In the first of what are billed as monthly sit-downs with Milwaukee public radio station WUWM-FM (89.7), Flynn was asked which issues city residents say are most important for police to address.

Reducing ""measurable"" serious crime is a concern of both city and suburban Milwaukee residents, Flynn replied, adding:

""Perversely, in a way, people who actually live in the city recognize an extraordinary amount of our violent crime is highly concentrated among criminals perpetrating violence upon other criminals. It doesn't minimize its importance as a public safety issue; but they recognize that a lot of concerns in their neighborhoods are what we would call quality of life problems or lower-level crime problems.

""For the average resident of this city, they're much more concerned about a burglary than they are about a shooting because 85 percent of our shootings are people with extensive criminal records shooting other people with extensive criminal records. It's bad, we've got to solve the crime, we've got to break up the violence. But most folks recognize they're not a likely victim.""

The 85 percent figure caught our eye.

Is it true 85 percent of Milwaukee’s shootings involve ""people with extensive criminal records shooting other people with extensive criminal records""?

Flynn spokeswoman Anne E. Schwartz said the chief based his comment on a 2011 annual report by the city’s Homicide Review Commission, which annually reviews all types of homicides as well as non-fatal shootings.

The report wasn’t released until nearly a month after Flynn’s radio interview, but he had been told of the findings, said Mallory O’Brien, the commission’s director.

One important note about the 2011 report, before we get to the numbers, in terms of Flynn’s reference to ""extensive criminal record"": It provides complete prior arrest data for only some of the suspects and victims involved in the 2011 shootings. Included are juvenile and adult arrests for felony and misdemeanor crimes, as well as non-criminal ordinance violations, but not minor offenses such as speeding.

So, Flynn is setting a relatively low bar for ""extensive criminal records"" in that not all arrests, of course, lead to convictions or even criminal charges. And because complete prior arrest data are not available for all the people involved in the 2011 shootings, some assumptions are made by O’Brien the study’s author. That being said, O’Brien, a PhD epidemiologist, said her experience in doing the annual reports gives her confidence in making assumptions about the prior arrests of shooting suspects and victims.

So, as the chief himself might say, let’s get to the numbers.

Non-fatal shootings:

In non-fatal shootings in 2011, 97 percent of the 177 suspects and 86 percent of the 473 victims had at least one prior arrest. The report doesn’t say how many.

However, O’Brien said a closer analysis of non-fatal shootings during a six-week period in July and August 2011, when non-fatal shootings increased, found that suspects had an average of 7.5 prior arrests and victims had an average of about six. O’Brien said that based on her past studies, she would expect that the rest of the suspects and victims in the non-fatal shootings in 2011 had a similar number of prior arrests.

So, more than 85 percent of the people involved in non-fatal shootings had at least one prior arrest. And there’s a strong indication, though not complete numbers, that most people involved in the non-fatal shootings had at least several prior arrests.

Homicides:

For all homicides in 2011 -- those involving guns and those that didn’t -- 57 percent of the 72 suspects and 62 percent of the 66 homicide victims had at least six prior arrests.

O’Brien said that based on past studies she has done, most homicides involve guns and it’s unlikely that arrest records would vary greatly between the people involved in shooting homicides versus non-shooting homicides.

So, a clear majority, but less than 85 percent, of the people involved in fatal shootings likely had at least six prior arrests; although, again, the study doesn’t provide hard numbers on that point.

We asked James Alan Fox, a criminology, law and public policy professor at Northeastern University in Boston, about Flynn’s claim. He said from a national perspective, most shootings involve people with an arrest history, although he couldn’t say how extensive that history is for the typical shooting suspect or victim.

Our rating

Flynn said 85 percent of Milwaukee shootings ""are people with extensive criminal records shooting other people with extensive criminal records.""

The thrust of his statement -- that the vast majority of shooting suspects and victims have a criminal history, is accurate. But he made a specific statistical claim that isn’t fully supported by the study he cites. And as compared with charges or convictions, prior arrests as a measure of a person’s criminal record is on the lower end of the scale",Half True,"March 19, 2012"
"""Rhode Island is the only state where officers at state-supported [colleges] carry out their duties unarmed.""","
Rhode Island has long struggled with whether to arm its police on public college campuses.

In January, state Sen. Glenford J. Shibley introduced legislation that would allow officers who patrol the campuses of the state’s three public institutions -- the University of Rhode Island, Rhode Island College and the Community College of Rhode Island -- to carry guns as long as they go through the requisite training.

""Rhode Island is the only state where officers at state-supported institutions carry out their duties unarmed,"" said a General Assembly news release issued on the Coventry Republican’s behalf,  announcing the introduction of his bill on Dec. 9.

At a hearing Feb. 28 before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Shibley repeated that statement, according to a Journal story, and expressed frustration with the state’s inaction on arming campus police.

""What’s the holdup?"" he said. ""Who’s waiting for what tragedy?""

Shibley’s claim intrigued us. Does the Ocean State really stand alone when it comes to allowing police on public campuses to carry guns?

Let’s begin with some history. The Board of Governors for Higher Education first considered arming campus police at Rhode Island’s public institutions in 2000. URI conducted its own study two years later but decided that the time wasn’t right to make the move.

In 2003, Brown -- a private institution -- decided to arm its police officers. Three years later, after the university’s sworn officers each received training in diversity, weapons and use-of-force, they were armed with semiautomatic pistols.

The state Board of Governors formed a committee in 2008 to take another look at arming campus police in the wake of the 2007 killing of 32 people at Virginia Tech by a lone gunman, and other shootings at schools elsewhere in the country.

In its March 22, 2010, report, the committee said that it had reached consensus that the Board of Governors should consider a plan to arm campus police at one or more of Rhode Island’s public institutions. But no action has been taken since then.

When we called Shibley, a former police officer and assistant director of Rhode Island’s municipal police academy, he said he made the claim about the state’s singular status based on a fact sheet provided by Lt. Charles P. Wilson, a former police chief in Ohio, now the third shift patrol supervisor at the campus police department at Rhode Island College.

The fact sheet states, ""Where legislation enabling campus law enforcement is concerned, only [Rhode Island] has language which specifically restricts campus police from carrying firearms.""

Shibley urged us to contact Wilson, who, he said, had carried out years of research on the arming of campus police.

Fifteen years, to be precise, said Wilson, who with his wife, Shirley A. Wilson, an associate professor of management at Bryant University, has written academic papers on general attitudes toward campus law enforcement and opposition to arming campus law enforcement.

He sent a spreadsheet he compiled on law enforcement agencies at 2,050 four-year educational institutions around the country. The spreadsheet, which he said took three months to compile, was based on information gleaned from school web sites, correspondence with individual campus police officers, state and federal reports and some 200 phone calls. He said he plans to use the spreadsheet as the basis of a research paper.

Wilson divided the schools according to whether they are private or public and also according to whether they have their own police officers on campus or instead use security guards. The latter is an important distinction. Campus police officers generally go through the same training as municipal police officers and learn how to safely handle guns. Security guards do not necessarily receive firearms training.

Rhode Island’s public educational institutions all use campus police officers. All officers are trained in firearms as part of mandatory training at the municipal police academy.

Of the 2,050 schools Wilson surveyed, 712 have police officers instead of security guards only. Of that number, 693 -- or 97 percent -- allow their officers to carry guns.

We asked Wilson about Shibley’s claim. He told us that for years, three states were often cited as prohibiting their campus police officers from carrying guns: Rhode Island, Iowa and Oregon.

But Iowa and Oregon have reversed their policies in recent years.

The Iowa Board of Regents approved firearms for campus police on Oct. 31, 2007. Within two weeks, the police officers at Iowa State University were armed.

And in Oregon last October, the state Board of Higher Education allowed the University of Oregon to convert public safety officers into full-fledged police who would be able to carry guns.

But it’s important to note that campus police officers at the university currently are not armed. Wilson expects them to be issued firearms by the end of this year, but the school still needs approval from the Oregon Board of Higher Education to take that step.

The only published survey we found that looked at firearms and campus law enforcement was done by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, an arm of the U.S. Department of Justice. The bureau released its most recent survey in February 2008. It was based on information collected about 750 four-year schools in 2004 and 2005.

The survey supported Shibley’s premise -- that the majority of colleges that use police officers allow them to carry arms -- but it’s outdated and does not break out its results on a state-by-state basis.

Our ruling

Shibley said that Rhode Island is the only state that doesn’t arm the police officers at its public educational institutions.

While Brown armed its officers six years ago, URI, CCRI and RIC haven’t followed suit.

The vast majority of U.S. schools that have police officers let them carry guns. That’s a fact confirmed by the U.S. Department of Justice and by Wilson, the RIC police supervisor.

Wilson is the only researcher we could locate who has broken down the issue by state, and according to his findings, Rhode Island is the lone hold out when it comes to allowing police at public schools to carry arms.

But even though campus police in Oregon are allowed by law to carry guns, they are not carrying guns yet. That’s an important detail that Wilson accounted for in the fact sheet he gave Shibley.

By glossing over this point, Shibley’s aim was slightly off the bull’s-eye, but he didn’t miss the target altogether",Mostly True,"March 7, 2012"
"Says Mitt Romney said he does not ""line up with the NRA.""","
Presidential candidate Rick Santorum is running a television ad that uses rival Mitt Romney’s own words against him.

The ad contains no voice-over, only sound effects as Romney’s quotes pop onto the screen against a black background. The first says, ""I don’t line up with the National Rifle Association.""

The NRA wields enormous political power at the state and national levels, and conservative candidates crave its endorsement. It’s startling to see a Republican contender distancing himself from the group, so we decided to delve into the ad’s claim.

Did Romney really say that?

In short, yes, he did. But it was in 1994.

Running for Senate in Massachusetts, Romney criticized his opponent, Democrat Ted Kennedy, for supporting a crime bill in Congress. Romney said Kennedy had worked to expand the cost of the bill while weakening several provisions.

According to a story in the Boston Globe about the issue, Romney stressed that he supported the bill's ban on 19 different types of assault weapons -- which the NRA opposed.

""I don't line up with the NRA,"" Romney said, according to the story.

The quote was not a blanket statement of disagreement with the NRA, as Santorum’s ad could suggest. Rather Romney was talking about a particular issue on which he didn't agree with the NRA's position.

At the time, Romney also voiced support for the Brady Bill, which imposed a five-day waiting period on gun sales. The NRA opposed that bill.

His words since

In 2002, while running for governor, Romney was still talking the gun control talk.

In a debate comment captured in this YouTube video, Romney said, ""We do have tough gun laws in Massachusetts. I support them. I won’t chip away at them. I believe they help protect us and provide for our safety.""

In fact, he expanded those protections in the state. In 2004, Gov. Romney signed a permanent ban on assault weapons such as the AK-47 and Uzi. The NRA called the law ""ineffective and unnecessary.""

By 2007, when he was making his first run for president, Romney’s tone had begun to change.

The Globe reported on his shift in rhetoric:

""He now touts his work as governor to ease restrictions on gun owners. He proudly describes himself as a member of the NRA -- though his campaign won't say when he joined. And Friday, at his campaign's request, top officials of the NRA and the National Shooting Sports Foundation led him around one of the country's biggest gun shows.

""Romney says he still backs the ban on assault weapons, but he won't say whether he stands by the Brady Bill. And after the gun show tour, his campaign declined to say whether he would still describe himself as a supporter of tough gun laws.""

The Globe later reported that Romney admitted to joining the NRA in August, 2006, just months before announcing his presidential candidacy.

At the time his campaign touted his pro-gun efforts as governor, including his signing of an NRA-backed bill that reduced a testing requirement on certain pistol-makers before they could sell guns in Massachusetts and his designation of May 7, 2005, as ""The Right to Bear Arms Day"" in Massachusetts to honor ""the right of decent, law-abiding citizens to own and use firearms in defense of their families, persons, and property and for all lawful purposes, including the common defense.""

The best evidence we found on the matter comes from a 2007 interview Romney gave on Meet the Press. Host Tim Russert confronted Romney with his quotes from 1994 and asked him to explain.

Romney said, ""My position on guns is the same position I’ve had for a long, long time. That position is that I don’t line up a hundred percent with the NRA. I don’t see eye to eye with the NRA on every issue.""

He said he still supported banning weapons that are ""unusually lethal"" but hedged on waiting periods. He said the Brady Bill originally included a waiting period because the time was necessary for performing background checks. Now that technology enables instant background checks, such waiting periods are unnecessary, he said. Then he spoke a bit about Second Amendment rights.

""We should not interfere with the right of law-abiding citizens to own guns, either for their own personal protection or hunting or any other lawful purpose. I support the work of the NRA, I’m a member of the NRA. But do we line up on every issue? No, we don’t,"" he told Russert.

The 2012 campaign

Romney didn’t attend the NRA’s national convention in 2011 in Pittsburgh and instead sent a videotaped message. He said nothing about gun rights. He offered congratulations to the organization and its leaders for their work defending the Constitution and criticized political leaders who would expand the reach of government.

""I believe in America. I believe in free enterprise,"" he said.

Romney’s campaign website has a section devoted to gun rights. It does not mention the NRA or the Massachusetts ban on assault weapons he signed as governor. Instead, it touts his work on behalf of gun owners, including extending the terms of gun licenses in Massachusetts and making replacement licenses free.

""As president, Mitt will work to expand and enhance access and opportunities for Americans to hunt, shoot, and protect their families, homes and property, and he will fight the battle on all fronts to protect and promote the Second Amendment,"" the website says.

We contacted the NRA for this story but didn’t hear back. The group has not endorsed any primary candidate -- which isn’t unusual. It didn’t announce its backing of John McCain in the last election until October of 2008. But the group has made clear its goal is to defeat President Barack Obama.

Christopher Cox, the NRA’s chief lobbyist told Fox Business Network anchor Lou Dobbs in February 2012 that ""any of these (Republican) candidates would be a lot better than this president. ... So we take any of them over this guy.""

Our ruling

Santorum’s ad flashes a quote from Romney saying ""I don’t line up with the National Rifle Association.""

The quote is accurate, though it omits the fact that Romney spoke those words 18 years ago and used them to describe his position on a single issue. Romney clearly has shifted his position on the issue of gun rights to align himself more closely with the NRA. For one thing, he became a member. And in campaigns subsequent to that 1994 senatorial bid, he has emphasized his work in favor of gun ownership rather than on tightening laws.

But when Romney addressed the issue in 2007, he did not contradict what he said in 1994. ""I support the work of the NRA, I’m a member of the NRA. But do we line up on every issue? No, we don’t,"" he told Tim Russert. What else? He signed an assault weapons ban opposed by the NRA as Massachusetts governor",True,"February 29, 2012"
"""It’s going to be harder to vote in Virginia than it is now to buy a gun...""","
State Sen. Janet Howell, D-Fairfax, recently complained about socially conservative bills being approved this winter by the Republican-controlled General Assembly.

During a Feb. 10 interview with Al Sharpton on MSNBC’s PoliticsNation, Howell called the GOP majority ""a steamroller"" in passing legislation to ease gun control laws and strengthen voter identification requirements.

""What’s really ironic with what’s happening is it’s going to be harder to vote in Virginia than it is to buy a gun with what they’re doing on gun control issues,"" she said.

Is it really becoming easier to buy a gun than cast a ballot in Virginia?

Howell told us her statement was a ""rhetorical slur."" She cited some of bills that have been approved by the General Assembly this year but did not offer a point-by-point comparison of the requirements to buy a gun or cast a vote.

So we looked at Virginia’s laws overseeing firearm purchases and voting. You have to be at least 18 for either activity. You have to be a state resident to vote in Virginia. But you don’t have to live in Virginia to buy a gun here.

Let’s examine the other requirements.

Identification

To register to vote, you must present a document that shows your name and address. It can be a valid photo ID, utility bill, bank statement, government check, paycheck or other government document.

To cast a ballot, you must show identification or sign a statement -- subject to felony conviction for false information -- that you are the registered voter you represent yourself to be. This requirement is being altered by the General Assembly this year, a point we’ll address later.

To buy a gun from a licensed dealer in Virginia, you must show primary and secondary forms of identification. The primary document must be a state-issued photo ID. The secondary identification just needs to contain your current address and can be a utility bill, voter registration card, bank check or hunting or fishing license.

But in the case of private guns sales -- if you buy a firearm from an individual who is not a licensed dealer -- the identification requirements go away. 
Application 

To register to vote, you must fill out and submit an application 22 days before a general or primary election. The form can be submitted at variety of locations or by mail.

To buy a gun from a licensed dealer, you have to submit to a computerized background check run by the state police. It’s usually completed in a matter of minutes, but can take as long as four days. The background check does not apply to private gun sales, and such transactions can occur instantly.

Disqualification

You can’t vote if you are a felon and have not had your rights restored, or if you have been judged mentally incapacitated.

Many things could turn up on a background check that would bar someone from buying a gun from a licensed dealer. They include conviction or indictment on felony charges, an outstanding warrant for a misdemeanor or felony, outstanding protective or restraining orders, use of illegal drugs, mental incompetency judgement, orders for mental health treatment, dishonorable discharge from military, and conviction on domestic violence charges.

In private sales, it is a felony to knowingly sell a gun to a person who would be disqualified under the instant background check. But there is no onus on a private seller to inquire about a buyer’s background, and no requirement that a purchaser disclose whether he or she is legally qualified to buy a firearm in Virginia.

What could change 
As Howell noted in her interview with Sharpton, the General Assembly has passed several bills this year affecting voting and gun purchases.

The major change in voting concerns what happens if voters don’t have identification when they show up at the polls on Election Day. Instead of signing an affidavit and having their vote counted immediately, anyone who can’t present ID would turn in a provisional ballot. Local electoral boards meet the day after the election to determine which of the votes are valid.

But this provision does not necessarily make voting tougher than buying a gun. You would have no hope of buying a gun from a licensed dealer if you did not present identification. And you still won’t need ID to buy a gun for a private dealer. So the comparison doesn’t change.

Legislators have also repealed a law limiting handgun purchases to one a month. Many exceptions have been put in the law since passed in 1993. But the repeal would not change the requirements for buying a gun in the first place, it will allow you to buy more each time you clear the hurdles.

Our ruling

Howell said it is becoming harder to vote in Virginia than buy a gun..

There are more restrictions on buying a gun from a licensed dealer than voting. The firearm purchase requires more identification. The gun buyer has to go through a background check that the voter does not. And you can be more easily disqualified from buying a gun than you can be from voting.

But there are fewer barriers to buying a gun privately than there are to voting. The private gun sale requires no wait, no identification, and no easily enforceable disqualifications",Half True,"February 27, 2012"
"""You can’t put a gun rack in a [Chevrolet] Volt.""","Republican presidential hopeful Newt Gingrich recently went gunnin’ for greenies.

Gingrich’s target is the Chevy Volt, an electric car that also can run on gas. During a recent Republican presidential campaign swing through Georgia, he revved up crowds by calling it the car that rich, liberal environmentalists think you ought to drive.

President Barack Obama would make you ditch your gas guzzler at the side of the road for the Volt, if he had his way, Gingrich warned.

""This is an administration that is deeply opposed to Americans having the right to choose the kind of car or truck they want to drive,"" the former Georgia congressman told a crowd in Cobb County on Saturday. ""And I keep trying to get across to my liberal friends: You cannot put a gun rack in a Volt.""

Slow down there, Mr. Speaker. You can’t put a gun rack in a Volt?

Is Gingrich taking us for a ride?

We realize this is not a pressing policy issue. And Gingrich was obviously trying to inject a little humor in what has been a demolition derby of a campaign.

But PolitiFact Georgia decided it was time for a little detour from our typical GOP primary coverage.

We set the Truth-O-Meter’s sights on Gingrich’s high-voltage claim.

We contacted the Gingrich campaign for a comment, but did not get a reply by the time this article went to press.

The Chevy Volt is a $40,000 electric car. The midsize sedan can travel about 35 miles on battery power alone, but if you need to go a few hundred miles farther, the gas tank kicks in.

To charge the Volt, you hook the battery to an orange cord stored under the trunk carpet. The other end plugs into an electrical outlet.

Chevy designed the Volt with so-called ""early adapters"" and green technology fans in mind, company spokesman Robert Peterson said. Owners tend to have high incomes and are concerned about the environment and U.S. energy dependence.

Chevy manufactures cargo nets, floor mats, a sunshade and an ashtray for the Volt, but nary a gun rack, Peterson said.

""It’s not something we normally consider,"" he said. He lent us a Volt for our fact check.

Car experts weren’t sure a gun rack would fit.

""You certainly CAN put a gun rack in a Volt, if you're talking about a tactical shotgun with a dash-mounted rack, as in a police cruiser,"" said Dan Neil, Pulitzer-winning car columnist and author of the ""Rumble Seat"" column in The Wall Street Journal. ""A window rack, like in pickups? No, that would be difficult.""

Gingrich took his gun rack quip on the road. He repeated it in Tulsa, Okla., on Monday before a crowd of 3,000 at Oral Roberts University.

We heard Gingrich say it again as we sat behind the wheel of a borrowed Chevy Volt, listening to the Sean Hannity radio show. We were hunting for a gun rack, and the Volt did its best to help. It started with the push of a button, and greeted us with a melody that sounded like a harp on Auto-Tune. A screen showed us the location of nearby stores.  

The Volt’s pearly center console glowed under buttons lit up in cobalt blue. We felt as if R2-D2’s younger, sexier brother was our co-pilot.  

Local gun store salesmen told us we could get a truck accessory store to customize a rack. We found a video online that showed a Volt owner rigging one up with plastic piping and plywood.

We don’t think these were what the former House speaker had in mind. PolitiFact Georgia opted to test products we could buy off the shelf. We returned to the newsroom parking lot with three gun racks and a stick as a gun stand-in.

The stick was a precaution. We didn’t want our co-workers to get the wrong idea. It was about 40 inches long, or roughly the length of a shorter shotgun.

The first contraption suspended guns on two racks behind the Volt’s seats. They hooked onto the car’s rear headrests and handily balanced the stick.

It was designed to fit two long guns.

The second used two camouflage neoprene slings to cradle up to two guns behind the car’s front seats. They fit, but not well. The slides of the Volt’s heated seats were in the way. We tied the slings’ bottom attachments to the front seat belt anchors instead.

That’s four long guns.

The third rack was designed to show off guns in the car’s rear window. The kit came with two plastic hooks with long adjustable bases. Each end was shaped like a wedge.

They fit snugly in the space between the upholstery and window, but were about 8 inches too short.

It was nothing that duct tape and PVC pipe couldn’t fix, but no self-respecting Georgian would display his guns that way. We checked online and found window racks that we think would work.

How do we rule?

Gingrich said you can’t put a gun rack in a Chevrolet Volt. We installed two gun racks that tote four guns combined.

"Says Barack Obama ""endorsed a total ban on the manufacture, sale and possession of all handguns.""","
Wayne LaPierre, a longtime leader of the National Rifle Association, says President Barack Obama is biding his time to destroy the Second Amendment.

The group’s executive vice president spoke for the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington on Feb. 10, 2012, arguing the president’s strategy has been to ""hide, shroud and cloak"" his anti-gun plans.

One piece of evidence for that hidden agenda against the right to bear arms, LaPierre said: ""(Obama) endorsed a total ban on the manufacture, sale and possession of all handguns.""

A @PolitiFact Twitter follower wanted to know: Really?

Flashback

Turns out, we’ve seen a similar claim before.

Back in 2008, the NRA said that then-Sen. Barack Obama had a 10-point plan to ""change"" the Second Amendment, including a ban on the manufacture, sale and possession of handguns.

We found it False, saying a ""fuzzy stand in ‘96 does not amount to a plan.""

This time, LaPierre said that Obama ""endorsed a total ban."" Does his wording make a difference?

Here’s the shred of truth behind LaPierre’s rhetoric: In 1996, Obama’s campaign for Illinois Senate filled out a questionnaire for a state voter group. (Maybe Obama did it; maybe his campaign manager did. A spokesman for his 2008 presidential campaign later said that staff ""unintentionally mischaracterized his position,"" and that he never saw the survey.)

The questionnaire asked about Obama’s stance on various issues, including, ""Do you support state legislation to … ban the manufacture, sale and possession of handguns?""

The typed answer: Yes.

(You can see the questionnaire here and here, and read stories about it by the Associated Press and POLITICO.)

Obama never endorsed a ""total ban."" But his campaign for state Senate almost 16 years ago did say yes to supporting such a ban on a state level in a questionnaire.

What came of the campaign endorsement of such a policy?

The Associated Press noted that Obama's legislative record in Illinois ""shows strong support for gun restrictions, such as limiting handgun purchases to one a month, but no attempts to ban them."" On a different questionnaire eight years later, Obama’s position was that ""a complete ban on handguns is not politically practicable"" but that reasonable restrictions should be imposed, AP reported.

The president’s policies

Has Obama’s presidential administration shown sympathy for banning handguns?

In 2009, FactCheck.org said, ""We’ve seen little or no evidence that the Obama administration is doing much to regulate guns or gun ownership.""

In 2010, the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence gave the president a report card of seven F’s for his first year in office, including on ""standing up the to the gun lobby.""

We talked with Caroline Brewer, director of communications for the Brady Center’s sister organization, the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence.

""We certainly don't have a record of him calling for a ban of any kind on handguns in the United States,"" she said. ""... There's no logical reason to believe the president would ever advocate the banning of all handguns, and we as organization don't advocate for that, either.""

She noted that after the Tucson, Ariz., shootings that injured former U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords, the president called for better background checks, not banning guns.

Here’s a quote from that Obama op-ed, as published in the Arizona Daily Star on March 13, 2011: 
(It’s true, by the way, that Obama repealed Reagan-era rules to keep loaded guns out of national parks, something else that didn’t sit well with the Brady Campaign.)

LaPierre argues Obama’s rhetoric is a sign that he’s biding his time until a second term, when he’ll unfurl his full anti-gun agenda — an uncheckable prediction. (See: ""Obama’s Secret Plan To Destroy The Second Amendment By 2016."") However, none of Obama’s previous years in office hint at the kind of extreme policy push the NRA claims he’s yearning to unleash.

Our ruling

LaPierre said ""(Obama) endorsed a total ban on the manufacture, sale and possession of all handguns."" Obama’s 1996 campaign for state Senate did endorse a state-level ban, on a questionnaire from which he has since distanced himself.

He never suggested such a law in office, and later questionnaires showed a more nuanced approach, as have his more recent statements on gun control, including those during his time in the U.S. Senate and as president. In fact, his gun-control agenda has earned him failing grades from a prominent gun-control advocacy group.

We can’t rule on a shadowy conspiracy to destroy the Constitution in Obama’s second term. But we can say that LaPierre’s claim that Obama endorsed a total ban on handguns contains a small element of truth (a typewritten ""yes"" on a long-ago questionnaire about a state ban) but ignores critical facts — that is, Obama's statements and record — that would give a different impression",Mostly False,"February 13, 2012"
"""The U.S. gun homicide rate is 20 times the combined rate of other western nations.""","
U.S. Rep. Jim Moran marked the first anniversary of the shooting of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords in Arizona with a call for more gun control.

""The U.S. gun homicide rate is 20 times the combined rate of other western nations,"" Moran, D-8th, wrote in a Jan. 10 column that ran in the Falls Church News-Press.

That statistic caught our eye. We wondered if Moran is right.

A Moran spokeswoman told us the congressman’s claim is based on a study of the homicide rates of wealthy nations in 2003, conducted by the UCLA School of Public Health. The report, published in 2010, uses data from the World Health Organization to compare gun-related homicide, gun-related suicide and unintentional and undetermined gun deaths for all ages and both sexes.

Vital statistics from the U.S. were compared to those from 22 other high-income countries with populations over 1 million people that reported causes of mortality to WHO for 2003. Researchers relied on The World Bank’s definition of a high income  nation, which included countries that had a gross national income per capita of $12,276 or more for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2011.

In addition to the U.S., the study included Australia, Austria, Canada, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom (England and Wales), United Kingdom (Northern Ireland) and United Kingdom (Scotland).

Researchers determined that the rate of homicides with guns in the U.S. was 4.1 per 100,000 people; the same rate combining the 22 other countries was 0.2 per 100,000 in 2003. The rate of homicides using guns in the U.S. was 19.5 times the rate of the other countries. Moran, rounding up, correctly repeated that factoid.

We decided to see if there were more recent numbers than 2003. U.N. and national statistics for those same countries showed the gap closed. The most recent data, mostly from 2009, shows a gun homicide rate of 3.0 per 100,000 people in the U.S. and 0.2 in the 22 other countries used in the firearm fatality study. The U.S., with its decrease, had a rate around 15 times those of other countries.

Next, we moved away from numbers for a second and examined the terminology Moran used in his column. It is imprecise.

The congressman wrote that the U.S. gun homicide rate is 20 times higher ""than other western nations."" But in fact, he was comparing them to them a selective group of wealthy nations. And not all them -- such as Japan -- are typically considered  a ""western nation.""

The term ""western nation"" is not listed in Webster’s New World College Dictionary and we found a range of definitions online.

Most commonly, the term is used to describe countries where Western Europeans have settled or have influence. We tried to come up with a list of such nations and settled on the 28 countries that are NATO members.

The most recent gun-related homicide rate for the U.S. was 3.0 per 100,000 compared to an 0.3 for the rest of the NATO nations. The U.S. rate was 10 times higher.

Our ruling:

Moran, calling for stronger gun regulations, wrote ""The U.S. gun homicide rate is 20 times the combined rate of other western nations.""

Moran used the right number from a report based on 2003 data. But the researchers did not claim to analyze ""western nations,"" they compared gun homicide rates in 23 ""populous, high income"" countries, including Japan.

If you compare the most recent data on the same group of nations, mostly based on 2009 statistics, the U.S. gun homicide rate is 15 times higher than the other countries. The number fell to 10 times as high when we defined the inexact term of ""western nations"" as countries belonging to NATO.

So Moran’s figures are outdated and on the high side. His terminology is loose. But his point -- that gun homicide rates in the U.S. tower over those of other wealthy  European nations -- holds up",Mostly True,"January 27, 2012"
Says Texas does not regulate the appearance of some kinds of imitation firearms sold in Texas.,"
A Democratic state senator called for regulations after police fatally shot a 15-year-old boy who was brandishing what turned out to be a non-lethal air pistol.

In an interview posted online Jan. 6, 2012, by KRGV-TV, Channel 5, Eddie Lucio of Brownsville said: ""First of all I think that there should be a prohibition of some kind on the appearance of these pellet guns and airsoft guns that are sold in the state of Texas."" At least, Lucio said, such guns should visibly stand out so ""we understand exactly what they are.""

In the same segment, reporter Eddie Flores said Lucio told him that ""right now, there are no known regulations or prohibitions in the appearance of pellet guns or airsoft guns in the state of Texas."" 
No regulations in Texas? 
When we inquired, Lucio’s legislative director, Sara González,said the senator intended to stress the lack of state, not federal, regulations of the facsimile firearms’ appearances.

Airsoft guns, she said, are required by federal law to display a 6-millimeter orange tip, a mandate that doesn’t apply to pellet or BB guns. ""What (Lucio) meant is there is nothing in the state that we know of,"" she said. ""There’s federal regulation on airsoft guns, but that doesn’t apply necessarily to metal pellet-type guns or BB guns.""

In the Jan. 4, 2012, incident at a Brownsville middle school, the student was wielding a Umarex SA177, according to news accounts. The device solely fires steel BBs, Justin Biddle, a marketing manager at Umarex USA, told us in an interview.

González helped us isolate the federal law that regulates the appearance of imitation firearms, stipulating the 6-millimeter orange marking requirement for airsoft guns. Those guns shoot projectiles at a lower speed than pellet or BB guns, according to Jeffrey Welty, an assistant professor of public law and government at the University of North Carolina School of Government, who specializes in criminal law and procedure.

But the marking requirement does not apply to ""traditional BB, paint-ball, or pellet-firing air guns that expel a projectile through the force of air pressure,"" the law says.

So, the gun used in Brownsville was exempt from federal marking requirements.

In the wake of the shooting, the office of Rep. Rene Oliveira, D-Brownsville, also examined legal issues related to facsimile firearms, said J.J. Garza, Oliveira’s chief of staff. Garza pointed us to another part of the U.S. Code, Section G, which states that federal provisions on imitation gun identification supersede such local or state laws and ordinances.

But are there state and local restrictions anyway?  

Meagan Dorsch, a spokeswoman for the National Conference of State Legislatures, emailed us the organization’s July 2011 list showing states with imitation firearm statutes:  Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York, Tennessee and Wisconsin.

We wondered how any state statutes survive without conflicting with the superseding federal law. By addressing aspects not included in the federal provisions, advised David Kopel, an expert on firearms policy and research director at the Independence Institute, a free-market think tank in Colorado. For instance, he said by email, ""Louisiana’s statutes only applies to guns that fire blanks, and those aren't covered by the federal law.""

Separately, experts at the Texas Legislative Library said that some Texas cities, including Plano, Horseshoe Bay, Farmers Branch and Carrollton have local ordinances that regulate how people display facsimile firearms--no reckless displays of imitation guns in public places, for example--but these statutes don’t regulate the appearance of the guns.

Our ruling

There are no state-level regulations of the appearance of pellet/BB or airsoft guns sold in Texas, but federal law requires airsoft guns to have special markings -- a wrinkle Lucio did not clarify",Mostly True,"January 24, 2012"
"""We haven't had any legislation which took away one gun in the past 20 years from anybody in this country--not one.""","
There’s another gun battle heating up in Congress that not only divides politicians on the right to bear arms, but to carry them across state lines without penalty.

And New Jersey Rep. Bill Pascrell (D-8th Dist.) doesn’t want that to happen.

During a Nov. 16 House hearing, Pascrell spoke against the proposed National Right-To-Carry Reciprocity Act of 2011. If H.R. 822 becomes law, states that allow people to carry concealed weapons would be required to recognize other states’ valid concealed carry permits. At least 40 states already have some form of reciprocity for out-of-state concealed carry permits. The bill has been referred in the Senate to the Committee on the Judiciary.

In opposing the bill, Pascrell said, ""We haven't had any legislation which took away one gun in the past 20 years from anybody in this country -- not one.""

Pascrell’s spokesman, Paul Brubaker said the congressman was specifically referring to federal legislation, noting that his ""point would have beeen clearer had he specified that he was referring to nonviolent, law-abiding gun owners.""

PolitiFact New Jersey found Pascrell’s argument somewhat on target.

But two gun-rights organizations we spoke with say two laws do take guns from people.

Larry Pratt, executive director of Virginia-based Gun Owners of America, and Joe Waldron, legislative director for the Washington state-based Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms, both said a provision of The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 banned semiautomatic weapons with detachable devices. That, in effect, takes a weapon away from someone who wants it, they said.

Brubaker disagreed.

""The 1994 federal assault weapons ban prohibited for 10 years the possession, transfer, and manufacturing of semiautomatic assault weapons and large-capacity ammunition feeding devices,"" Brubaker said in an email. ""However, there was a grandfather clause in the bill, and semiautomatic assault weapons that were legally-owned before the ban went into effect were NOT restricted. Those weapons could be transferred and sold within the confines of federal and state laws. … Neither the assault weapons ban, nor any federal prohibition of particular guns from being imported, resulted in the federal government taking legally-owned guns away from Americans.""

Waldron also pointed to The Domestic Violence Gun Ban, more commonly called the Lautenberg Amendment for its author, Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ). The amendment to the Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act of 1997 bans anyone convicted of a misdemeanor domestic violence offense from owning or possessing a firearm, even if the person had it before the conviction. The law requires that person to immediately surrender the weapon – but not necessarily to law enforcement.

That person’s gun and ammunition should be transferred  to a ""third party who may lawfully receive and possess them, such as their attorney, a local police agency, or a federal firearms dealer. In addition, such firearms and ammunition are subject to seizure and forfeiture,"" according to the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives website.

The result of the Lautenberg Amendment ""is that people have been disarmed of weapons within the past 20 years and they’ve been sent to prison when they’ve been caught in possession,"" Waldron said.

The consequences of one’s actions are central to the issue, according to ATF spokesperson Ginger Colbrun. As an example, she said that if a gun owner is convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence, the person’s actions are to blame for him no longer being allowed to possess a weapon -- not the law.

""It really is semantics when you look at it,"" she said.  
But the person still has to give up the gun and to some, that's taking it away.

Our ruling

Pascrell said there hasn’t been any legislation in the past 20 years that took a gun from anyone in the United States. Gun advocates disagree, pointing to the federal crime bill and the Lautenberg Amendment as examples. But the facts are a gun can't be taken from someone who never had it, and having to surrender a gun because of a misdemeanor domestic violence conviction can be construed as it being taken away",Half True,"January 9, 2012"
"""Ballistic tests have confirmed that the death of at least one U.S. Border Patrol agent was caused by"" weapons that were part of a federal arms trafficking operation.","The same day that U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder spoke at the LBJ presidential library in Austin, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst of Texas called for Holder's resignation in a post on his campaign website that pointed to the ""Fast and Furious scandal"" as the ""latest evidence that Holder is failing to perform his duties in a competent manner."" The Dec. 13, 2011, post said the federal government's ""walking"" of guns — into the hands of criminals and across the U.S.-Mexico border — had endangered people in both countries. ""Ballistic tests have confirmed that the death of at least one U.S. Border Patrol agent was caused by one of the DOJ-walked weapons,"" the post says, referring to the U.S. Department of Justice. We wondered whether Dewhurst, who is seeking the U.S. Senate seat to be vacated by Kay Bailey Hutchison, was right about what ballistics tests found. First, some background: Fast and Furious was a multi-agency federal arms-trafficking investigation that took place in Arizona from late 2009 to early 2011 and was led by the Phoenix office of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, an agency of the Justice Department. In the operation, agents allowed firearms to be illegally purchased in Arizona, with the goal of tracking at least some guns to Mexican drug cartels and eventually building a case against cartel leaders. Along the way, though, agents lost track of at least 1,300 guns — with some subsequently linked to crimes in Mexico and the United States, including the Dec. 14, 2010, slaying of Border Patrol agent Brian Terry in Arizona. Dewhurst's campaign did not respond to our requests for information supporting his campaign's claim that ballistics information confirmed Terry's killing by a Fast and Furious weapon. We reviewed news reports, congressional reports and public testimony, which indicated that two Fast and Furious guns were recovered from the scene of Terry's shooting. However, we found no federal ballistics information confirming that the bullet that killed Terry was fired from one of the guns. According to a press release from the U.S. attorney's office in Phoenix, Terry was shot during a firefight with a group of armed ""illegal aliens"" while on patrol with other agents in a canyon near Rio Rico, Ariz. — about 10 miles north of the border city of Nogales. The slaying helped push Fast and Furious into the national spotlight, and the operation is under investigation by the Justice Department's inspector-general, the U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa. Eleven months after the shooting, Holder told a Senate panel on Nov. 8, 2011, that ""any instance of so-called gun walking is simply unacceptable"" and that ""regrettably, this tactic was used as part of Fast and Furious, which was launched to combat gun trafficking and violence on our Southwest border."" Holder continued, telling the Judiciary Committee that ""this operation was flawed in its concept and flawed in its execution, and unfortunately we will feel the effects for years to come as guns that were lost during this operation continue to show up at crime scenes both here and in Mexico."" News organizations have widely reported that the two rifles found at the scene of Terry's slaying were part of Fast and Furious.

According to a July 21, 2011, Los Angeles Times article, ATF supervisors acknowledged in emails two days after Terry’s slaying that the guns were part of the botched operation. And according to a Sept. 11 Times story, the Phoenix ATF field office sent out an agency-wide bulletin the day after Terry’s death saying that the guns were Fast and Furious weapons. Separately, a June 14, 2011, report released by Grassley and U.S. Rep. Darrell Issa, a California Republican who leads the House oversight committee, includes a copy of a Dec. 15, 2010, ATF email that says: ""The two firearms recovered by ATF this afternoon near Rio Rico, Arizona, in conjunction with the shooting death of U.S. Border Patrol agent Terry were identified as 'Suspect Guns' in the Fast and Furious investigation."" Grassley has offered yet more support for the link, through news releases, written statements prepared for congressional hearings, and direct questioning of administration officials. A digital collection of documents on the senator's website includes a copy of a Justice Department email dated Dec. 17, 2010, to Gary Grindler, then the acting deputy attorney general. The email notes that a border agent was killed in Arizona earlier that week and says two weapons recovered from the scene had been linked to Jaime Avila Jr., ""a straw firearms purchaser that ATF and USAO (U.S. attorney's office) for Arizona have been investigating since November 2009 as part of its larger Fast and Furious operation."" During the November 2011 hearing, Holder did not dispute the statement, repeated frequently by senators, that the guns at the scene of Terry's slaying were part of Fast and Furious. However, in response to a question from Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, about whether he had apologized to Terry's family, Holder said that it's unfair ""to assume that the mistakes that happened in Fast and Furious directly led to the death of Agent Terry."" He did not elaborate. So, it appears to be undisputed that two Fast and Furious guns were present at Terry's killing. And what of the ballistics testing? The only information we found about ballistics testing and Terry's death was an FBI report completed shortly after the shooting. The report, dated Dec. 23, 2010, says that the bullet that killed Terry could have been fired from the kind of guns that were found at the scene but that ""firearms examinations"" could not determine if the bullet came from either of the found weapons. The report — posted online July 26, 2011, by the Times and described in a story the next day — says the bullet ""was fired from a barrel rifled with four grooves, right twist, such as the K2 and K3 rifles"" — the guns found at the scene. ""However,"" the report says, ""due to a lack of sufficient agreement in the individual microscopic marks of value, it could not be determined if the … bullet was fired from the barrel of the K2 or K3 rifles."" Neither the FBI nor the U.S. attorney's office in San Diego, which is handling the Terry case, would comment to us about ballistics tests. Finally, we talked with the House oversight committee and Grassley's office. Becca Watkins, a spokeswoman for committee Chairman Issa, told us that the Times' reporting about the FBI report was accurate, although she said the committee is waiting for the Justice Department to respond to requests for more information. ""The ballistics report for the guns recovered at Agent Terry's crime scene do not rule out the Operation Fast and Furious guns as the weapon in his death,"" she said. But she suggested that it wasn't accurate to say that the report confirmed one of them was responsible for his death. At a Dec. 8, 2011, hearing of the House Judiciary Committee, U.S. Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, asked Holder whether the department had ""identified the weapon that actually killed Agent Terry."" Holder replied that he was ""not prepared to talk about that"" because the investigation is ongoing. Our ruling By all accounts, Fast and Furious weapons were found at the scene of a U.S. agent's death. Dewhurst's campaign was emphatic, though, that ballistics tests confirmed that the weapons killed the agent. We found no information indicating that's so",False,"January 8, 2012"
"Enacting the Right-to-Carry Act would amount to ""expanding the rights of sex offenders, terrorists, child predators, and abusers to carry concealed weapons across state lines.’’","
U.S. Rep. David Cicilline, a Democrat from Rhode Island and former mayor of Providence, has joined current mayors of cities around the country to fight a gun-permit bill pending in Congress.

The National Right-to-Carry Reciprocity Act (H.R. 822), sponsored by U.S. Rep. Clifford Stearns, R-Fla., would require all states to recognize out-of-state permits for carrying concealed weapons.

The House approved the bill 272 to 154 on Nov. 16, 2011. Cicilline and Rep. James Langevin, also a Democrat from Rhode Island, both voted against it. The bill is before the Senate Judiciary Committee. (A similar measure was narrowly defeated in the Senate in 2009.)

Federal law restricts who can own or possess a firearm, and bans possession by anyone convicted of a felony. But the rules for getting a permit to carry a concealed weapon vary from state to state.

Nine states, including Rhode Island, don’t recognize out-of-state gun permits, according to Mayors Against Illegal Guns.

In a Nov. 18 fundraising letter e-mailed to constituents, Cicilline attacked Republicans and ""Tea Partiers"" for supporting the Right-to-Carry bill.  

""Earlier this week, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives -- with the enthusiastic support of Sarah Palin, Texas Governor Rick Perry, and the Tea Partiers -- once again turned their backs on the 14 million unemployed Americans in our country,"" the letter says, ""and instead chose to focus their efforts on expanding the rights of sex offenders, terrorists, child predators, and abusers to carry concealed weapons across state lines.""

Sex offenders? Terrorists? Child predators and abusers?

""I told you: you wouldn’t believe it,"" the letter continues.

Actually, we weren’t sure what to believe. So we decided to check it out.

The facts

We focused on the second part of the statement: ""expanding the rights of sex offenders, terrorists, child predators, and abusers to carry concealed weapons across state lines.’’

The phrase ""expanding the rights’’ suggests that these criminals currently have the right to carry concealed weapons. But do they?

Cicilline and his staff offered numerous examples, both hypothetical and real, to argue that, under the bill, criminals in each of the four categories could legally carry a concealed firearm into a state such as Rhode Island, which would amount to ""expanding their rights.""

We checked what they offered and will summarize our findings, looking at the categories separately.

Domestic abusers

Under federal law, anyone convicted of a crime of domestic violence, including misdemeanors, or anyone subject to a court restraining order cannot legally own or possess a firearm.

Cicilline’s staff provided us with information from Mayors Against Illegal Guns about four cases (in Missouri, Idaho, Florida and Pennsylvania) in which domestic abusers were granted concealed weapon permits and went on to commit murder.

In three of the cases (those from Florida, Idaho and Missouri), authorities failed to enforce the federal law banning domestic abusers from possessing weapons, according to the summaries provided. In none of those cases did the abusers have the right to carry concealed weapons. So the Right-to-Carry Act can’t expand a right they don’t have.

But in the Pennsylvania case, our research confirmed that the killer was granted a concealed weapons permit, despite a prior restraining order for domestic abuse. There were nothing to prohibit the state from granting the permit because the restraining order had been withdrawn.

So in the domestic abuse category, one of the four examples that Cicilline’s staff provided -- the Pennsylvania case -- supports his claim that some people with a record of domestic abuse can legally carry a concealed weapon.

Child predators

Adults who sexually prey on children are prohibited by federal law from owning or possessing firearms if they have been convicted of a felony.

And sex crimes against children are almost always felonies.

But the term ""child predator,"" Cicilline’s staff said in a follow-up e-mail, speaks more broadly about crimes that ""lead up to or are related to child molestation.’’
misdemeanor
They referred us to laws regarding sex-crimes against minors in states such as Florida, Georgia and New Hampshire, where there are no laws preventing such criminals from getting concealed weapon permits.

We believe that some of the examples Cicilline’s staff provided, including a Georgia law that makes unwanted sexual touching of a 16-year-old a misdemeanor, stretch the meaning of the term ""child predator.""

But in New Hampshire, an adult who lures a child into engaging in sex for pornography -- a misdemeanor in that state -- is clearly a child predator.

So that example met the test.

Sex offenders

Federal law prohibits sex offenders convicted of felonies from owning or possessing firearms.

But Cicilline’s staff noted that someone convicted of a misdemeanor sex offense involving another adult would not automatically be barred from getting a concealed weapon permit in some states.

In New Hampshire, for example, it’s a misdemeanor for correctional officers to engage in sex with someone over whom they have authority.

Ann Rice, a New Hampshire deputy attorney general, said conviction for such a crime would not automatically bar someone from getting a concealed weapon permit.

In this category, we verified that the type of case cited by Cicilline’s staff supports his statement.

Terrorists

Federal law bars anyone arrested, charged or convicted of acts of terrorism from owning or possessing a firearm. The Right-to-Carry bill clearly would not expand their rights.

But Cicilline and his staff offered a broader definition of ""terrorist"" to support the congressman’s claim.

They said people convicted under  state terrorism laws, adopted in several cases after the Sept. 11 attacks, and people on the federal government’s terrorist watchlist could be considered ""terrorists"" or ""suspected terrorists."" 
(In his fundraising letter, Cicilline uses the terms interchangeably, twice referencing ""terrorists"" and once ""suspected terrorists."" In the statement we checked, he said ""terrorists."")

First, let’s look at the state ""terrorism"" laws. Examples provided by Cicilline’s staff include a ""terroristic threatening"" statute in Kentucky that makes it a third-degree misdemeanor to threaten to seriously injure someone or to cause substantial property damage.

We confirmed that someone convicted of ""terroristic threatening"" in Kentucky could, indeed, be eligible for a concealed weapon permit after three years. Florida has a similar statute, though it’s never prosecuted anyone under it.

But are they ""terrorists"" as one would commonly understand the term? We don’t think so.

Now, let’s consider people on the terrorist watchlist.

During a conference call, Cicilline said there are ""thousands of people engaging in terrorism"" who have never been convicted of any act of terrorism or other offenses that would disqualify them from possessing a firearm. And in states with lax gun permitting laws, he said, these ""terrorists"" can and do get concealed weapons permits

So, if the Right-to-Carry bill becomes law, he reasons, they could legally bring their concealed weapons into Rhode Island.

In addition, Cicilline and his staff referred us to a May 2010 report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office citing FBI data that showed that individuals on the watchlist were involved in firearm or explosives background checks 1,228 times from 2004 through 2010.

The GAO found that 91 percent of those transactions were allowed to proceed because no felony convictions or other disqualifying factors were found.

The GAO expressed concerns that ""there was no basis to automatically prohibit a person from possessing a firearm or explosive because the person’s name appeared on the terrorist watchlist,"" Eileen R. Larence, director, Homeland Security and Justice at the GAO, said in an e-mail.

But being on the terrorist watchlist isn’t the same as being a terrorist.

It turns out there were more than 400,000 unique names and over 1 million entries on the terrorist watchlist at the end of 2009, according to The Washington Post. The list at one time mistakenly included the late U.S. Sen. Ted Kennedy, whose name was later removed.

So, under the Right-to-Carry Act, it’s possible that people on the terrorism watchlist could legally carry a concealed weapon in states where they currently cannot.

Does that mean that the rights of ""terrorists"" would be expanded? Again, no because they are not necessarily terrorists.

What about Cicilline’s argument that, for the purposes of determining who has the ""right"" to a carry a concealed weapon, there is no real distinction between a terrorist and a ""suspected terrorist""?

We believe there is a distinction. Otherwise, the more than 400,000 people named on the terrorist watchlist in 2009 could have been considered terrorists.

(It’s worth noting that among the more than half-dozen cases of shootings Cicilline’s staff provided to back up his claims, none involved a state legally granting a concealed weapons permit to a convicted terrorist, or to someone who, at the time, was a terrorism suspect.)

In this category, we concluded that the examples cited by Cicilline’s staff were based on an overly broad definition of ""terrorist"" and did not support his claim.

Our ruling

Cicilline said the Right-to-Carry bill would expand rights of ""sex offenders, terrorists, child predators, and abusers to carry concealed weapons across state lines.""

In three categories -- sex offenders, child predators and abusers -- we agreed that in some narrow exceptions involving misdemeanor crimes, his statement was true.

But we found that his statement didn’t meet the test on the fourth. To apply the ""terrorist"" label to all 400,000 people on the government’s watchlist, or to those convicted of a misdemeanor ""terroristic"" threat, is, at best, an exaggeration.  

Further, by saying the Republicans ""chose to focus their efforts"" on expanding the gun rights of ""sex offenders, terrorists, child predators, and abusers,"" he implied, with a heavy dose of hyperbole, that this was their intent",Half True,"January 1, 2012"
Says Mitt Romney flip-flopped on an assault weapons ban.,"
On Nov. 28, 2011, the Democratic National Committee released two videos designed to paint Republican presidential candidate and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney as a serial flip-flopper. The shorter, 30-second version gives a taste of the attack, specifically citing abortion and health care, and directs viewers to a website with a four-minute version that offers alleged flip-flops on a variety of other issues. 
For this item, we’ll check one of the claims from the four-minute version -- specifically, whether Romney has changed his position on an assault weapons ban. We're looking at other aspects of the ad in separate items. 
Here’s the relevant portion from the DNC ad: 
Screen text: For assault weapons ban 
Video clip of Romney speaking: ""I just signed a piece of legislation extending the ban on certain assault weapons."" 
Screen text: Against assault weapons ban 
Video clip of Romney speaking: ""I do not support any new legislation of an assault weapon ban nature."" 
We previously ruled Mostly True a charge by Republican candidate Jon Huntsman that Romney flip-flopped on gun control. But Huntsman’s charge was broader than the DNC’s, so we’ll take a look specifically at Romney’s views on assault-weapons bans. 
Using supporting material provided by the DNC, we went to the sources of both clips in the ad. The first clip came from the Aug. 4, 2004, edition of the Fox News program Hannity and Colmes. That interview was conducted roughly halfway through Romney’s single term as governor of Massachusetts. The second clip came from a Republican presidential debate held on Jan. 24, 2008, in Boca Raton, Fla. By then, Romney had left the governor’s office and was running for president. 
Upon reviewing this material, we find that the DNC’s choices for the specific quote and counter-quote in the ad are problematic. But we also found that other evidence not cited in the ad provides support for the notion that Romney has taken muddled positions on Second Amendment issues. 
The Massachusetts bill 
As we evaluate this claim, it’s important to know that when he was governor, Romney signed legislation that extended an existing assault weapons ban in Massachusetts. 
The 2004 bill enacted a permanent ban on assault weapons -- reportedly the first such state law in the country. ""These guns are not made for recreation or self-defense,"" the Boston Globe quoted Romney as saying at the time. ""They are instruments of destruction with the sole purpose of hunting down and killing people."" 
Despite the assault-weapons provision -- usually a deal-breaker for gun-rights groups -- the measure received support from pro-gun groups because other provisions lengthened the terms of firearm ID cards and licenses to carry firearms. On more than one occasion, Romney described the bill as a ""consensus"" measure. 
The 2004 interview 
Now, let’s look at the full context of the clips shown in the DNC ad. 
In the Hannity and Colmes clip, guest co-host Pat Halpin asked Romney about the existing federal assault weapons ban, which was then on a path to expiring due to intentional Republican inaction. ""So are you in favor of that ban being extended or do you want to see it lapse?"" 
Romney responded, ""I believe the people should have the right to bear arms, but I don't believe that we have to have assault weapons as part of our personal arsenal. … In my state I just signed a piece of legislation extending the ban on certain assault weapons in our state."" 
Halpin continued to prod. ""Governor, would you like to see that extended again on the federal level, as well?"" she asked. 
Romney replied, ""It very well may be. In our state what we did is we got both sides of this issue to come together, because we relaxed a number of things, allowing people who hadn't been able to get weapons in the past to be able to purchase those. … There are hunters in the NRA and the gun owners' action league (who) backed the legislation that said, ‘Look, let's protect our citizens from dangerous assault weapons, but let's also make … regular weapons more available to our citizens.’ And we made a compromise that works."" 
Our takeaway is that Romney, at that moment, was arguing that ordinary Americans have the right to bear some types of arms but not assault weapons. He said it ""very well may be necessary"" to extend the federal assault-weapons ban, while adding that he acted on the state ban because it also included expansions on other types of gun ownership rules. 
The 2008 interview 
Fast-forward to the debate in 2008, when fellow Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee challenged Romney on his views about gun control. Huckabee asked, ""Do you support the assault weapon ban? And (what is) your position on exactly what restrictions government should put on Second Amendment rights?"" 
Here’s Romney’s full response: 
""I do support the Second Amendment. And I believe that this is an individual right of citizens and not a right of government. And I hope the Supreme Court reaches that same conclusion. 
""I also, like the president, would have signed the assault weapon ban that came to his desk. I said I would have supported that and signed a similar bill in our state. It was a bill worked out, by the way, between pro-gun lobby and anti-gun lobby individuals. Both sides of the issue came together and found a way to provide relaxation in licensing requirements and allow more people to have guns for their own legal purposes. And so we signed that in Massachusetts, and I said I would support that at the federal level, just as the president said he would. It did not pass at the federal level. I do not believe we need new legislation. 
""I do not support any new legislation of an assault weapon ban nature, including that against semiautomatic weapons. I instead believe that we have laws in place that if they're implemented and enforced, will provide the protection and the safety of the American people. But I do not support any new legislation, and I do support the right of individuals to bear arms, whether for hunting purposes or for protection purposes or any other reason. That's the right that people have."" 
If you look closely, the DNC ad quoted one portion of Romney’s statement -- ""I do not support any new legislation of an assault weapon ban nature, including that against semiautomatic weapons"" -- that seemingly contradicted his support for the 2004 assault-weapons ban extension. But the DNC ad could just as easily have quoted portions of the statement that were consistent with Romney’s 2004 position -- specifically, that he ""would have signed the (federal) assault weapon ban,"" and that he ""signed a similar bill in our state."" 
The reality is that Romney’s answer in the debate was unfocused, even self-contradictory. He said that he would have signed a federal assault ban extension -- but he added that after it failed on the federal level, he felt he did not believe new legislation was necessary. 
Our ruling 
The DNC ad has some problems. It uses some deceptive editing, and it ignores the fact that Romney was pretty consistent in both of the comments to frame his support for an assault-weapons ban in the context of a compromise that also expanded other types of gun rights. 
The difficulty of analyzing this charge is that Romney's position on an assault-weapons ban in the 2008 debate was so muddled that it's hard to pin down whether he actually flip-flopped. It's more an example of an internal inconsistency than a flip-flop per se. In fact, the DNC might have made a more convincing argument simply by quoting the confilcting parts of Romney’s 2008 debate comment. 
So the DNC made some procedural missteps, but it's on to something about Romney's delicate dance on gun control",Half True,"November 29, 2011"
"A Republican-led softening of firearms training rules means that ""untrained individuals"" would be allowed to carry guns with a state permit.","
The latest turn in Wisconsin’s long path to becoming the 49th state to allow carrying concealed weapons featured a Republican attorney general watching helplessly as Republican lawmakers tossed out several specific firearms training rules he drew up.

When the smoke cleared, Democrats protested that GOP lawmakers went too far by eliminating a set amount of safety training (four hours) and instructor-signed proof of graduation from a firearms course before a permit could be issued.

""Suspending these requirements is an abuse of power that will endanger the lives of Wisconsinites across our state,"" said state Rep. Donna Seidel, D-Wausau,  the Assembly’s assistant minority leader.

Her Nov. 7, 2011, statement continued: ""This would allow untrained individuals to carry guns into public spaces where children are present, but rather than protect Wisconsin’s children, Republicans chose to pay off their friends in the gun lobby with another gift.""

We knew Attorney General J.B. Van Hollen argued the changes could make it tougher to prove fraud by firearms course instructors and students.

But would people without any training at all be able to get a state permit?

We asked Seidel to back up her claim, and her office pointed to Van Hollen’s testimony at the hearing before a legislative rules committee. In Madison, legislators write laws, which prompt agencies to pen specific rules to carry out the Legislature’s intent. A joint legislative committee reviews the rules and has the power to alter them.

Let’s start with Van Hollen’s written testimony and his oral remarks on the rules and the changes, as well as documents on the Department of Justice website.

He spoke shortly before the panel: 
Van Hollen said the rewrite of his rules, sought by the National Rifle Association, would make Wisconsin’s law among the most lenient among states that require permits. PolitiFact Wisconsin found the same thing in our reporting on an earlier item on the training requirements.

States typically do one or more of the following: certify the training organization, their instructors or their courses; mandate specific topics for training; set a minimum number of hours; require the instructor to sign the training certificate.

Wisconsin now requires none of those.

The requirement to get an instructor-led safety course and provide a graduation certificate is still in effect, but Van Hollen told lawmakers the changes would ""effectively gut"" the training requirement because proving fraud would be next to impossible.

The law, with the rules changes, is too vague to determine whether applications meet any meaningful standard, he said.

""We can create as many laws as we want, but if we don’t have the ability to prove and prosecute them, they’re meaningless,"" Van Hollen said.

""In a very real sense,"" Van Hollen wrote in written testimony, ""an individual who has been certified by a ‘national or state organization’ could stand on the street corner and after a short conversation on firearm safety could hand out certificates for a fee.""

The state would risk legal challenges if it denied applications because only vague and subjective training criteria are left, he said.

So what was the bottom line? Did Van Hollen say untrained individuals could slip through?

He told the committee: ""In essence, we will accept every application at face value without determining whether substantive and meaningful training has occurred.""

He concluded: ""If the four-hour training requirement is removed from the statute and rules as they exist today, that effectively eliminates our ability to screen applicants … to determine whether anybody actually really met a training requirement or not."" Van Hollen said his office would be forced to be ""very liberal"" in approving permits.

Legal experts concurred that Van Hollen would be in a difficult spot if he tried to reject applications based on questions about meeting the ill-defined training requirement.

Former Wisconsin Attorney General Peg Lautenschlager said Van Hollen is probably correct that if he denies applications based on questionable training that the state would get sued. And could well lose, she added.

""I think he was left without anything to enforce,"" Lautenschlager said.

Speaking generally about the appropriate role of an attorney general dealing with lawmakers, Jim Tierney, a former Maine attorney general, said: ""This is an attorney general doing his job. You have to keep the elephants inside the ring. You have the constitution and due process and procedures that have to be followed. It’s an essential part of democracy.""

Finally, we spoke to Jim Franklin, executive director of the Minnesota Sheriffs Association. In that state, county sheriffs investigate and issue permits for concealed carry. The state law, in contrast to Wisconsin’s, requires safety instructors to submit their courses to the state for certification. The average course is 4 to 6 hours. The instructors have to sign off. The course curriculum is laid out by the state.

We asked Franklin whether he could evaluate applicants’ training without those requirements in the law.

""It would be much more difficult,"" he said. ""It would be not impossible but certainly more difficult. We negotiated these things to avoid many of those pitfalls and strengthen the confidence of the public that good checking is going on.""

Our conclusion

Seidel said a Republican-led weakening of firearms training rules means that ""untrained individuals"" would be allowed to carry guns with a state permit. As support, she cited comments by Van Hollen.

We found his comments, at the very least, strongly suggest that people faking the training could still get permits. Others back up Van Hollen’s assertion that he would be in a weak position, and it’s clear Wisconsin’s rules would be among the most lenient among states requiring permits.

The law is still on the books requiring an instructor-led training course, but it’s hard to prove that someone skipped it. So the door is open to ""untrained"" individuals getting a permit",True,"November 21, 2011"

Among other things, the John Birch Society holds seminars around the country to oppose Agenda 21, a United Nations program it says ""seeks for the government to curtail your freedom to travel as you please, own a gas-powered car, live in suburbs or rural areas, and raise a family.""

The society is also warning of a little-noticed measure pending in the Wisconsin Legislature, Assembly Bill 237.

In an article critical of the bill that was posted on its website Nov. 4, 2011, the group said that under the bill, ""minor offenses such as violating pet leash laws, seat belt laws, parking infractions, etc., would now be arrest-able offenses.""

Handcuffs and jail for letting a dog run loose, failing to buckle up or parking improperly?

Let’s find out.

To support its claim about the bill -- which passed one Assembly committee, 9-0, on Oct. 25, 2011, and is waiting to be scheduled for a vote by the full Assembly -- the society’s article cited two things: The bill’s language and a list of offenses that would become ""arrest-able.""

The one-sentence bill simply says law enforcement officers ""may arrest a person for a law violation that is punishable by a civil forfeiture.""

The word arrest indicates the claim by the John Birch Society is on the right track. Indeed, the claim suggests the arrests allowed under the bill would be a dramatic change from the status quo.

An analysis by the state Legislative Reference Bureau doesn’t elaborate much on the bill, which was introduced by Rep. Joel Kleefisch, R-Oconomowoc, husband of Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch.

But a memo from the state Legislative Council, which provides legal and other research services to the Legislature, said the bill provides law enforcement officers ""additional arrest authority"" for state civil forfeitures -- non-criminal offenses prohibited by state law.  

The bill is needed mainly for two reasons, said Joel Kleefisch’s research assistant, Stephanie Kundert: to provide uniform enforcement around Wisconsin of state forfeitures, which are punishable by a fine; and to protect law enforcement agencies from lawsuits like one filed against the Brookfield Police Department in suburban Milwaukee.

In that case, a Milwaukee woman was arrested at gunpoint in July 2010 after attending a Brookfield church service while wearing a holstered handgun. The woman, assisted by the Wisconsin Carry gun-rights group, filed a federal civil rights suit, which the City of Brookfield settled in January 2011 by paying her $7,500.

One legal claim the woman made was police had no legal authority to arrest her and that helped expose the need for the Kleefisch bill, said Brookfield Assistant Police Chief Dean Collins, who is the main promoter of the bill.

By way of background, Collins, who served more than 30 years in the Milwaukee Police Department, pointed out that state law already gives police the power to make arrests under three sets of circumstances: 
For felony and misdemeanor crimes. 
For local ordinance violations, such as a dog at large. 
For traffic offenses, including parking violations or failing to wear a seat belt. 
So, despite what the John Birch Society claim suggests, a dog at large is already an arrest-able offense in communities that have such an ordinance; and failing to wear a seat belt and parking violations are among traffic violations that already are arrest-able offenses statewide.

But, ironically, no state law gives officers the power to enforce state forfeitures.

""It’s a void in the law and it was just not noticed for many, many years,"" Collins said at an Oct. 19, 2011 public hearing on the bill.

The Kleefisch bill -- endorsed by state associations that represent Wisconsin’s police chiefs, sheriffs and district attorneys -- is needed so officers can enforce state forfeitures, such as the one that prohibits dogs at large, in communities where no such local ordinance exists, Collins said.

More importantly, he said, the bill would give legal authority for officers statewide to enforce more serious state forfeitures that are not covered by local ordinances.

In a letter to lawmakers, Collins cited a number of offenses many would consider serious: 
The list also include offenses that might be considered less serious: trespassing on private property; sending unsolicited faxes; fireworks violations; body passing at sports events; improper use of laser pointers and refusal to pay bus fare.

Haven’t police and sheriff’s deputies already been enforcing such things?

Kundert said many police agencies have been doing so for many years, even though they lack explicit legal authority. Officers investigate a state forfeiture violation and report it to the county district attorney. In turn, the district attorney can file an action in Circuit Court that can result in a person being ordered to pay a fine.

Collins predicted that if the Kleefisch bill does not become law, some law enforcement agencies will stop taking action for state forfeitures for fear of being sued like Brookfield was. Wisconsin Carry, which opposes the bill, says it ""vastly expands police authority"" and won’t legally protect police agencies that make arrests like Brookfield did in the gun case.

A final point before we conclude.

Collins stressed that the word arrest has broad meaning in the law. An arrest can involve being handcuffed and put in jail; but legally a person is under arrest just by being detained and questioned by an officer, he said.

Our conclusion

The John Birch Society said that under a bill pending in the Legislature, ""minor offenses such as violating pet leash laws, seat belt laws, parking infractions, etc., would now be arrest-able offenses.""

Dog at large violations are already arrest-able in communities that have such ordinances and seat belt and parking violations are arrest-able statewide -- though the arrest typically does not involve handcuffs or jail, but rather a person being detained or perhaps ending up with a fine.

The bill would make numerous state forfeitures arrest-able. But that would simply give legal authority for something officers already doing -- detaining and sometimes referring to prosecutors people suspected of violating non-criminal state laws.

The John Birch Society statement is partially accurate but leaves out important information",Half True,"November 14, 2011"
"""People are five to seven times more likely to be murdered in workplaces that allow firearms than in those that prohibit it.""","
Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker’s support of concealed carry gave his critics, some of whom want to recall him from office in 2012, another reason to slam him.

On Oct. 30, 2011, two days before the concealed carrying of guns and other weapons became legal in Wisconsin, one visitor to a Facebook site that bashes Walker took a shot at the Republican governor and the law. She posted this statement from the Wisconsin Anti-Violence Effort Educational Fund:

""People are five to seven times more likely to be murdered in workplaces that allow firearms than in those that prohibit it.""

Concealed carry has drawn high interest from gun owners -- more than 80,000 application forms for permits were downloaded by 9 a.m. on the first day the law took effect -- and from people who fear more gun carrying will lead to more violence. So we decided to check WAVE’s statement.

In becoming the 49th state to legalize concealed carry, Wisconsin generally allows people age 21 and over to carry hidden handguns, stun guns, most knives and other weapons. But there are restrictions, including some that apply to workplaces.

Owners and occupants of property can prohibit concealed carry on or in the property. And employers can prohibit employees from carrying concealed weapons while on the job.

WAVE, which describes itself as the ""only statewide grassroots organization solely dedicated to reducing gun violence, injuries and deaths,"" has been pushing businesses to post signs prohibiting concealed carry on their premises. It has made the claim that people are five to seven times more likely to be murdered in workplaces that allow firearms to tens of thousands of people through its website, emails and direct mail, said executive director Jeri Bonavia.

The claim, she said, is based on a May 2005 article in the American Journal of Public Health, which publishes peer-reviewed scientific research.

The article was written by researchers from the University of North Carolina’s Department of Epidemiology and Injury Prevention Research Center. We also found an earlier article on the same study, which appeared in another research publication, the American Journal of Epidemiology.

The researchers examined 152 homicides that occurred in 143 workplaces in North Carolina from January 1994 through March 1998. They concluded that workplaces where guns were permitted ""were five to seven times more likely to be the site of a worker homicide relative to those where all weapons were prohibited.""

So, the researchers said workplaces that allowed guns were five to seven times more likely to be the site of a homicide. In contrast, WAVE said people are five to seven times more likely to be murdered in workplaces that allow firearms.

We asked Stephen Marshall, one of the researchers, whether WAVE’s wording was an accurate expression of what his study found; he simply reiterated the phrasing used in the study.

We put the same question to other researchers; some said they thought WAVE’s statement was an essentially accurate expression of what the study found, while others thought WAVE’s wording was problematic.

But there’s a more important question in terms of whether WAVE’s claim is accurate: Does the study’s major finding -- North Carolina workplaces that allowed guns were much more likely to be the site of a homicide -- apply to other states, including Wisconsin?

Marshall said one could not assume that the five-to-seven-times statistic from his study would be true for Wisconsin or any other place.

Other experts, however, gave a range of answers on whether the finding of the North Carolina study is applicable to Wisconsin workplaces.

Applicability unknown: Susan Gerberich, co-director of the Regional Injury Prevention Center at the University of Minnesota, said that because the study was limited to North Carolina, it is not known whether the increased risk of workplace homicide would be true in other places.

Corinne Peek-Assa, director of the University of Iowa Injury Prevention Research Center, said ""generalizing epidemiologic studies is never simple.""

And Mary Vriniotis, research specialist with the Harvard Injury Control Research Center, said: ""This study provides good evidence that workplaces allowing firearms increase the risk of workplace homicide,"" but ""it's hard to say whether the findings in Wisconsin would be the same.""

Applicability possible: Epidemiology professor Sabrina Walsh of the University of Kentucky Injury Prevention and Research Center said it is possible the higher workplace homicide risk found in North Carolina would be true in other states.

And Stephen Hargarten, director of the Medical College of Wisconsin Injury Research Center, said the North Carolina study should be cause for concern in Wisconsin that workplace homicides would occur more often in workplaces that allow guns than in those that don’t.

Applicability likely: Daniel Webster, co-director of the Johns Hopkins University Center for Gun Policy and Research, said that although the five-to-seven times statistic found in the North Carolina wouldn’t automatically apply to other states, ""I don’t have any reason to think you’d have radically different findings"" if the North Carolina study were replicated in Wisconsin.

All the researchers said they were not aware of any other study like the one done in North Carolina.

Our conclusion

Citing a university study, the Wisconsin Anti-Violence Effort said: ""People are five to seven times more likely to be murdered in workplaces that allow firearms than in those that prohibit it.""

Some experts faulted WAVE -- though others didn’t -- for using different wording than the study itself, which said North Carolina workplaces that allowed guns were five to seven times more likely to be the site of a homicide.

Some experts said they could not conclude from the North Carolina study whether the higher likelihood of workplace homicide would be true in other places like Wisconsin. But other experts said the North Carolina study was proof that the workplace homicide rate in Wisconsin likely would be at least somewhat higher in workplaces that allow guns compared to workplaces that don’t.

In sum, WAVE’s statement is generally accurate, but leaves out important details, such as that the study applied only to North Carolina",Half True,"November 7, 2011"
Says Mitt Romney flip-flopped on gun control.,"
Former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman uses a wind-up monkey to make fun of Mitt Romney for flip-flopping in a new  Web ad.

In another item we checked whether the ad's claim that Romney had flip-flopped on abortion was accurate. In this one we're checking the claim that he has switched his position on gun control. 
In one side-by-side video comparison, the ad shows video of Romney first saying, ""We do have tough gun laws in Massachusetts. I support them,"" and then saying, ""And I would protect our Second Amendment rights to bear arms.""

Clearly, the ad is charging Romney with flip-flopping on gun control. So we decided to see whether the charge is accurate.

First, let’s look at some of the things Romney has said about gun control.

• In 1994, when he was challenging Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy, Romney supported two gun control measures -- the Brady Bill, which required background checks for gun purchases, and a ban on certain types of assault weapons. Both were strongly opposed by most gun-rights advocates.

In a July 1994 question-and-answer session with voters arranged by the Boston Herald, Romney ""reaffirmed"" his support for both measures, the newspaper said. ""I don't think (the waiting period) will have a massive effect on crime, but I think it will have a positive effect,"" Romney said.

In a subsequent interview published on Sept. 23, 1994, Romney said, ""I don't want special-interest groups making this their campaign. I don't want their money. I don't want their help. This is my race."" In the interview, Romney specifically mentioned gun-rights advocates, acknowledging that his stands on the two gun-control measures would put him at odds with such groups.

""That's not going to make me the hero of the NRA,"" he said, referring to the National Rifle Association. ""I don't line up with a lot of special interest groups.""

• Then, in his 2002 race for governor, Romney said during a debate against against Democrat Shannon O'Brien, ""We have tough gun laws in Massachusetts; I support them.""

Fast-forwarding to the present, we couldn’t find much on Romney’s 2011 positions on gun control. The issues section of his website has nothing about it, and the one time the topic came up in a debate -- an attack by Texas Gov. Rick Perry on Sept. 22, 2011, in Orlando, Fla. -- Romney didn’t take the bait. Perry said, ""I think Americans just don't know sometimes which Mitt Romney they're dealing with. Is it the Mitt Romney that was on the side of against the Second Amendment before he was for the Second Amendment?"" But Romney instead chose to respond to Perry’s subsequent charge about his position on health care.

So we turned to statements Romney made during the 2008 presidential campaign, when he ran unsuccessfully for the GOP nomination.

• Addressing a group of National Rifle Association members by video on Sept. 10, 2007, Romney said, ""Let me speak very directly and candidly about where I stand. I support the Second Amendment as one of the most basic and fundamental rights of every American. It's essential to our functioning as a free society, as are all the liberties enumerated in the Bill of Rights."" He repeated that message later that month at a meeting of the National Shooting Sports Foundation.

• In a candidate questionnaire published by the Washington Post during the 2008 primary campaign, Romney said this:

""Q: Do you think gun control has an impact on crime rates in the United States?""

""Romney: The Second Amendment protects the individual right of lawful citizens to keep and bear arms. I strongly support this essential freedom, and I applaud the recent federal appeals court decision in Washington, D.C., which concluded that the Second Amendment protects an individualized right to keep and bear arms. As president, I will support that interpretation and protect the right of every law-abiding American to keep and use firearms. With respect to gun control laws, I believe we need to distinguish between law-abiding gun owners and criminals who use guns. Those who use a firearm during the commission of a crime must be punished severely. The key is to provide law enforcement with the resources they need and punish criminals, not burden lawful gun owners.""

""Q: Do you think tighter restrictions should be in place for those buying a firearm?""

""Romney: No. I believe we need to focus on enforcing our current laws rather than creating new laws that burden lawful gun owners. I believe in safe and responsible gun ownership, and that anyone who exercises the right to keep and bear arms must do so lawfully and properly. I do not believe in a one-size-fits-all federal approach to gun ownership because people keep and use firearms for different reasons. Law-abiding citizens have a right to protect their homes and their families and as president, I will vigorously defend that right.""

• According to the Boston Globe, Romney appeared on an Internet podcast, ""The Glenn and Helen Show,"" and said that he hoped states would ease regulations on gun owners. He also expressed enthusiasm for guns and hunting. ""I have a gun of my own,"" he was quoted as saying. ""I go hunting myself. I'm a member of the NRA and believe firmly in the right to bear arms.""

• On the Oct. 21, 2007, edition of CBS’ Face the Nation, host Bob Schieffer challenged Romney on the evolution of his gun-control position.

Schieffer said, ""You once said, ‘We do have tough gun laws in Massachusetts, I support them, I won't chip away at them. I believe they protect us.’ Now you say you are a gun owner. You have joined the National Rifle Association, after saying at one point, ‘I don't line up with the National Rifle Association.’ Why would you join that group?""

Romney began by stating that he had the endorsement of the National Rifle Association during his run for governor, a claim he later had to back away from. He continued, ""I support the NRA. I support Second Amendment rights, but I don't line up 100 percent with the NRA. They take some positions that are different than mine. But my positions are the same as my positions have been with regards to guns for a long, long time, and that is that I respect the right of people to bear arms, and whether that's for hunting or personal protection. ...""

It’s worth noting that between his 1994 and 2002 campaigns and the 2008 presidential campaign, Romney served a four-year term as governor of Massachusetts, during which he signed a major firearms-related bill.

A bill he signed in 2004 enacted a permanent ban on assault weapons -- reportedly the first such state law in the country. ""These guns are not made for recreation or self-defense,"" the Globe quoted Romney as saying. ""They are instruments of destruction with the sole purpose of hunting down and killing people.""

Despite that provision -- usually a deal-breaker for gun-rights groups -- the measure received support from pro-gun groups because other provisions lengthened the terms of firearm ID cards and licenses to carry firearms. The Globe reported that during the 2008 campaign, Romney described the bill as a ""consensus measure"" and a ""positive step.""

Our ruling

The evidence largely supports the contention that Romney has flip-flopped on gun rights, particularly in his tone. Romney’s message during the 1994 and 2002 campaigns was that he was a strong supporter of gun control measures, while in the 2008 president campaign, he played up his pro-Second Amendment credentials and actively sought support from the National Rifle Association and other gun-owner groups.

Substantively, the gap -- at least as of the 2008 campaign -- was somewhat narrower. He’s been vague about specific legislation he’d support, and in the interview with Schieffer, Romney acknowledged that ""I support Second Amendment rights, but I don't line up 100 percent with the NRA. They take some positions that are different than mine."" Still, between his early campaigns and his 2008 presidential run, Romney does appear to have shifted his views",Mostly True,"November 2, 2011"
"Wisconsin’s concealed-carry permit rules demand more proof than other states that safety training requirements are met, rendering ""all existing (training) certificates insufficient"" as part of the permit application","
Firearm-rights advocates were thrilled in July 2011 when Wisconsin passed a concealed-carry law described as the fifth-best in the U.S. from their viewpoint. At the time, the state was one of only two that did not allow people to carry concealed weapons.

But folks on both sides of the expressed concerns while awaiting detailed rules on how to get a permit.  The law takes effect Nov. 1, 2011.

The NRA was upset at rumors that Wisconsin’s Department of Justice would require live-fire training and mandate at least four hours of safety instruction overall. Meanwhile, critics feared that online video courses might be deemed enough to get a permit.

Some of those rumors were unfounded -- permit applicants need not fire a gun (as in Minnesota), and training must be face-to-face with a certified instructor. The four-hour length was approved, though, in the emergency rulesissued by Wisconsin Attorney General J.B. Van Hollen.

Nevertheless, despite the specific rules that drew criticism from gun advocates, Wisconsin’s overall law is still in the Top 10 for ease of access to permits, according to Nik Clark, head of Wisconsin Carry Inc., a nonprofit gun-rights organization.

Something little discussed in the back-and-forth was the fact that applicants can get permits even if their training was years ago.

And that’s where the National Rifle Association comes in. The NRA remains unhappy about an issue related to proving an applicant has received past training.

In a lobbying alert to its members on Oct.15, 2011, the group’s legislative arm said the state Justice Department overstepped by requiring too much information on the certificates needed as proof of firearms safety training.

""No training certificates anywhere in the country contain the information that the Wisconsin DOJ demands,"" the NRA alert said. ""This renders all existing certificates insufficient for submission with a citizen’s license application.  DOJ could have easily established a system that would have allowed existing training certificates to be submitted while ensuring that the requirements of the concealed weapons law are met.""

The NRA contends some would-be applicants will be discouraged, or will not be able to track down their instructors to get the required proof (for instance, if an instructor died or moved away). It argues in those cases applicants will have to get retrained because of DOJ’s ""demands.""

What are those demands, and are they unique to the Wisconsin rules?

The NRA could not provide a state-by-state comparison to back up its claim, so we did a brief survey of states based on governmental and private research. We also interviewed firearms safety trainers.

So let’s get armed with some facts.

We will not focus on what proof is needed in the case of military, law enforcement or security firearms training, or hunter education courses. The dispute is over proof of training run by groups such as the NRA and other state and national organizations.

In that case, the DOJ rules require: 
  

Based on our check of permit rules around the country, it’s not hard to find states that require some of the same things Wisconsin requires.

We learned of certificates of training that required confirmation of the course length (Missouri); the instructor’s name and signature (Michigan, Florida, Minnesota); and a statement attesting to the course meeting state law (Michigan) -- the same things Wisconsin requires.

And it’s not hard to find states that seek similar items -- Utah requires instructors to stamp the application, for instance.

On the other hand, we could find no state that required all of what Wisconsin is seeking. The instructor contact information, in particular, is unusual on the graduation certificate. Some states -- not including Wisconsin -- directly certify instructors and their courses, giving them access to the same information.

""You’re on your own over there,"" said Gary Shade, of Shade’s Landing, a personal protection and firearms training company in Apple Valley, Minnesota.

In addition to Shade, we spoke with Bill Schmitz, of BDJ, Ltd. in Redgranite, Wis.; Tim Grant, of American Association of Certified Firearms Instructors; and Michael Bender of the Personal Protection Academy in Madison. All said they would have to re-do their certificates because of the Wisconsin rules.

Some complained about it; others said it was no big deal.

The proof requirements directly affect NRA trainers, who along with instructors from other organizations will have to re-work and re-issue their graduation certificates to meet the specific Wisconsin rules, our research found.

This summer, after the law passed but before Van Hollen’s rule came out in October, some people jumped the gun and got trained with less than four hours of instruction or got trained through online courses, according to our interviews with several training companies.

Others got enough training but were handed certificates that don’t include all the required information. There is time and expense involved for trainees and instructors in going back at this.

Van Hollen says the rules are reasonable and an anti-fraud move.

""The DOJ’s requirements for training certificates allow instructors to verify that the permit applicant named on the certificate actually took the course,"" DOJ spokeswoman Dana Brueck told us. ""Given the Legislature required ‘proof’ of training, it only makes sense to have the instructor sign the document.""

Brueck said the course location verifies the training was face to face.

A final point:

We found that evaluating the NRA assertion that ""no training certificates anywhere in the country contain the information that the Wisconsin DOJ demands"" is a matter of how you read the statement.

Does the group mean nobody else asks for ""any"" of the information Wisconsin does, or that, taken as a whole, no other state seeks all of what we do? NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam said it was the latter.

Our conclusion

The NRA claimed that ""no training certificates anywhere in the country contain the information that the Wisconsin DOJ demands.""

We found elements in common with what other states require, as well as some that appear to be unique to Wisconsin’s rules on certificates. We think it’s reasonable to interpret the NRA claim as meaning no other state asks for as much as we do on the certificate, so that part of the statement is basically accurate with some clarification.

The group also said the DOJ rules render all existing graduation certificates ""insufficient for submission with a citizen’s license application.""

There’s ample evidence that is true for courses run by organizations such as the NRA. The NRA’s overall point is a technical one, but requires some clarification",Mostly True,"October 31, 2011"
"""You are prohibited from walking into the Capitol with a gun, but you can go after the County Commission or the School Board.""","
In the old days, before Oct. 1, 2011, when folks headed to the beach or a park in some Florida cities, local laws forbade them from strapping a gun to their bathing suit or bringing it along in the picnic basket.

But in the wake of the deadly shooting in Tucson, Florida legislators during the 2011 legislative session took up a slew of pro-gun laws and one -- House Bill 45 -- made it loud and clear that it's up to the state, not each individual city or local government, to set firearm laws. And that means holders of concealed weapons permits are free to bring that gun along with the sunblock and sandwiches to a local or state park.

State law doesn't allow permit holders to bring their guns everywhere -- in fact there's a long list that shows everywhere guns aren't allowed including: 

• ""Any meeting of the governing body of a county, public school district, municipality, or special district;""
• ""Any meeting of the Legislature or a committee thereof;""
• ""Any school, college, or professional athletic event not related to firearms;""
• ""Any elementary or secondary school facility or administration building."" 
• ""Any place where the carrying of firearms is prohibited by federal law.""

State Rep. Jim Waldman, D-Coconut Creek, who voted against House Bill 45, wants his home county of Broward essentially carved out of the law, so he plans to file a bill to ban carrying guns in many local government buildings in Broward County. 

In an Oct. 24 posting on the political blog browardbeat.com, Waldman said: ""You are prohibited from walking into the Capitol with a gun, but you can go after the County Commission or the School Board. It is the height of hypocrisy.""

Waldman's words drew more than a dozen comments from readers and these caught our eye:

""Jimbo is wrong. It’s legal to bring your gun into the Capitol. It’s illegal to bring it into the chamber, hence the 2nd metal detectors before you enter…""

""Maybe Jim should file a bill to allow guns into the Capitol, instead. Let’s see how the gun nuts go for that.""

We wanted to check Waldman's claim: Is it illegal to walk into the Capitol with a gun but visitors can pay a visit to the County Commission or School Board with a loaded weapon?

Waldman's bill and House Bill 45

First, a word about Waldman's proposed bill, which was in the process of being drafted as of Oct. 27. Waldman's bill would make it illegal to carry a handgun or concealed weapon or firearm within certain government buildings in Broward including the Broward County Governmental Center, the school district's administration building and one building in each city designated by city commissions. Violators would face a second-degree misdemeanor.

Broward County has suggested an even broader ban to include additional county sites and Broward's state legislative delegation will have to decide how to proceed on both proposals. (A political aside: a bill tightening gun restrictions from Broward's mostly Democratic legislative delegation will face an uphill battle in Republican-dominated Tallahassee. But we're checking Waldman's facts here -- not his odds.)

House Bill 45, which generally prohibits local governments from regulating firearms, passed the House 85-33 on April 26, 2011, and the Senate 30-8 on April 28 and was approved by Gov. Rick Scott June 2. The law allows judgments of up to $100,000 against local governments that enforce such laws, and local officials could be fired and fined $5,000.

As the law was set to take effect Oct. 1, cities began eliminating ordinances that banned guns from parks or other places. 

Guns at the Capitol
  
Waldman said, ""You are prohibited from walking into the Capitol with a gun...""

In short, he misfired.

PolitiFact Florida asked the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, which oversees the Capitol Police, to explain what HB 45 means with respect to gun-toting visitors at the Capitol.

""Effective October 1 (as a result of passage of HB 45), concealed weapons permit holders may bring firearms into the Capitol,"" spokeswoman Heather Smith wrote in an e-mail. ""Upon entry, Capitol Police will check that the individual has a permit to carry a concealed firearm. Capitol Police will also provide a written notice that advises them that they are prohibited from entering rooms where the Legislature is in session or in committee. If requested, we do have the ability to temporarily store those firearms (on a limited basis). Prior to HB 45, only sworn law enforcement officers could bring firearms into the Capitol."" 

There are metal detectors to get into the Capitol and the public galleries of the House and Senate but not committee rooms, Smith said. 

So that means a person with a valid concealed weapons permit can bring a gun to meet with Rep. Waldman in his office -- but not to watch him vote or speak in the House chamber or during a committee meeting. So Waldman was wrong when he said you can't walk into the Capitol with a gun.

Guns and the School Board/County Commission
  
What about the rest of Waldman's claim: ""...but you can go after the County Commission or the School Board.""

State statute 790.06  lists where you can't bring a gun including any meeting of a governing body of a county, public school district or city as well as to any school event not related to firearms, or school facility or administration building.

So clearly the statute says you can't bring a gun to a county commission or school board meeting. But could you bring a gun to a commissioner's office?

Kraig Conn, an attorney with the Florida League of Cities which fought House Bill 45, said he has gotten about 50 phone calls or e-mails from cities and counties as they struggle to interpret the law. Some may interpret the law to mean permit holders are only forbidden from carrying their guns into the actual room where the commissioners are meeting while others may interpret it to mean that guns are forbidden in city hall -- period.

""If I'm a city attorney, I'm thinking I really don't want my elected city officials, or administrators, to be charged with a violation, and I would interpret this to mean you can bring your gun if you have a concealed weapons permit but you absolutely cannot have access to the meeting room,"" Conn said. ""If it's a small city hall and there are not a bunch of other offices in it, I'm going to go out on a limb and say you can't bring the gun in the building at all while there’s a meeting."" 

Broward assistant county attorney Tricia Brissett wrote in an e-mail that the statute means visitors can't carry a firearm into a county commission meeting but wouldn't answer if visitors could carry guns into areas of county buildings where commissioners aren't meeting. Broward has taken down signs that announced a gun ban -- a clue that the county isn't interpreting the law to mean a total prohibition on guns at the county's administration building. 

Miami-Dade County interprets the law to mean permit holders can't bring a gun into the county commission meeting, Miami-Dade assistant county attorney Jess McCarty said. But the gun-holder can bring the gun to meet with the mayor in his office.

Any clarification of the law won't occur until the Legislature takes it up again or there are legal challenges, Conn said.

Waldman's explanation 

In an interview with PolitiFact Florida, Waldman said his statement was wrong. 
  
""I'm not sure if what was quoted was exactly what I said. I probably didn't say it artfully enough. You can't go into chambers or a committee meeting where we are meeting, where legislators are,"" with a gun, he said. ""We protect ourselves but we don't protect our staff. That is the hypocrisy I was talking about. .... You can bring a gun if you have a concealed weapons permit into a Capitol building.""
  
We were still confused because Waldman's proposed bill doesn't address protecting staff who work at the Capitol -- it's about gun access at local government buildings such as county hall and the school district.

""Administration areas of the school board and county commission are not protected, that's what I was trying to say,"" Waldman said. ""I didn't say it very clearly I have to admit that.""

But the law does clearly say that guns are prohibited at ""any elementary or secondary school facility or administration building."" So we asked Waldman, why include Broward's school administration building in his bill?

Waldman interpreted the law to mean guns aren't allowed in administration facilities within schools -- not the administration building itself.

Buddy Nevins, the reporter who writes browardbeat.com, told PolitiFact that he quoted Waldman accurately. ""He did not qualify it himself,"" Nevins said.

Waldman said: ""You are prohibited from walking into the Capitol with a gun, but you can go after the County Commission or the School Board."" On the first half of the sentence Waldman spoke too broadly -- permit holders can walk into the Capitol with a gun but can't carry that gun into a meeting of the House or Senate. And it's clear that you can't carry a gun into a meeting of the county commission or school board but at least some government attorneys interpret the law to mean you can carry your gun into a commissioner's office at city or county hall",Mostly False,"October 27, 2011"
"Congressional Republicans have introduced dozens of bills on social issues and other topics, but ""zero on job creation.""","
A reader recently sent us a post circulating on Facebook and on blogs that blames the House Republican majority for focusing their legislation on lots of topics -- except for job creation. Here’s the text of the chart:

""The numbers: Republicans have introduced 44 bills on abortion, 99 on religion, 71 on family relationships, 36 on marriage, 67 on firearms/gun control, 522 on taxation, 445 on ‘government investigations,’ and zero on job creation.""

It cites as its source a post on the liberal website Daily Kos written on Oct. 21, 2011, by Minnesota-based blogger and self-described ""unrepentant liberal"" Myles Spicer,

""Given that these Representatives were elected to pass job creation bills so needed by our country, what has the House been doing this past year?"" Spicer asked in his post. ""Well, mostly they have occupied themselves with a variety of social, moral and value issues. ... The Congressional Research Service (CRS, a non-partisan arm of Congress that tracks such things) offers an appalling look at our current Congress’ activities.

""They have introduced 44 bills on abortion (one just the other day reaffirming existing legislation on this subject). 99 on religion. 71 on family relationships. 36 on marriage. 67 on firearms and gun control. 552 on taxation—and though most were to reduce taxes, there have been no significant changes on tax law with all time invested and bills introduced. And finally a massive 445 bills on ‘government investigations.’ There is a category labeled ‘job creation legislation’ originated by Congress, and tracked by the CRS. In that category the CRS reported: ‘No bills at this time. The Congressional Research Service has not tagged any bills in the current session of Congress with this issue area.’  If ever the analogy of ‘rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic’ was apt, this is it!""

We wondered about the accuracy of the post based on Spicer’s argument, so we took a look.

We didn’t find anything about legislative subject headings at CRS’ own website, but we did find a list of subjects for current legislation at THOMAS, the legislative-tracking website run by the Library of Congress.

Using THOMAS, you can search bills that have been offered during the current Congress -- the 112th -- by their CRS subject matter. The list of subject areas begins in alphabetical order here.

When comparing the numbers, we allowed for some variation due to the list being continuously updated as new bills are introduced. That said, we found that the numbers in the Internet post were quite close to what was listed in THOMAS for abortion, religion, family relationships, marriage, firearms, taxation and government investigations.

What about ""job creation""? As it turned out, we couldn’t find a topic area by that name at all.

We located Spicer and asked him for his sourcing. He told us he had used the website opencongress.org, a non-profit, non-partisan database of legislative and other congressional data. He pointed us to this page, where a category of bills categorized under ""job creation"" is listed. ""Job creation"" had zero entries.

We quickly noticed two things about the database. First, the numbers cited on opencongress.org for the social issues and other topics in the chart were close to what THOMAS had -- in other words, they closely followed the CRS subject headings. And second, ""job creation"" was only one of many, many topics that had zero bills associated with it in the opencongress.org database.

We reached David Moore, executive director of the Participatory Politics Foundation, which runs opencongress.org. He said that his website displays not only CRS issue labels used for bills pending in the current Congress but also labels that have been used at least once in the past three Congresses, even if none have been applied yet to bills in the 112th Congress.

By Moore’s count, opencongress.org includes 4,795 issue areas in all. But only a fraction of these subject headings have any bills listed under them, because CRS has not tagged any bills with those headings during the current Congress.

We did not hear back from CRS or THOMAS, so we don’t know why CRS has used the ""job creation"" label in the past but not this year.

However, our research suggests that the lack of bills labeled ""job creation"" this year doesn't mean there have been no bills aimed at promoting employment introduced in the current Congress.

Why? The House version of President Barack Obama’s American Jobs Act -- which we’re sure the president and his supporters would characterize as a ""job creation"" bill -- doesn’t even get slapped with that subject heading.

The bill -- officially H.R. 12, introduced on Sept. 21, 2011, by Rep. John Larson, D-Conn. -- is listed under no fewer than 68 separate subject headings, including ""aviation and airports,"" ""Buy American requirements,"" ""electric power generation and transmission,"" ""Internet and video services,"" ""metals,"" ""solid waste and recycling"" and ""water use and supply.""

But it doesn’t carry the label ""job creation.""

Instead, several closely related subjects have been applied to H.R. 12, including ""economic development,"" ""economic performance and conditions,"" ""employee hiring,"" ""employment and training programs,"" ""labor and employment,"" ""unemployment"" and ""wages and earnings.""

And how many bills have been introduced under these other headings? Here’s the list. (Some bills may be included in more than one category.)

Economic development: 64 bills
Economic performance and conditions: 55 bills
Employee hiring: 24 bills
Employment and training programs: 172 bills
Labor and employment: 151 bills
Unemployment: 107 bills
Wages and earnings: 143 bills

In reality, then, six of these seven jobs-related categories included more bills than either abortion or marriage, and four of the seven included more bills than religion, family relationships or firearms.

We see a few additional problems with the post.

It’s wrong to say that only Republicans sponsored bills on social issues, taxation and government investigations.

For every legislative subject cited in the ad, the THOMAS list includes bills introduced both by Republicans and Democrats. We checked each topic area to make sure that Democrats had offered bills on those topics, and in each case, they did. So it’s wrong for the post to say that ""Republicans have introduced"" that many bills. Both parties have. (Spicer, to his credit, did not make this mistake; the creator of the subsequent post did. ""When I state that these folks were elected to get us more jobs, I did not exclude the Democrats,"" Spicer told PolitiFact.)

It’s wrong to point to this data as evidence that Republicans are going hog wild on ""government investigations.""

To be sure, Republicans are using their control of House committees to probe government operations, including potential corruption and scandals. (The Democrats did the same after 2006 when they controlled Congress and George W. Bush was in the White House.) But it’s wrong to suggest that the 445 ""government investigation"" bills amount to evidence in support of this tendency.

Most of the bills tagged with this category are there because they contain some sort of oversight mechanism, such as defining who will oversee a newly created federal program and how. So most of these bills involve run-of-the-mill government oversight mechanisms, not an effort to gin up high-profile administration scandals.

Keep in mind that these categories are very broad.

Labeling a bill with a subject category doesn’t mean the bill is primarily about that issue. For instance, a very, very large number of congressional bills have some impact on the tax code, even if it’s tangential. That’s why so many bills get categorized as being tax-related.

To one degree or another for the other, this pattern holds for subject headings, too. The ""religion"" category doesn’t just include bills of interest to conservative Christians, as someone reading the post might assume. It also includes the ""Noose Hate Crime Act of 2011,"" sponsored by Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas and the ""Veterans, Women, Families with Children, and Persons With Disabilities Housing Fairness Act of 2011,"" sponsored by Rep. Al Green, D-Texas.

""Job creation"" means different things to different parties.

Most conservatives today are dead-set against traditional forms of government-based economic stimulus known as Keynesian economics, primarily spending initiatives. So if ""job creation"" is defined to primarily include Keynesian initiatives, then Republicans aren’t going to be sponsoring any ""job creation"" bills. Instead, Republicans argue that tax cuts and budget cutting will help the economy prosper.

Our ruling

While congressional Republicans have certainly introduced dozens of bills on social issues and other topics, the  claim that the GOP has focused on issues other than job creation just isn't supported. The numbers cited in the post include Democratic bills, and the definition of what constitutes a ""job creation"" bill is open to significant debate.

But the post’s most important flaw is the contention that Republicans have offered ""zero"" bills on job creation. This number stems from a methodology that also excludes Obama’s American Jobs Act from the category of ""job creation"" bills. If  you look at alternative job-related subject headings, the number of bills offered by lawmakers from both parties actually exceeds most of the social-issues listed in the blog post",False Pants on Fire,"October 25, 2011"
"Says ""if you are shot in the city of Newark, you have over an 80 percent chance that you've been arrested before an average of 10 times.""","
Many gun violence victims in the state’s largest city share a common trait -- a criminal history, according to Newark Mayor Cory Booker.

Booker, in a recent radio interview, said statistics showing the extent to which shooting victims are involved in the criminal justice system are ""startling.""

""We now sat down with Rutgers and have shown that if you are shot in the city of Newark, as the shooting demonstrates that we just saw, if you are shot in the city of Newark, you have over an 80 percent chance that you've been arrested before an average of 10 times,"" Booker said Oct. 13 on WBGO’s ""Newark Today,"" just days after a daytime shooting spree in a public housing complex in Newark’s Central Ward. ""So we know the players here. If you are getting shot or doing the shooting, overwhelmingly you've been involved in the criminal justice system and the correctional system is not correcting.""

PolitiFact New Jersey was also startled by the data. So, we researched Booker’s claim.

Newark spokeswoman Anne Torres said Booker’s ""statement should have been shot and killed, instead of shot,"" but beyond that he’s right.

The statistics come from a study Anthony Braga, a professor with Rutgers-Newark School of Criminal Justice is conducting, as a program called ""Operation Ceasefire"" is implemented in Newark.

David Kennedy, director of the Center for Crime Prevention and Control at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York, along with Braga and Anne Piehl, a Harvard professor at the time, implemented Ceasefire in Boston in 1996, with the city’s police department. The strategy aims to reduce gun violence through targeted law enforcement efforts, social services outreach and community interaction.

Though Braga’s study is not yet completed or published, Braga said he briefed Booker and his staff on the progress of his research on homicides and nonfatal shootings in the city.

""The exact numbers are... 85% of 165 murder victims in Newark between 2009 and 2010 were known to the criminal justice system before they were killed (""known"" meaning that they were arrested at least once before the homicide event),"" Braga wrote in an email. And those ""victims, had, on average, 10 prior arrests on their criminal records.""

Braga said he determined those figures by running the names and dates of birth of the homicide victims through the state’s database of criminal history files.

Kennedy said that pattern of violence is not unique to Newark. ""This is the way the streets work,"" he said. ""The idea that ordinary people kill each other is nearly never true.""

""The folks who pick up a gun and kill another human being are the exception, even within an active criminal population and they almost always kill people in their same social networks. So they’re killing each other, in effect. Contrary to what a lot of people think, this stuff is not random. It’s not stranger on stranger,"" said Kennedy. ""It’s people that know each other.""

Booker said ""if you are shot in the city of Newark, you have over an 80 percent chance that you've been arrested before an average of 10 times.""

"""We had (a bill) in Florida where we now are prohibiting doctors to talk -- particularly pediatricians -- to talk to their patients about gun safety in the home.""","
Former Florida Democratic governor and U.S. Senator Bob Graham says current Gov. Rick Scott is upending years of progress in the state created by both Republicans and Democrats, and his abysmal poll numbers are evidence that Floridians don't like it.

Appearing on MSNBC's Hardball program on June 1, 2011, Graham said Scott is ""out of the mainstream of Florida."" (Scott's current approval rating is 29 percent, according to a Quinnipiac University poll.)

""Remember, Florida has had Republican governors for the last 12 years. We have had Republican Legislatures for most of that time. And now we have a supermajority Republican Legislature,"" said Graham, who appeared on the show with former Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland, also a Democrat. ""So when the governor vetoes a budget and describes -- or line-item vetoes -- and describes things as frivolous and not in the public interest, he is not pointing at Democrats. He is pointing at his own party.""

""What happened with these Republicans?"" Matthews asked. ""People wanted to see some restraint on spending. They're worried about the economy. And these guys went in there and picked up on the old Republican agenda of labor bashing, of going after public employees -- I guess they are going after the trial lawyers next -- just the old Republican agenda that they could have done (in) any administration, and they are just out of touch with the people. What do you think, Governor Graham?""

Graham answered.

""Chris, I think you are absolutely right that what the people are really concerned with today are jobs and those things that are going to contribute to long-term economic well-being, such as an investment in education, protecting our environment,"" he said. ""And these governors have gotten off onto a very bizarre agenda of issues. We had one in Florida where we now are prohibiting doctors to talk -- particularly pediatricians -- to talk to their patients about gun safety in the home. That's how far out of the mainstream our state government has gotten.""

The talk about a gun bill passed in Florida got laughter from Matthews, and then this response: ""Gun safety is a no-no, huh? You can't talk about that even with mothers.""

Because it was a focal point in the interview, we wanted to see if it was true.

About the gun bill

We've written about the bill in question, HB 155, twice before. The bill passed the Legislature and was signed into law by the governor on June 2. 
The original version of the bill created a firestorm -- and fodder for national television -- because it sought to punish doctors with imprisonment or fines up to $5 million for asking a patient or a patient's family about gun ownership and gun habits. House sponsor Rep. Jason Brodeur, R-Sanford, said the bill was drafted partly as a reaction to American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines, which encourage physicians to counsel parents on creating a safe home environment and offering advice to avoid preventable accidents. The recommendations include mainly innocuous tips like ""Keep plastic bags and balloons away from your children,"" and ""NEVER place an infant in front of an air bag."" Physicians also are encouraged to tell parents to remove guns from places where children live and play.

In another case, Brodeur said an Ocala woman was turned away from her pediatrician after she refused to say whether she owned a firearm.

The multimillion-dollar fines and possible prison time were stripped from the bill, and the final language was watered down as part of a compromise between the Florida Medical Association and the National Rifle Association.

Under the bill that ultimately passed:

* Health care providers cannot enter gun ownership information into a patient's medical record ""if the practitioner knows that such information is not relevant to the patient's medical care or safety, or the safety of others.""

* Health care providers cannot ask questions to patients or their families about whether they own a gun, unless the provider ""believes that this information is relevant to the patient's medical care or safety, or the safety of others.""

* Health care providers cannot discriminate against patients because they own firearms.

* Health care providers should ""refrain from unnecessarily harassing a patient about firearm ownership during an examination.""

The penalties for violating the new rules could cost a doctor his or her license. Or they could face a fine up to $10,000.

While the Florida Medical Association supported the legislation, other groups of doctors -- including pediatricians remained in opposition, saying the law violates the free speech rights of doctors and ""also deprive patients of potentially life-saving information regarding safety measures they can take to protect their children, families and others from injury or death resulting from unsafe storage or handling of firearms."" (A group of doctors has since said they plan to sue over the law).

But the question for this fact check is whether the bill prohibits doctors from talking to their patients about gun safety in the home, as Graham said.

The answer is not explicit. The law prohibits -- in many cases -- a doctor from asking their patient or their family if they own a firearm. But the bill does not prevent doctors from discussing firearm safety.

So a pediatrician could counsel patients that if they own a gun, they should keep it stored away from small children. But they couldn't specifically ask if the patient owned a firearm, unless a doctor believed the information was relevant to the patient's medical care. They also could not ""harass"" a patient about gun ownership, according to the law.

The law doesn't define ""harassing"" or detail scenarios when a doctor is allowed to ask about gun ownership -- and that has some doctors worried.

""The law would virtually guarantee that some health care professionals who are simply following established protocol by informing patients of the lethal risks of firearms will be brought before a disciplinary board if a patient categorically objects to any discussion or inquiry on the subject of household firearms,"" attorney Bruce Manheim wrote in a letter to Scott urging his veto on behalf of the Florida Chapters of the American Academy of Pediatrics, American Academy of Family Practitioners and the American College of Physicians. ""Consequently, beyond imposing express prohibitions on protected speech, the legislation is also so vague, and its sanctions are so severe, that health care professionals will be chilled from freely engaging in speech with their patients.""

Graham said in an interview with PolitiFact Florida that the chilling effect generated by the bill could stop doctors from even talking about guns. ""I'm a hunter, have guns, etc., but I don't think you need to deny parents professional information about how to keep their children safe,"" he said. ""This law is an over-extension of what constitutes proper respect for people's Second Amendment rights."" 
Graham also had us speak to a Tallahassee pediatrician who has been fighting the law, Dr. Louis St. Petery. 
St. Petery told us that pediatricians have a long list of potential hazards they want to discuss with patient's families. That's why asking if a gun is important, because it helps focus discussions during the limited time doctors and families have. 
As a result of this law, St. Petery said pediatricians will withdraw from asking about or discussing guns. That will result in an increase in gun-related injuries and deaths, he said. 
""Sen. Graham is 100 percent correct,"" St. Petery said. 
Brodeur, the bill sponsor, provided the counter argument. He said HB 155 ""doesn't prevent the safety conversation at all,"" in a posting on Twitter.

Our ruling

On MSNBC's Hardball, Graham said the Florida Legislature had passed a bill ""prohibiting doctors to talk -- particularly pediatricians -- to talk to their patients about gun safety in the home.""

The bill doesn't go that far.

HB 155 creates restrictions for doctors wishing to ask their patients (or families) if they own a gun, and says health care officials should ""refrain from unnecessarily harassing a patient about firearm ownership during an examination."" Doctors remain able to address gun safety in general, though some say the threat of getting in trouble may hinder or prevent that discussion from taking place. The difference here is asking about gun ownership versus talking about gun safety",True,"June 6, 2011"
"""We have seized more currency, more drugs, more outbound arms in the past year than any year in our country’s history.""","As members of the Obama administration push for immigration reform, they’re casting themselves as border security hawks.

President Barack Obama said he has ""gone above and beyond"" what Republicans requested for border patrol.

U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, a former governor of Arizona, was even more emphatic during a May talk at the Atlanta Press Club. She said ""there has never been a larger, more sustained and better effort"" on the border than today.

""We have seized more currency, more drugs, more outbound arms in the past year than any year in our country’s history,""  Napolitano said.

Has the country’s haul of contraband really reached such historic highs?

We asked the Department of Homeland Security for proof. It gave us statistics for seizures by U.S. Customs and Border Protection and Immigration Customs Enforcement that compared two-and-a-half years under Obama and the last two-and-a-half years under President George W. Bush.

According to the data for the U.S.-Mexico border:

* Illegal currency seizures grew by about 75 percent from $124.5 million to $218.7 million.
* Illegal drug seizures grew 31 percent, from 3.2 million kilos to 4.2 million kilos.
* Illegal weapons seizures grew 64 percent from about 3,100 to 5,200.

We asked for more data, but despite more than two weeks of requests, DHS did not give us additional information. So we turned to other sources.

In October 2010, the Government Accountability Office, the nonpartisan investigative arm of the U.S. Congress, issued a report on the federal government’s effort to stop cross-border currency smuggling. Data show that cash seizures jumped after the March 2009 start of a program to boost seizures of outbound money and drugs.

During the first year of that program, Customs and Border Protection seized about $34 million heading out of the country on land, overwhelmingly from the southwest border. The agency seized $16.8 million in the year leading up to it.

The cash seizures, however, varied widely from about $1 million to $8 million per month and likely account for only a fraction of the money that crosses the borders. An estimated $18 billion to $39 billion is smuggled out of the southwest border each year, according to the GAO report.

Marijuana drug seizures increased almost 50 percent from 1.6 million pounds in fiscal year 2008 to 2.4 million pounds in fiscal year 2010, according to a separate March 2011 GAO report. We were unable to find similar firearms figures.  

Further complicating the issue is that as of fiscal year 2011, Customs and Border Protection no longer reports data on its success detecting contraband, according to the March 2011 report.

Experts on counternarcotics told us they have no reason to doubt Napolitano’s claim. In recent years, the DHS has doubled the number of border patrol agents, installed technology that makes it easier to detect contraband and paid more attention to coordinating their efforts with Mexico.

Improving the border effort, however, did not require an exceptional effort, experts told us.  Previously, there was little emphasis on seizing illegal guns, noted Vanda Felbab-Brown, a fellow in foreign policy at the Brookings Institution.

""Yes, we are capturing more arms than ever because we now try for the first time; the baselines are extremely low,"" Felbab-Brown wrote PolitiFact Georgia in an email.

It’s also important to note that these increases in seizures are not proof DHS’ efforts are successful, said Eric L. Olson, a counternarcotics expert at the Mexico Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. He said we need to know what percentage of contraband is being captured.  

If DHS drug seizures climbed 10 percent, but 100 percent more drugs are being smuggled across the border, that’s hardly a success.  

""They’re doing more things,"" Olson said of the DHS, ""but whether it is accomplishing anything is another question.""

That’s a question we may be unable to answer, he added. It’s extremely difficult to calculate the total amount of drugs entering the country.

To sum up:

The data DHS gave us is not enough to prove definitively that Napolitano’s claim that the agency has ""seized more currency, more drugs, more outbound arms in the past year than any year in our country’s history.""

We can say that seizures increased recently under the Obama administration, but they were so low in the past that the bump is not a major accomplishment. Also, the seized contraband is likely such a small percentage of what crosses the border that the increase’s impact on the illegal drug trade is slight.

By PolitiFact’s rules, the burden of proof is on the person who makes the claim",Half True,"June 3, 2011"
"Oregon concealed gun applications include ""home phone numbers, home address, Social Security numbers, what kinds of guns you have in the house … whether you were dishonorably discharged from the military, what controlled substances you are taking and  were you ever accused of -- accused, mind you -- of stalking.""","
The Oregon House recently passed a bill that would remove concealed handgun applications from the public record. Proponents of the bill say that there’s too much personal information on individual citizens tied up in the documents.

Public records should focus on the government, not private citizens, they say.

Here’s Rep. Kim Thatcher’s full-throated defense of the move from the House debate on the day they passed the bill:

""As the law stands now, the information in these applications includes things like, home phone numbers, home address, Social Security numbers, what kinds of guns you have in the house -- that's what's on the application -- whether you were dishonorably discharged from the military, what controlled substances you are taking and were you ever accused of -- accused, mind you -- of stalking,"" Thatcher, R-Keizer, said. ""And right now all of that would be subject to public records disclosure.""

That’s an awful lot of information, indeed. But being our usual suspicious selves, we wondered whether all of that was truly included in the application.

So, we did a quick check -- well, we thought it would be a quick check. We’d just pull down the Multnomah County Sheriff’s online license application and take a look, right? Well, it turns out that each of Oregon’s 36 counties has a slightly different application -- some considerably more stringent, some considerably less. After a few days of web searching and phone calling, we got our hands on 34 of the applications.

Here’s what we found:

-""Home phone numbers"": Yes. This is one of the first things every application we reviewed asks for.

-""Home address"": Yes, again. You also have to include a mailing address if that’s different.

-""Social Security numbers"": Sort of. Every application we reviewed asks for a Social Security number, but all, save two, expressly note that ""disclosure of your Social Security account number is voluntary.""

-""What kinds of guns you have in the house"": Not usually. On 24 of the applications we looked through, there was no question asking applicants about current ownership. Of the remaining eight, six asked whether you ""currently own or possess a firearm,"" but only if you have ever been dishonorably discharged from the armed forces, renounced your U.S. citizenship, been ordered to register as a sex offender in any state or use controlled substances. Everybody else can skip the question. The remaining four from Baker, Grant, Gilliam and Klamath counties ask all applicants for this information.

-""Whether you were dishonorably discharged from the military"": Yes, this is on most applications. If you have been, you also have to say when it happened.

-""What controlled substances you are taking"": Yep, this is there. Such controlled substances, for those who are curious, include but are not ""limited to, marijuana, cocaine, methamphetamine, methadone, LSD, or ecstasy."" (That quote is from the Multnomah County application.)

-""Were you ever accused of ... stalking"": Nope. Eleven applications don’t touch on this subject at all. The other 23 ask only if the applicant is ""currently subject to any type of restraining or stalking order by the court."" They also have to include some specifics about that situation if that question applies to them. That said, if the order has been lifted, the question doesn’t apply -- note the word ""currently.""

For what it’s worth, those last two questions (the one on controlled substances and the one about stalking) are pretty important given that federal law, according to the application, prohibits folks who say yes to those questions from possessing firearms at all, much less handguns of the concealed variety.

Thatcher is spot on when it comes to four of her assertions (the phone numbers, home addresses, military discharge and controlled substances), but she’s less accurate on the other three  (social security, current gun ownership and stalking).

When we called her office, Rep. Thatcher -- and later her spokeswoman Dawn Phillips -- told us she wasn’t making sweeping proclamations about all of the applications. What matters, they said, is that her comments apply to some of the state’s 36 applications. On that point, she’s pretty close to right. That is, except for the stalking claim. Thatcher makes it sound as though anybody accused of stalking at any point in their lives would have to say so on the application. But that’s just no true.

On certain applications, you have to noted whether you are currently under a court order. That’s considerably different, in our view",Mostly True,"March 26, 2011"
Says Texas colleges and universities may opt to allow guns on campuses.,"
State Rep. Eddie Rodriguez, D-Austin, recently said he supports the right to carry firearms, but individual schools colleges should decide whether students can pack them rather than legislators approving a blanket law permitting concealed handguns on campuses.

Appearing on CNN on Feb. 22, Rodriguez said: ""Colleges and universities can have guns on campus (now), allow it to happen, and they haven’t done it. He was interviewed alongside state Sen. Jeff Wentworth, R-San Antonio, who has authored legislation allowing concealed handguns on college campuses. Only Utah has such a law.

We wondered if colleges can already to permit guns on campus.

To back up Rodriguez, Nate Walker, his chief of staff, pointed us to Section 46.03 of the state penal code, which includes language in place since 1974 listing places where weapons, including firearms, cannot be taken. The law says it’s illegal to bring a firearm on ""the physical premises of a school or educational institution, any grounds or building on which an activity sponsored by a school or educational institution is being conducted, or a passenger transportation vehicle of a school or educational institution, whether the school or educational institution is public or private, unless pursuant to written regulations or written authorization of the institution.""

According to W. Scott Lewis, Texas legislative director of Students for Concealed Carry on Campus, ""a college or university could (now) choose to create an administrative policy overruling the statutory prohibition against possessing a firearm at an educational institution,"" he said, pointing to the same section of the penal code.

Brian Malte, state legislative director for the Washington-based Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, which advocates for gun regulations, also interpreted the law to mean universities and colleges can grant concealed-carry permit holders permission to bring handguns onto campus ""on a case by case basis.""

Lewis said no Texas college has permitted guns on campus, but in 2007 the Harrold school district, northwest of Fort Worth near Oklahoma, gave employees the OK to carry concealed firearms, a development we confirmed in an August 2008 Associated Press news article. The district’s policy was the first in Texas, the Houston Chronicle reported a month later.

The policy, which refers to the law highlighted by Rodriguez’s aide, states the board ""may, from time to time, authorize specific school employees to possess certain firearms on school property, at school-sponsored or school-sanctioned events, and at board meetings."" Only employees with an up-to-date concealed handgun license are eligible, the policy says.

David Thweatt, the district’s superintendent, told us the policy has not been challenged in court.

Wondering why no college has similarly allowed concealed weapons, we consulted state Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson, who as a state senator authored the 1995 legislation allowing Texans to carry concealed handguns.

Patterson pointed to Section 46.035 in the penal code, which he speculated trumps any permission a university may grant to a concealed handgun license holder. The section says it’s illegal for a concealed handgun license holder to carry a handgun on ""the premises where a high school, collegiate, or professional sporting event or interscholastic event is taking place, unless the license holder is a participant and a handgun is used in the event.""

""At what time does the University of Texas campus have a sporting event not going on?"" Patterson said. ""What is a sporting event? Is that a workout? .. I don’t think as a practical matter they could allow anyone to carry a handgun.""

Austin attorney Allen Halbrook, who has defended licensed firearms dealers, pointed out that ""premises"" is defined in the penal code as ""a building or a portion of building"" in the penal code. Halbrook said he thought it would generally be illegal to bring a concealed handgun into a classroom.

But, Halbrook speculated, maybe not other places on campus: ""For instance, if I’m a legal, 21-year-old student who’s qualified to own and possess a handgun, if the college permits it, I could have one in my dorm room,"" he said.

Finally, we turned to state authorities for clarification. Most were mum.

Spokespeople at Texas A&M University, the University of Texas System, the Higher Education Coordinating Board, the Department of Public Safety and the Texas Legislative Council, which Walker said informed Rodriguez about the law by telephone, each declined to comment.

Jerry Strickland, a spokesman for the Texas attorney general’s office, reiterated the prohibition against firearms in school buildings, at sporting events and on ""any grounds or building on which activity sponsored by a school or educational institution is being conducted."" Yet he also noted that firearms aren’t restricted by law from school streets, sidewalks and parking areas.

Strickland declined to comment on whether colleges and universities can allow concealed handgun holders to bring their guns into other areas of campus. ""We have not had occasion to look at that issue thoroughly,"" he said.

Our take: State law allows higher-ed institutions to permit weapons, though concealed handguns are prohibited from sporting and interscholastic events",Mostly True,"March 17, 2011"
"""We have over 25 million people who live in Texas and less than 2 percent of them have"" concealed handgun licenses.","Defending his legislation to allow concealed handguns on college campuses, state Sen. Jeff Wentworth, R-San Antonio, said not many Texans have the state license that’s required to even carry a concealed gun. ""We have over 25 million people who live in Texas and less than 2 percent of them have these licenses,"" he said on CNN on Feb. 22.  According to the 2010 census, about 25.1 million people live in Texas. Next, we turned to the Texas Department of Public Safety. Spokesman Tom Vinger told us that ""a little over 460,000"" people in Texas have concealed handgun licenses. A 1995 Texas law allows adults 21 and older who meet certain requirements, including passing a background check, to get such licenses. Vinger pointed us to the department’s annual reports on active concealed handgun license and instructor counts. As of Dec. 31, Texas has 461,724 active license holders, according to the department’s most recent report, posted online Feb. 14. We also wondered whether other states had a similarly low percentage of concealed handgun-license holders. According to a fact-sheet posted on the National Rifle Association Institute for Legislative Action’s website in April, 40 states have laws allowing individuals to carry handguns, with Florida issuing more carry permits than any other state — 1.7 million. That’s about 9 percent of Florida’s 18.5 million-large population, according to a 2009 estimate by the Census Bureau. So, 1.8 percent of the Texas population is licensed to carry a concealed handgun",True,"March 17, 2011"
"The American Academy of Pediatrics ""supports banning guns.""","
One of the more intriguing subplots so far during the 2011 Florida legislative session has been a fight between two powerful Tallahassee special interests -- the gun lobby and doctors.

The bills at issue are SB 432 and its companion HB 155. The measures, being pushed by gun interests, would prohibit doctors from asking their patients, or their patients' families, if they keep a gun at home. An original version of the bill made it a felony punishable with up to a $5 million fine for asking whether a patient owned a firearm. An amended version lowered the penalty to a non-criminal violation with a $500 fine (which could grow if the doctor willfully broke the law or was a repeat offender).

The American Academy of Pediatrics currently encourages physicians to counsel parents on creating a safe home environment and offers advice to avoid preventable accidents. The long list of recommendations includes mainly innocuous tips like ""Keep plastic bags and balloons away from your children,"" and ""NEVER place an infant in front of an air bag."" But physicians also are told to tell parents to remove guns from places where children live and play.

Previously, we've looked into a claim by state Rep. Jason Brodeur, R-Sanford, that part of the reasoning behind the bill he sponsored is to keep gun ownership information from being recorded and collected by the federal government and insurance companies as part of the federal health care law. We rated that claim False, noting that the federal health care law specifically prohibits doctors and insurance companies from collecting gun information.

Marion Hammer, a longtime lobbyist for the Unified Sportsmen of Florida and a former president of the National Rifle Association, offered another reason to support the gun legislation. Doctors are playing politics in the exam room by asking a question they don't need to know the answer to.

""Doctors are pushing gun-ban politics on their patients,"" Hammer told a Senate committee on Feb. 22, 2011. Hammer made similar comments to a House committee on March 8, as well as in this e-mail to gun-rights supporters. ""They have been pushing a gun-ban agenda and have been bringing their gun-ban politics into examining rooms.

""The American Academy of Pediatrics supports banning guns,"" she said. ""It's blatant, and it's there on their website. All you have to do is log on and see it.""

So log on to the academy's website we did, at www.aap.org.

Sure enough, we quickly found a long list of policy statements, including a policy paper called ""Firearm-Related Injuries Affecting the Pediatric Population."" The academy says its policy on firearm-related injuries was first set in 1992 and reaffirmed in 2004.

The policy paper says that in 1997, 32,436 firearm-related deaths occurred in the United States, and 4,223 of the victims were children and teenagers under 20. The paper also says that in 1997, 306 children and teens under 20 were killed by firearms as a result of unintentional firearm-related injuries.

The academy then makes several recommendations to reduce firearm-related injuries.

The first recommendation is that ""the most effective measure to prevent firearm-related injuries to children and adolescents is the absence of guns from homes and communities,"" the academy writes. ""Firearm regulation, to include bans of handguns and assault weapons, is the most effective way to reduce firearm-related injuries.""

Other recommendations include urging pediatricians to inform parents about the danger of guns, advocating for trigger locks and other safety mechanisms, and supporting the development of nonviolent, gun-free television programs and video games.

The policy paper clearly supports banning handguns and assault weapons, but it does not explicitly advocate a complete ban on guns, which likely would require an amendment to the U.S. Constitution. It addresses legal concerns by saying the federal government could ban ""whole categories of firearms.""

The academy notably also supported Chicago's handgun ban in a case that came before the U.S. Supreme Court. ""The best way to truly protect children from firearm injuries is to get guns out of their homes, their neighborhoods and where they play,"" said AAP President Judith S. Palfrey. ""If we don't, too many children will continue to be hurt or die needlessly.""

And Hammer pointed us toward another position statement that she said had been on a second AAP website, www.healthychildren.org. ""The most effective way to prevent firearm-related injury to children is to keep guns out of homes and communities. The American Academy of Pediatrics strongly supports gun-control legislation. We believe that handguns, deadly air guns and assault weapons should be banned.""

That statement appears to have been replaced on the website. The statement on ""where we stand"" now reads: ""The safest home for a child is a home without a gun. However, if a gun is present in the home of a child, the gun should be stored unloaded and locked, with the ammunition locked separately, so that a child cannot access the gun.""

Interestingly, some gun-control groups have realized the use of the word ""ban"" is a red flag and have tried to avoid it. The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, for instance, says it is not a ""gun-ban"" organization and that ""a safer America can be achieved without banning guns."" Brady does say certain types of guns, such as military-style assault weapons like Uzis and AK-47s, should be ""out of bounds for private ownership.""

Debbie Linchesky, a spokeswoman for the American Academy of Pediatrics, referred comment on the issue to Louis St. Petery, a Leon County pediatrician and member of the academy's Florida chapter.

St. Petery said Hammer is distorting the position of doctors.

""It's certainly a mischaracterization of where we are on things,"" St. Petery said. ""Forty percent of folks in this country own guns. We (my family) own a gun.

""It's not that we feel that guns need to be eliminated from the face of the Earth, which is what Ms. Hammer would suggest,"" he said.

St. Petery said doctors aren't pushing a political agenda; rather, they're trying to keep children safe. If doctors know someone owns a pool, they want to use their limited time with a patient discussing pool safety. If doctors know someone owns a gun, they want to discuss gun safety, he said.

""We are trying to do the best job we can to protect children,"" St. Petery said. ""We feel that's our job, prevention is what it's about.""

That brings us back to Hammer's claim. In making her case to support a bill that would make it illegal for doctors to ask patients about guns, Hammer says doctors -- particularly pediatricians -- are bringing politics into the exam rooms. We cannot make a judgment on that, but we can assess her claim that the American Academy of Pediatrics ""supports banning guns.""

We found no evidence that the academy supports an outright ban on all guns. But the academy does say that ""firearm regulation, to include bans of handguns and assault weapons, is the most effective way to reduce firearm-related injuries."" It also voiced support for Chicago's handgun-ban law. We think Hammer could have been slightly more clear in making her case to the Legislature",Mostly True,"March 14, 2011"
"""We don’t have bars on campus in Texas. It’s against the law... no alcohol allowed.""","
State Sen. Jeff Wentworth, R-San Antonio, played hardball with MSNBC’s Chris Matthews last week, when the pair scuffled over whether suds are allowed on college campuses.

Wentworth, discussing his legislation that would allow concealed handguns on college campuses, balked when Matthews wondered whether ""booze and guns"" are a healthy combination.

""We don’t have bars on campus in Texas,"" Wentworth said on the Feb. 22 segment.

Matthews: ""You don’t?""

Wentworth: ""It’s against the law in Texas. That’s exactly right.""

Matthews: ""It is?""

Wentworth: ""Yes, sir. No alcohol allowed.""

Wentworth went on to clarify that he was limiting his characterization to public colleges and universities. When Matthews said he knew a lot of colleges that have campus bars, Wentworth said: ""They don’t in Texas. We’re talking about Texas.""

We decided to check whether bars and alcohol are allowed on college campuses in Texas.

When we asked Wentworth for backup, he pointed us to a section in the state’s Alcoholic Beverage Code about alcohol sales near schools. According to the code, a county commissioners court or the governing body of an incorporated city or town can prohibit the sale of alcoholic beverages within 300 of a private or public school or within 1,000 feet of a public school at the school district’s request.

Carolyn Beck, a spokeswoman for the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission, told us that the code doesn’t specifically define ""public school"" so ""there are some cities that interpret schools to include colleges and universities.""

The Alcoholic Beverage Code also cites a section of the Education Code, which requires a school district’s board of trustees to prohibit alcoholic beverages at ""school-related or school-sanctioned activity on or off private property.""

Yet Andy Kesling, a spokesman for the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, told us that the words ""school district"" in the Education Code indicate that the provision is limited to public schools through high school. Debbie Ratcliffe, a spokeswoman for the Texas Education Agency, later agreed that the law does not apply to higher education.

Next, we contacted some Texas universities to gauge whether they have campus bars.

Rhonda Weldon, a spokeswoman for the University of Texas at Austin, told us the university’s Texas Union building houses both the Cactus Cafe, which has a liquor license, and the Underground, which is licensed to serve beer and wine. She said other campus venues where alcohol can be served, such as the Frank Erwin Center and the AT&T Executive and Education Conference Center, are run by contractors who are licensed to sell alcohol.

Wentworth called UT-Austin an exception. He said too that alcohol was prohibited on campus when he attended the Texas Tech University School of Law. Wentworth earned his law degree there in 1971.

Texas Tech spokesman Chris Cook confirmed that students aren’t allowed to have alcohol on campus and no campus establishments serve alcohol. But, Cook said, alcohol is sold in suites and club areas where university donors often sit in the football stadium and basketball arena, and is available during special events, such as receptions.

Next we tried Wentworth’s undergraduate alma mater, Texas A&M University. Spokesman Jason Cook said: ""We don’t have bars on campus, in the common term, but alcohol is allowed on campus and is served on campus under special circumstances."" The University Club, a campus dining facility, hosts a happy hour; the 21-and-older crowd can enjoy a $2 scotch or $3 sangria, among drink specials, from 4-7 p.m. Wednesday through Friday, according to A&M’s web page about the club.

Cook said too that the Zone Club, an exclusive seating area in the football stadium, serves alcohol. According to A&M’s athletic department’s website, the Club includes a full-service bar.

In San Marcos,Texas State University spokesman Jayme Blaschke told us that George’s, in the student center, serves beer. When we asked whether George’s is a bar, he said it’s ""an establishment that serves alcohol"" that isn’t a full-service restaurant.

Next, we looked north, learning that The Pub on the University of Texas at Dallas campus serves wine and beer during certain hours Monday through Friday — with a limit of two drinks per person, according to the university’s website.

John Walls, a UT-Dallas spokesman, said the university doesn’t consider The Pub to be a bar because it has a full food menu.

Lastly, we looked for a legal definition of a bar. Beck told us that as far as she knows, none exists in state law.

For what it’s worth, the online Merriam-Webster dictionary slaps the ""bar"" label on ""a counter at which food or especially alcoholic beverages are served.""

Time to close our tab. We found two Texas universities that have bars on campus while other schools we contacted routinely serve alcohol in campus facilities.

Wentworth’s claim appears to have no legal or on-the-town grounding",False Pants on Fire,"February 26, 2011"
"""Across the board, violent crime in jurisdictions that recognize the Right to Carry is lower than in areas that prevent it.""","
Wayne LaPierre of the National Rifle Association delivered a stirring defense of gun ownership at the Conservative Political Action Conference in the wake of the mass shooting in Arizona.

""It's time to acknowledge what we know in our hearts to be true -- that the best way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun,"" he said. ""Just knowing there's a good guy with a gun around -- a cop, a guard, a soldier … and, yes, a law-abiding citizen with a gun -- makes us feel safer … because we are safer.""

LaPierre said it was time for a national ""right to carry"" law, a measure that many states already have adopted. Generally speaking, it means that law-abiding citizens have the ""right to carry"" guns as they go about their daily business. (There are typically a few exceptions, such as in government buildings and schools.)

""Right now, in the United States, 7 million law-abiding Americans legally carry a concealed firearm, 7 million in almost every state in the country,"" he said. ""And across the board, violent crime in jurisdictions that recognize the Right to Carry is lower than in areas that prevent it. The whole flock is safer when the wolves can't tell the difference between the lions and the lambs.""

It's a matter of opinion whether a national ""right to carry"" law is a good idea, but we were interested in his statement that ""violent crime in jurisdictions that recognize the Right to Carry is lower than in areas that prevent it."" So we decided to check it out.

We contacted the NRA and asked them about the statement, but we didn't hear back. We decided to begin with information from the NRA website, which claims that 40 states have ""right to carry"" laws, while 10 restrict it.

We should note that opinions may differ on whether a state has a ""right to carry"" law or not. The NRA says a state has a ""right to carry"" law if permits to carry are issued to applicants who meet uniform standards established by the state legislature. If state officials have the discretion to refuse individual applicants, then in the NRA's view, they're not ""right to carry"" states. The NRA identifies 10 states as lacking ""right to carry"" laws: California, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin.

We next turned to the FBI's crime statistics, looking particularly at the violent crime rate. This is a statistic that counts violent crimes per 100,000 inhabitants. We should note that the FBI warns people not to create ratings from these statistics, saying that rankings ""provide no insight into the numerous variables that mold crime in a particular town, city, county, state, or region."" We went ahead and created a state ranking anyway, knowing that it wouldn't necessarily establish a causal link between ""right to carry"" laws and a lower crime rate. At this point, we simply wanted to see if the statistics were consistent with what LaPierre said.

We found the the states without ""right to carry"" were spread out across the list, not bunched together at the top. The District of Columbia, which has strict gun control laws, ranked highest for violent crime. The other states ranked as follows: Delaware, No. 5; Maryland, No. 10; Illinois, No. 13; California, No. 17; Massachusetts, No. 18; New York, No. 24; New Jersey, No. 30; Hawaii, No. 36; Wisconsin, No. 39, and Rhode Island, No. 42.

We also couldn't help noticing that some states with laws that favor gun ownership placed at different points along the list. The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence rates state gun laws, so we looked at the 14 states that had the weakest gun laws. Here, we also saw a wide variation in where the states ranked in terms of violent crime: Alaska, No. 6; Louisiana, No. 7; New Mexico, No. 8; Arkansas, No. 11; Oklahoma, No. 12; Missouri, No. 15; Arizona, No. 21; West Virginia, No. 32; Kentucky, No. 38; Montana, No. 41; Idaho, No. 44; Utah, No. 47; North Dakota, No. 48, and South Dakota, No. 49.

So using the 2009 data, we don't see any evidence that state gun laws correlate with violent crime rates one way or the other, at least not ""across the board"" as LaPierre suggested in his speech.

Still, there's a more in-depth way to study violent crime rates, using many sets of data over multiple years and controlling for external factors. The book More Guns, Less Crime, by John R. Lott, first published in 1998, makes a case that by using extensive data sets, one can see clear reductions in crime over many years in states and counties that have ""right to carry"" laws, and he has continued to make that case in new editions of the book. But Lott's work has also been critiqued as flawed by other academics, who say that relatively small adjustments to the data sets yield different results or that Lott doesn't account for other factors that could be affecting crime rates.

The National Academies of Sciences concluded in 2005 that current data do not allow for firm conclusions about how ""right to carry"" laws affect crime. We think it's worth quoting the conclusion from Firearms and Violence: A Critical Review:

""The literature on right-to-carry laws summarized in this chapter has obtained conflicting estimates of their effects on crime ... No link between right-to-carry laws and changes in crime is apparent in the raw data, even in the initial sample; it is only once numerous covariates are included that the negative results in the early data emerge. While the trend models show a reduction in the crime growth rate following the adoption of right-to-carry laws, these trend reductions occur long after law adoption, casting serious doubt on the proposition that the trend models estimated in the literature reflect effects of the law change. Finally, some of the point estimates are imprecise. Thus, the committee concludes that with the current evidence it is not possible to determine that there is a causal link between the passage of right-to-carry laws and crime rates.""

Getting back to our rating. LaPierre said, ""Across the board, violent crime in jurisdictions that recognize the Right to Carry is lower than in areas that prevent it."" LaPierre could have used a qualifier here about studies that control for various effects, but he didn't: He said flat out that violent crime is lower in areas with ""right to carry."" We do not find that current crime statistics support this point. Some academics have said trends over time show that ""right to carry"" laws lower crime rates, but that argument is contested. There's certainly not straight-line correlation between states with ""right to carry"" laws and crime rates. LaPierre made it sound like the data clearly supported his view. They don't",False,"February 16, 2011"
"Since Sept. 11, 2001, ""270,000 Americans were killed by gunfire at home.""","
In the Sunday, Feb. 13, 2011, installment of the comic strip Doonesbury, Mark Slackmeyer -- a longtime character in the strip who is a liberal radio host -- makes a point about gun violence.

""What are we like as a people?"" Slackmeyer muses to himself in his studio. ""Nine years, ago we were attacked -- 3,000 people died. In response, we started two long, bloody wars and built a vast homeland-security apparatus -- all at a cost of trillions! Now consider this. During those same nine years, 270,000 Americans were killed by gunfire at home. Our response? We weakened our gun laws.""

At that point, a whirring sound comes from off-panel. In the final panel, we see that his guest is a space alien, who says, ""Fail. Cannot Comprehend."" To which Slackmeyer cracks, ""Well, you may be a little jet-lagged.""

A reader asked us to fact-check it. So we’ll look at whether since Sept. 11, 2001, ""270,000 Americans were killed by gunfire at home.""

We began by contacting Garry Trudeau, the cartoonist who has drawn Doonesbury for more than four decades. He got back immediately with a summary of his methodology.

""The final figure lacks precision, because it's extrapolated,"" Trudeau wrote us, noting, correctly, that the most recent data for gun deaths from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is from 2007. 
""What I had were six years -- 2002-2007 -- of a remarkably stable number, around 30,000"" gun deaths per year, Trudeau wrote. ""So in my judgment, multiplying 30,000 times nine yielded a figure reasonable and accurate enough for rhetorical purposes without using hyperbole. If anything, it may be slightly on the low side."" 
We found that Trudeau was basically right. We went to the same CDC database he used -- the Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System (or WISQARS for short) -- and got virtually identical numbers. Our number came out slightly higher -- 281,757 -- because we not only extrapolated out through the end of 2010 in our calculations but also included the final three months of 2001.

We should note the details of Trudeau’s definition of gun deaths, which is also the definition we would have used if we’d been starting from scratch. It includes the following categories:

• Suicides: 102,002 between 2002 and 2007
• Homicides: 73,148 between 2002 and 2007
• Accidental: 4,185 between 2002 and 2007
• Legal shootings: 1,999 between 2002 and 2007
• Undetermined: 1,427 between 2002 and 2007

-- Total: 182,761 between 2002 and 2007

So on the numbers, Trudeau’s methodology was accurate.

The only thing that threw us was how the strip had described where the deaths occurred -- ""270,000 Americans were killed by gunfire at home"" (our emphasis).

Initially, we took that to mean that 270,000 Americans were literally killed in or near their homes. And we knew that couldn’t be right, because the number both we and Trudeau calculated included all gunfire deaths, wherever they had occurred.

When we asked criminologists for guidance on what percentage of gun deaths occur at home, they said the statistics on that question are scattershot. James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University, provided data on Chicago homicides from an amicus brief he wrote for a Supreme Court case. Since 1965, the ratio of outside-the-home handgun homicides in Chicago to those occurring at home has tended to bounce around from about two-to-one in the 1970s to about five-to-one in the 1990s.

So if one interprets ""at home"" to mean in or near someone’s home, the numbers Trudeau calculated wouldn’t be correct.

When we raised this point with Trudeau, he said that wasn’t what he meant: ""I didn't say ‘in the home,’ I said ‘at home’ as opposed to abroad, where the wars are. Failure to communicate clearly, I guess. Rats.""

Reading through it again, we think Trudeau’s explanation sounds reasonable. But we decided to mark Trudeau down slightly because we think it’s also reasonable for people to make the same initial assumption we did, that ""at home"" means in or near one’s home",Mostly True,"February 14, 2011"
Says gun ownership information could be recorded and collected by the federal government and insurance companies as part of the federal health care law.,"
A freshman Florida lawmaker is grabbing national headlines for sponsoring a bill that would make it a felony for doctors to ask their patients if they own guns.

State Rep. Jason Brodeur, R-Sanford, has filed HB 155, the Privacy of Firearms Owners Act, which seeks to punish doctors with fines up to a $5 million for asking a patient or a patient's family about gun ownership and gun habits. The proposal is a reaction to American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines, which encourage physicians to counsel parents on creating a safe home environment and offering advice to avoid preventable accidents. The long list of recommendations includes mainly innocuous tips like ""Keep plastic bags and balloons away from your children,"" and ""NEVER place an infant in front of an air bag.""

Physicians also are encouraged to tell parents to remove guns from places where children live and play.

""More than 5,000 children and adolescents are killed by gunfire each year -- injuries almost always inflicted by themselves, a sibling or a friend,"" the doctor's group says as part of suggested counseling for parents. ""Handguns are especially dangerous. If you choose to keep a gun at home, store it unloaded in a locked place. Lock and store the ammunition in a separate place.""

Brodeur says the advice is out of bounds and that it infringes on people's privacy protections. The controversial measure has proven fodder for CNN's Anderson Cooper.

But what has so far been left out of the debate is Brodeur's suggestion that his bill could have even more privacy implications because of the passage of the federal health care overhaul in 2010. The law is now facing an aggressive court challenge.

Speaking to the Fort Myers News-Press, Brodeur said he's concerned about doctors asking patients about guns in the home and then allowing that information to get into the hands of the government or insurance companies.

""What we don't want to do is have law-abiding firearm owners worried that the information is going to be recorded and then sent to their insurance company,"" Brodeur said. ""If the overreaching federal government actually takes over health care, they're worried that Washington, D.C., is going to know whether or not they own a gun and so this is really just a privacy protection.""

The federal health care law is 974 pages long -- long enough for important details to get sometimes overlooked (we like this one) and long enough for outrageous claims (like here, and here, and our favorite, here.)

We wondered where Brodeur's claim fit in.

The health care law and guns

So much can be revealed by simply reading the health care law, formally called the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Or if that's too much -- just try searching for keywords. We accessed the final version of the law through the White House's web site.

Then we searched for the word ""gun.""

Here's what we found: ""(c) PROTECTION OF SECOND AMENDMENT GUN RIGHTS."" So we read on.

The gun provision of the law has two main thrusts -- that no one in the government can use the health care law to collect gun information and that insurance companies cannot adjust their rates because someone owns a gun.

""A premium rate may not be increased, health insurance coverage may not be denied, and a discount, rebate, or reward offered for participation in a wellness program may not be reduced or withheld under any health benefit plan issued pursuant to or in accordance with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or an amendment made by that Act on the basis of, or on reliance upon -- (A) the lawful ownership or possession of a firearm or ammunition; or (B) the lawful use or storage of a firearm or ammunition,"" the law reads in part.

That gun language was added by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid specifically to placate gun owners, who argued that the health care law could be used as a way for the federal government to create a national gun registry or charge gun owners more for insurance. So to avoid any (more) backlash about the law, Reid included a provision to further protect gun owners from either seeing their insurance rates increase, or from having their names collected and entered into some federal gun owner database.

""In the face of all this abuse, Senator Reid was pressured by Gun Owners of America and his constituents into making a face-saving move,"" the lobbying group Gun Owners of America wrote on its blog. ""He wanted to silence the pro-gun community’s objections, so he took steps to strip the bill of any gun rights concerns.""

More on a gun registry

The health care law cannot be used to collect gun data, and it cannot be used to raise the insurance premiums of gun owners. But we wanted to step back and ask an even more basic question. Does the federal government keep a database of gun owners as Brodeur is asserting?

""There is no national firearms registry,"" said Jim Wright, a gun policy expert who teaches at the University of Central Florida.

William J. Vizzard, a criminal justice professor at California State University Sacramento who spent 27 years working for the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco & Firearms, agreed. The government does track some high-powered weapons like machine guns, grenades and short-barreled shotguns but not common firearms like handguns and rifles. There is no searchable database, and records are kept with gun dealers, Vizzard said.

Some states do register firearms, said Daniel Vice, a senior attorney at the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence. But not Florida.

""To say this is a response to Obamacare would be less accurate than to say this is in response to a more general problem going on long before Obamacare,"" added David Kopel, research director of the conservative-leaning Independence Institute and an adjunct professor of law at the University of Denver.

Kopel said he believes the real issue is with the proliferation of electronic medical records, which means that if a doctor asks a patient about guns, a permanent electronic record will be created and maintained. And though that record cannot be expressly used by insurance companies or the government, the record exists.

His point might be worth discussing. But in this case, it's not what we're checking.

Our ruling

We left a message with Brodeur's legislative office, but did not hear back.

Brodeur told the News-Press that his bill -- which would prevent doctors from asking patients if they own a gun -- was crafted to combat privacy concerns resulting from the passage of the federal health care law.

It turns out Brodeur's trying to right a ""wrong"" that isn't wrong.

The Republican Party raffled off an AR-15 assault rifle at the 2010 Oregon State Fair.,"
Turner resident Suzanne Devlin recently sent a letter to the Statesman Journal, taking Sarah Palin and other Republicans to task for using gun-heavy language and then trying to distance themselves from the shooting of Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords and several others in Tucson, Ariz. , in early January.

""I volunteer at the Democratic booth at the state fair. Last summer, as is my custom, I walked over to the Republican booth. The differences between the two parties couldn't be better illustrated than what I encountered,"" she wrote. ""While we were passing out free ice water, the Republicans were raffling off an AR-15 assault rifle.""

A reader suggested PolitiFact Oregon take this on, and we found the topic interesting enough to tackle. Is a semiautomatic AR-15 an assault rifle? And were members of the Republican Party raffling one off at the Oregon State Fair?

We called Greg Leo, our go-to man at GOP state party headquarters, and asked about the rifle raffle. The state party spokesman said, ""It is true."" How we love easy confirmations.

Leo went on to explain that the raffle was a fundraiser to benefit the Marion County Republican Central Committee. The state fair was just one of the locations where people could buy a $5 raffle ticket, and the rifle (.223 caliber) was not on site. The winner was directed to a dealer, who processed the paperwork and handled the transaction. Gun raffles, apparently, are not uncommon. The Oregon Firearms Federation is in the midst of raffling off five AR-15 rifles.

Now, is it accurate to call an AR-15 an ""assault rifle""?

Technically speaking, Kevin Starrett of the Oregon Firearms Federation says, it’s not an assault rifle because an assault rifle must be able to switch between semiautomatic -- one bullet with each trigger pull -- and fully automatic machine-gun style modes. The AR-15, in this case, is a semiautomatic only. Genuine assault rifles are hard to get in the United States, outside the military.

Still, look up the term ""AR-15 assault rifle"" online and you’ll find that even firearms sites describe the AR-15 as an assault rifle. When an unnamed man showed up with an AR-15 semiautomatic rifle at an Obama event in Phoenix nearly two years ago, news media used both ""assault weapon"" and ""assault rifle"" to describe the firearm. (CNN here; MSNBC picking up AP here.) The Associated Press Stylebook says the correct term is assault weapon, not assault rifle.

In any case, fans say the AR-15 is terrific for hunting and target shooting; it’s versatile and precise. (Fashionable, too. Look online to find a Pepto pink Hello Kitty version.) There’s a quibble with the definition of ""assault rifle,"" but it’s a small one",Mostly True,"January 29, 2011"
"More people die from ""medical misadventures"" than firearm accidents nationally and in Florida.","
Are you more likely to die as a result of an accident involving medical care or an accident involving a gun?

The National Rifle Association claims that in Florida and nationally, you are far more likely to die at the hands of a medical professional or procedure -- by accident -- than you are as a result of an accidental firearm incident.

We found a reference to that claim in a Jan. 16, 2011, Miami Herald article about Florida lawmakers filing bills related to firearms. The bills are attracting much interest after the Jan. 8 shooting in Arizona that killed six and injured Democratic Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords. One of the bills, Senate Bill 432 sponsored by state Sen. Greg Evers, R-Crestview, aims to prevent doctors from asking patients questions about their access to firearms and makes violations a felony punishable by up to a $5 million fine.

Doctors argue against the proposed law. It also would prohibit physicians from refusing to see patients who won't answer questions about guns and bans the medical staff from writing down information about patients and their guns. This bill, then, is a battle between the gun lobby and the doctors' lobby, two powerful groups in Tallahassee.

This Truth-O-Meter isn't going to weigh in on the argument about gun control. Our question: Are the fatality comparisons between medical mishaps and firearms correct?

NRA's accident facts

The Miami Herald article said NRA lobbyist Marion Hammer cited ""statistics showing that medical mishaps kill more people than guns,"" but did not cite the actual statistics. Hammer said she gave the Herald a one-page document called ""Firearms Accidents Facts"" compiled by the Unified Sportsmen of Florida in June 2010. The document compares accidental death by firearms to other types of accidents -- from choking to tricycles -- both nationally and in Florida. The Unified Sportsmen of Florida is the state's affiliate of the NRA.

The fact-sheet includes comparisons to accidental deaths by ""medical misadventures"" -- both in raw numbers and in rates per capita -- but doesn't specify the year. Medical misadventures, the handout says, ""is a term used by some statisticians to cover 'accidents' by doctors and other medical personnel."" Note that this claim covers only gun accidents -- it doesn't include firearm deaths due to murder or suicide.

According to the sheet:

• Nationally, ""4 times more die from 'medical misadventures' "" than firearms.
• In Florida, ""6 times more die from 'medical misadventures' "" than firearms.

Hammer on Jan. 17 directed us to Mark Overstreet, NRA Institute for Legislative Action research coordinator. He told us that the figures -- compiled by the NRA for Hammer -- were from 2007. He pointed us to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention WISQARS (Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System) -- an interactive database that provides customized reports.

The death data is compiled by the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics. This information comes from death certificates filed in state vital-statistics offices and includes causes of death reported by attending physicians, medical examiners and coroners, according to the CDC. All of the states comply with providing this data.

Firearm accident data 
On the WISQARS website, we searched Fatal Injury Reports 1999-2007 for ""unintentional,"" ""firearms,"" ""2007"" and ""United States."" That produced a chart that showed 613 deaths in the U.S. for 2007.

Then we queried the same data for Florida and found 16 deaths.

CDC's adverse effects data

The death data about medical care was far more complex. We'll walk you through the numbers and explain why it doesn't provide a complete picture. We'll also discuss the ""medical misadventures"" label.

On WISQARS, we marked ""all intents"" and ""medical care, adverse effects"" for 2007 and saw 2,248 deaths nationwide. For Florida, the number was 108 deaths.

We thought those figures sounded awfully low for deaths as a result of medical errors. A 1999 study by the Institute of Medicine, ""To Err is Human: Building a Safer Health System,"" concluded that medical error deaths range from about 44,000 to 98,000 a year.

Let's summarize what we found before we delve into why the government's data is so low on such deaths:

Accidental deaths 2007         Nationwide     Florida
Firearms                                          613                16
Medical care adverse effects        2,248               108

What the stats mean 
We interviewed Robert N. Anderson, chief of mortality statistics at the CDC, to explain what the numbers mean.

The deaths are coded by categories, and one category is indeed labeled ""misadventures to patients during surgical and medical care."" Some examples are an unintentional cut, a foreign object accidentally left in the body during surgery, and contaminated medical substances.

Other categories included in ""adverse effects:""

• Breakdown or malfunctioning of a medical device.

• ""Surgical and other medical procedures as the cause of abnormal reaction of the patient, or of later complication, without mention of misadventure at the time of the procedure."" Anderson told us that refers to procedures such as a patient reacting badly to an organ transplant.

• Complication of medical care, which was a significant factor even though the care (such as surgery) occurred more than one year prior to death. This is also often referred to as ""late effects,"" Anderson said.

So overall, ""medical care, adverse effects"" includes both errors and complications.

How many errors? 
We asked Anderson: Are the majority medical errors?

""I’m not sure,"" he wrote in an e-mail. ""Only a very few in adverse effects category are explicitly medical misadventures."" He added, ""Just because a misadventure is not specified, doesn’t mean that it didn’t occur. My guess is that many ... (in some categories) are indeed medical errors, but have been characterized as complications.""

Anderson also explained a key limitation of the data: It is only as accurate as the information provided on the death certificates by doctors. The WISQARS system tabulates types of deaths based on the ""underlying cause of death."" Suppose a man had heart disease and needed a heart procedure, a doctor punctured his artery during surgery and the patient bled to death. If the doctor reports the underlying cause of death as heart disease, then it won't be counted in the ""medical care, adverse effects"" category.

The CDC offers another source of online data called the WONDER system, which tabulates if a cause of death was mentioned anywhere on the death certificate, even if it wasn't listed as the ""underlying cause."" The most recent year we could look up for WONDER was 2006.

The WONDER database showed 22,116 deaths from ""medical care, adverse effects"" nationwide in 2006 and about 1,319 for Florida. Anderson acknowledges that even that figure is low.

The reason, according to Anderson: ""The physician who makes the error doesn't have any incentive to report it. Actually they have a disincentive to report it even though it's in the interests of medical care in general to have that information reported. ... We are at the mercy of the cause of death certifier and how thorough they are in their reporting of cause of death.""

Anderson said he personally finds some studies more believable than others -- for example he disagrees with counting all hospital infections as errors. But he says he agrees with the Institute of Medicine study that put the figure between 44,000 and 98,000 -- and says even though that study is from 1999, he believes little has changed since then.

Firearm data is  also uncertain

Anderson also raised a concern with the firearm data, that self-inflicted gun deaths could be accidental or a suicide, and some could be mis-classified or labeled as ""intent undetermined.""

It's worth repeating that the vast majority of firearm deaths are by suicide and murder -- only a small slice of firearm deaths are accidental. According to the WISQARS data, in 2007 there were 31,224 firearm deaths nationwide -- the largest category was suicide followed by murder. That total number of firearm deaths is many multiples higher than the CDC's count for ""medical care, adverse effects"" deaths.

We asked Hammer, why make the comparison solely on accidents?

""When doctors claim that they have a right to question children and the parents of children because they want to prevent deaths by accidents with firearms, the facts speak for themselves,"" Hammer said. ""There are a number of areas dealing with medical care over which they have some control that (doctors) should focus attention on.""

And Overstreet, the NRA researcher, defends the use of WISQARS data, even knowing its limitations.

""We are not looking to jack the numbers up,"" he said. ""We are saying this is what the federal government is reporting.""

Anderson doesn't disagree.

""With the data issues surrounding medical errors, it's a fairly difficult comparison,"" he said. However, ""I don't think they are off base. I don't think they are doing something making an invalid comparison. ... What they are basically doing is looking at the government's underlying cause data. They are not even saying it's a gross underestimate. They are being very conservative here.""

Our ruling 
So, is the NRA right to state that, nationwide, people are four times more likely to die from medical misadventures than firearm accidents and that figure drops to six times more likely for Florida? 
The government's 2007 data shows 613 accidental firearm deaths nationwide compared to 2,248 deaths from medical care adverse effect. That's close to four times, as the NRA handout says. In Florida, there were 16 accidental firearm deaths compared to 108 medical care adverse effect. That's almost seven times, even worse than the six times cited by the NRA.

We have two concerns: The WISQARS data comes with a lot of caveats when examining medical errors, and even the gun data may not be perfect. And the NRA's fact-sheet ignores gun deaths from murders and suicides, which take a significantly higher toll than accidents and can't be ignored in the gun debate. 
For the point the NRA is making -- accidents only, guns v. medical misadventures -- the numbers back up their claims but need clarification and context",Mostly True,"January 24, 2011"
"Under federal law, Jared Loughner ""would not have been able to buy a gun"" had he been identified as mentally ill.","
Jared Loughner, the 22-year-old Tucson man accused of killing six people and injuring 13 others including Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, scared community college classmates even before his alleged rampage. He should have been diagnosed, treated and kept in a mental health institution as long as he was a danger to others, or so goes the national conversation.

But that never happened. 
And the shameful irony is that under a bill that President George W. Bush signed, ""if he had been identified with this mental illness, he would not have been able to buy this gun,"" U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown said in a discussion of the mental health safety net during an appearance on MSNBC’s ""Morning Joe"" program. ""I mean, the laws were there, but he fell through the system, he fell through the cracks, because he wasn’t identified because when he left the community college, nobody approached him, apparently.""

The system’s failure will be discussed by others for some time, but Brown, an Ohio Democrat, caught our attention for his other point on the Jan. 11 TV segment -- that ""laws were there"" already to prevent Loughner from buying a firearm, if only he had been diagnosed.

So we checked with the FBI, the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, the Ohio attorney general’s office, a group called Legal Community Against Violence and the Buckeye Firearms Association, a pro-Second Amendment group. There was no disagreement: A federal law passed in 1968 made it illegal to possess a firearm if you had been found by a court or legal authority to be a ""mental defective."" The prohibition also applied to anyone involuntarily committed to a mental institution.

Enforcement was strengthened with the Brady Handgun Protection Act of 1993, which established the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS, to conduct electronic background checks when individuals purchase guns. Another measure, signed by President George W. Bush, improved the reporting system as it pertained to mental health issues after the Virginia Tech massacre in 2007. Individuals may be released from the federal gun ban if they have deemed rehabilitated and are discharged from all monitoring.

Under Arizona law, it would not have been hard to get Loughner committed, according to reviews by news organizations. ""Arizona has one of the least restrictive laws when it comes to detaining apparently mentally ill people against their will,"" Reuters, a wire service, reported on Jan. 13. ""Under the state's broad involuntary-commitment statute, the government can mandate in-patient treatment for anyone determined to be ‘persistently or acutely disabled.’ That could include a broad range of seemingly troubled individuals.""

But the federal gun law has exceptions. 
The big one: Those who voluntarily get institutional treatment and bypass the need for court action aren’t barred from gun ownership, according to the groups with which we checked. That means that if community college officials, counselors or Loughner’s parents had convinced Loughner to check in on his own, he still would have qualified to buy a gun. ""Just being mentally ill is not going to be the triggerer"" for the prohibition, said Becca Knox, the Brady Center’s director of research.

For reasons that most agree are good, this country doesn’t keep a registry on mental illness. Mental illness is stigmatized enough already, and the majority of people who seek treatment ""will never commit a crime,"" said Jim Irvine, chairman of the Buckeye Firearms Association. ""We have talked about this and looked at it, and none of us at Buckeye have come up with a good solution. I don’t know how you deal with it, because you will have problems on all sides.""

Yet there’s another problem, gun control advocates say. Some people who have been forced into psychiatric treatment by state courts -- and therefore have a record at the state level -- still don’t show up in the NICS system. Only 26 states have statutes authorizing or mandating that their mental health adjudications be sent to the federal system, according to the Legal Community Against Violence.  Arizona does not have such a law, but it is one of nine states that provide the information to NICS anyway, said Robyn Thomas, executive director of Legal Community Against Violence.

Ohio, too, provides the information voluntarily -- but it didn’t until the state passed a concealed carry law that took effect in 2004, according to Toby Hoover, executive director of the Ohio Coalition Against Gun Violence and a Brady Center board member. This was confirmed by Lisa Peterson Hackley, spokeswoman for Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine. The bill that Bush signed provided financial incentives for all states to participate, but no federal laws make participation mandatory.

So we come back to Brown’s claim that if Loughner ""had been identified with this mental illness, he would not have been able to buy this gun.""

Brown’s statement was generally correct. We’ll concede that  Brown was speaking as a guest on a fast-moving TV program where four other people were jumping in with opinions -- not exactly a forum for discussing the nuances of federal gun law.

Nevertheless, his statement lacked the caveat that if Loughner had been diagnosed but had committed himself voluntarily and was not adjudicated by a court, he still could have bought a gun legally. That’s a point of clarification important for a full understanding of his statement",Mostly True,"January 20, 2011"
"""When we look at the number of murders in the United States (in) 2009, we had 9,500 people murdered. When we look around the world, we see ... large countries, the U.K., Germany, Japan had 200 or less killed in a year.""","
After the Jan. 8, 2011, attack by a gunman in Tucson, Ariz., that left six dead and and 14 wounded, including Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., a number of politicians and pundits brought up the issue of whether stricter gun control laws were needed.

One of the lawmakers who made the case for tightening gun laws was Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J. In an interview on MSNBC on Jan. 11, 2011. Lautenberg -- who is preparing legislation to ban high-capacity gun clips like the ones used in the Tucson attack -- said, ""But the fact of the matter is, when we look at the number of murders in the United States, 2009, we had 9,500 people murdered. When we look around the world, we see large companies -- large countries, the U.K., Germany, Japan had 200 or less killed in a year.""

We wondered whether Lautenberg's statistics were correct. First, we'll look at the statistics for the U.S. (Lautenberg said ""murders,"" but the full context of the interview clarifies that he actually meant to say murders by guns.)

According to the FBI's Uniform Crime Reports for 2009, there were 10,224 homicides in the U.S. that involved a gun. So by this count, Lautenberg's number was actually a little low.

International statistics are harder to come by, but we'll report the best data we could come up with.

Mamoru Suzuki of the National Research Institute of Police Science in Japan e-mailed us to say that there were seven gun murders in Japan during 2009. (This was no anomaly: In 2007 and 2008, Suzuki said, the number was 21 and 10, respectively.)

For the United Kingdom and Germany, we had to extrapolate a bit. We took firearm murder rates -- that is, firearm murders per 1,000 people -- for a variety of nations across the globe, then used national population statistics to reverse-engineer the number of firearm murders in both countries. The data comes from the Seventh United Nations Survey of Crime Trends and Operations of Criminal Justice Systems, covering the period from 1998 to 2000. While more recent data exists for homicides overall, we weren't able to find more recent international figures for killings by firearms specifically.

In any case, for the most recent year available, we found that the United Kingdom had 63 firearm murders, and Germany had 381 firearm murders. These aren't as current as the statistics from U.S. and Japan, and because they're reverse-engineered, they are estimates. But experts we consulted said the figures sounded about right. They were also on par with Canada: Sara Beattie, the homicide survey manager at Statistics Canada, e-mailed us to say that there were 179 firearm homicides in her country in 2009.

So, Japan and the United Kingdom were well within Lautenberg's stated threshold of 200 murders per year. Germany's total exceeded that threshold, but it still represented less than 4 percent of the number of killings in the United States in 2009.

We'll point out three additional bits of context.

The first is that Lautenberg offered an absolute number of killings, not one adjusted according to population size. Population differences can be a significant factor, but in this case, the differences in killings are so great that even adjusting for a country's size doesn't change the comparison very much. 
The second is that while the U.S. firearm murder rate is indeed high when compared to most advanced industrialized countries, there are nations that do have higher rates. In the U.N. study, the U.S. ranked eighth out of 32 nations studied, with South Africa, Colombia, Thailand, Zimbabwe, Mexico, Belarus and Costa Rica reporting higher rates.

The third is that not everyone agrees that guns by themselves are the key factor of the relatively high U.S. rate of firearm murders. ""The U.S. also has a far higher rate of murders committed with knives, but I doubt that cutlery ownership is any higher in the U.S. than in Japan, Germany, and the U.K.,"" said Gary Kleck, a criminologist at Florida State University. ""America is more violent than other nations in ways unrelated to guns and for reasons having nothing to do with the rate of gun ownership.""

We still don't think these pieces of context undermine the accuracy of Lautenberg's statement. The senator was actually a little low in his estimate of firearm homicides in the U.S. for 2009, and he was accurate in saying that Japan and the United Kingdom had fewer than 200 firearm murders. Germany's number is higher than 200, but is still dramatically lower than the U.S",Mostly True,"January 13, 2011"
"""Saturday's shootings reflect a disturbing trend. Mass shootings have become commonplace since the Virginia Tech massacre in 2007. There have been dozens of incidents where three or more people have been fatally wounded. Hundreds have died.""","On Jan 9, 2011, ABC News' This Week with Christiane Amanpour aired a special edition from Tucson, Ariz., the site of a bloody attack on a public meeting called by Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., that left at least six dead, including a federal judge, an aide to Giffords and a nine-year-old girl. Another 14 were wounded, including Giffords, who is in critical condition after being shot through the head. A local 22-year-old, Jared Lee Loughner, has been charged.

In a report, ABC News senior justice correspondent Pierre Thomas tried to put the attack into context. ""Saturday's shootings reflect a disturbing trend,"" Thomas said. ""Mass shootings have become commonplace since the Virginia Tech massacre in 2007,"" in which a single gunman killed 32 and wounded many more. ""There have been dozens of incidents where three or more people have been fatally wounded. Hundreds have died.""

We wondered if mass shootings have indeed been that common in recent years.

We looked through some of the major criminal-justice statistical sources, including the FBI's Uniform Crime Report and the Bureau of Justice Statistics' National Crime Victimization Study, but initially we failed to find any published statistics on mass shootings. We eventually reached James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University in Boston, who said he had worked on his own with raw FBI statistics over many years and had the numbers to put the claim to the test.

For the years relevant to Thomas' statement, here are the number of incidents in the United States in which four or more died in shooting incidents, according to Fox's calculations. (Criminologists told us that the usual cut-off in these type of statistical studies is four victims rather than three.)

• 2007: 23
• 2008: 29
• 2009: 27

So, with a three-year total of 79 such incidents, it's clear that describing it as ""dozens of incidents"" is accurate. And the number of incidents with at least three victims would be even higher -- perhaps as many as five times as high. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, 0.12 percent of homicides in 2005 involved four victims while 0.60 percent of homicides involved three victims. If those ratios remain more or less constant over time, then there are about five times as many three-victim homicides as four-victim homicides.

Now, what about the suggestion that ""hundreds"" of people die in such incidents? That, too, appears to be accurate. Using just the baseline of four dead per incident, the numbers killed in mass shootings in 2007, 2008 and 2009, would be 316, according to Fox's tabulations. If the threshold is raised to shootings involving three victims, the death toll could be roughly 1,600.

So these facts are correct. However, Thomas' statement lacks some important context.

First, Thomas suggested that there was a ""disturbing trend,"" which we interpret to mean a steady increase. But if you look at Thomas' three-year period, the number did rise from 23 to 29 between 2007 and 2008, then fell from 29 to 27 from 2008 to 2009. That's not a trend; it's more like what the experts call ""statistical noise.""

While Thomas didn't refer to trends over a longer period than just three years, the numbers for the longer term are murky as well. To more easily analyze Fox's data -- which goes back to 1976 -- we averaged the number of incidents for each five-year period (or, in the case of 2006 to 2009, a four-year period). Here are the results:

• 1976-1980: 20.6 incidents annually
• 1981-1985: 16.8
• 1986-1990: 18.2
• 1991-1995: 23.0
• 1996-2000: 20.0
• 2001-2005: 21.0
• 2006-2009: 25.5

The numbers do show a rise over the final three periods, but over the course of 34 years, the trendline shows peaks and valleys. Viewed over 34 years, the direction is not exactly clear.

""It would be misleading to suggest that there was some long-term upward trend in mass shootings since 1976,"" said Gary Kleck, a criminologist at Florida State University. ""The exact number are highly unstable, but ignoring small, year-to-year fluctuations, there was no trend one way or the other from 1976 to 2009. Further, if these figures were computed on a per-capita basis, taking into account population increases, the long-term trend in the rate would be downward.""

Second, Thomas used the word ""commonplace"" to describe multiple-victim homicides. ""Commonplace"" is a subjective term, and clearly, even a single multiple homicide is a tragedy. However, the term ""commonplace"" seems a bit too strong in this context.

As mentioned earlier, the Bureau of Justice Statistics numbers showed that in 2005, 0.60 percent of all homicide incidents involved 3 victims, and 0.12 percent -- or one of every 1,000 homicides -- involved four victims. Despite the heartache involved, those are, in the big picture, pretty modest numbers.

""Murders are not 'commonplace' in the first place, and mass killings are even less common,"" said Christine E. Rasche, an emeritus criminologist at the University of North Florida. ""We are more likely to hear about them today because of a much more ubiquitous media which quickly brings us news from all over the world. In the past, we were more likely to hear only about local events.""

So let's recap. Thomas was correct to say that ""there have been dozens of incidents where three or more people have been fatally wounded,"" and he was also correct that ""hundreds have died"" in such incidents. But its a stretch to say that killings of three or more people are now ""commonplace,"" and it's not clear that there's been a distinct trend upward, either since 2007 (as Thomas put it) or over the past three decades",Half True,"January 11, 2011"
"Says the person who Florida U.S. Rep. Allen West first hired as chief of staff told people attending a Tea Party rally that, 'We will use bullets if ballots don't work.'","
The tragic shooting of Democratic Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords on Jan. 8, 2011, at a Tucson constituent event is prompting some elected officials, members of the media and everyday citizens to re-evaluate whether American politics has become too filled with vitriol, anger and hate-filled speech.

While the motives of the gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, remain unclear, many have used the shooting to push for restoring civility to the political process.

Yet others already have engaged in a game of subtle finger pointing.

Some liberals have blamed overheated Tea Party rhetoric for contributing to today's political climate. Conservatives, meanwhile, have noted that some Democrats are no better, and that Loughner was disturbed beyond the bounds of either political party. Others also have singled out the media for covering the extremes of the political debate. Pima County Sheriff Clarence W. Dupnik lectured the media at a Jan. 8 news conference, saying that trying ""to inflame the public on a daily basis, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, has impact on people, especially who are unbalanced personalities to begin with.""

On NBC's Meet the Press on Jan. 9, 2011, five members of the U.S. House talked about the shooting, the political climate and the security of members of Congress.

The panel included Republican Trent Franks of Arizona, Democrat Raul M. Grijalva of Arizona, Democrat Emanuel Cleaver of Missouri, Republican Raul Labrador of Idaho and Democrat Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida.

The discussion was at times emotional, and Meet the Press moderator David Gregory began to choke up when he talked about one of the shooting victims, a nine-year-old girl who was elected to her student council.

Gregory then talked about the demonization of the political opposition -- ""whether it's a congressman saying, 'You lie,' from the House floor, whether it's a Democrat who literally shoots the cap and trade bill in a campaign advertisement. Or your former colleague, Alan Grayson from Florida, compared Republicans to the Taliban.""

""I think we're a country that tries to solve our problems by ballots and not bullets, so a good debate is fine,"" answered Franks. ""But when you try to go into an area of threatening debate and things of that nature, then it's very dangerous.""

Wasserman Schultz picked up on Franks' ""ballots and not bullets"" reference when it was her turn to speak.

""Just based on what Trent just said and what, what everyone has said, I agree, it's our responsibility to make sure that we set the right example and set the tone of civility,"" she said. ""But the shock-jocks and the political movement leaders that are out there on both sides of the aisle need to ... have some pause as well.

""I mean, the phrase that you just used, 'we use ballots, not bullets,' the actual reverse of that phrase was used in my district by someone who was almost the chief of staff to an incoming member of Congress where she said at a rally, at a Tea Party rally, 'We will use bullets if ballots don't work.' ""

It's a provocative claim made by Wasserman Schultz, and we wondered if it was true.

Turns out, we've covered some of this ground.

Wasserman Schultz is referring to Joyce Kaufman, an outspoken South Florida conservative radio talk show host on WFTL-850 AM, who garnered national attention after newly elected U.S. Rep. Allen West hired her as his chief of staff a week after the Nov. 2, 2010, election. She resigned from that position days later amid controversy, and after someone sent a threat to her that stated: ""I'm planning something big around the government building here in Broward County, maybe a post office, maybe even a school. ..."" The threat led to a lockdown of Broward schools Nov. 10 and an FBI investigation.

At a political rally on July 3, 2010, Kaufman addressed a Broward County crowd about the need to change the culture in Washington by electing new members to the House and Senate. Her entire speech has been posted on YouTube and is about 10 minutes long. You can watch her speech here.

A few of our notes after watching the entire speech: Kaufman suggested that, without a changing of the guard in Washington, people could be banned from street corners and that ""there would be kill switches on the Internet."" She told the crowd to put the brakes on this ""insanity"" that's been happening, and to get rid of ""these people in Washington who have no integrity."" Kaufman said the 2010 election was the most important one in ""our lifetime,"" and that she says ""what I mean, and I mean what I say.""

She then talked about the Founding Fathers and how brilliant they were.

""They gave us ballots,"" she said a little more than 5 minutes into her speech. ""That is the first line of defense ... We send home all of these incumbents who have done nothing to represent the people. They don't come to their districts. They don't talk to us.

""And then the Founding Fathers were ever so brilliant -- and I don't care how this gets painted by the mainstream media, I don't care if this shows up on YouTube -- because I am convinced that the most important thing the Founding Fathers did to ensure me my First Amendment rights is they gave me a Second Amendment,"" Kaufman said, referring to the constitutional amendment that speaks of gun rights.

""And if ballots don't work, bullets will,"" Kaufman said, as people in the crowd reacted by clapping. One person is heard saying ""Absolutely,"" and another says ""Amen.""

""I never in my life thought that the day would come where I would tell individual citizens that you are responsible for being the militia that the Founding Fathers designed,"" she said. ""They were very specific. You need to be prepared to fight tyranny, whether it comes from outside, or whether it comes from inside.""

Months after the comments, Kaufman tried to suggest they were meant as a metaphor, and told PolitiFact Florida that: ""My goal certainly wasn't to incite violence. .... I was encouraging people to go out and use their vote."" PolitiFact Florida ruled True a claim from Kaufman that President Barack Obama said in a political context during the 2008 campaign that ""If they bring a knife to the fight, we bring a gun."" The line was a quote from the 1987 movie The Untouchables.

(For the record, Kaufman gave her speech at the corner of Oakland Park Boulevard and North Federal Highway in Fort Lauderdale, which is near a shopping center in West's District 22, not Wasserman Schultz's District 20. Wasserman Schultz's district is less than 10 blocks away).

Calling for less heated political rhetoric in the wake of the shooting of an Arizona congresswoman, Wasserman Schultz noted on NBC's Meet the Press that the person hired to be chief of staff for an elected Florida congressman told people at a rally that if ballots can't enact political change, ""bullets will.""

Wasserman Schultz is quoting Kaufman accurately. (Kaufman said, ""If ballots don't work, bullets will."")

Maybe we could all do better by leaving the war and gun language out of political discussions. As NBC News' Chuck Todd put it, ""To political professionals, the use of these images has no impact; the problem is when these images are digested by those who are already a bit unstable.

Four out of 10 homicides are committed by gun in this city.,"
Portland Mayor Sam Adams has thrown out a number of statistics in pitching his five-point plan to reduce gun and youth violence in the city. But this number stuck out: He said at a council  session that ""four out of 10 homicides in this city are committed by gun.""

PolitiFact Oregon would think the number higher.

We checked with Roy Kaufmann, the mayor’s spokesman, who responded with a 39-slide PowerPoint presentation by the Portland Police Bureau. Slide 4 shows that from 2007 to 2010 there were 101 homicides in the city. Of those, 42 involved firearms. On-the-job officer-related shootings are not included. Here’s the breakdown by year, according to police:
  
2007: 29 homicides, 13 involved firearms. 
2008: 27 homicides, nine involved firearms. 
2009: 21 homicides, nine involved firearms. 
2010: 24 homicides, 11 involved firearms. 
  
Because we were curious to know how others died in those years, we decided to check The Oregonian’s in-house library for our own list of homicides. And we came up with this rendering, again, excluding officer-related shootings: 
2007: 29 homicides, with 13 involving firearms, four were stabbed, three died of head injuries. 
2008: 27 homicides, nine involved firearms, a dozen were stabbed. 
2009: 21 homicides, nine involved firearms, six were stabbed, and the remaining     six died of strangulation, drowning, head trauma, bludgeoning, vehicular     homicide and a stopped heart. 
Finally, we checked the Portland Police Bureau’s news releases to track this year’s homicides so far. 
2010: 25 homicides to date, 11 involved firearms, seven people were     stabbed and two were strangled. 

The deaths reported in our review adds up to 102 homicides, of which 42 involved firearms, or a ratio of 4.1 out of 10. All figures back up the mayor’s claim. About four of 10 homicides in the city involve guns. Knives and other cutters come in second, with nearly three of 10 homicides.

Here’s the takeaway point: Portland is different from the rest of the country. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, firearms accounted for 67 percent of 13,636 homicides in 2009. Knives and other sharp cutting instruments accounted for 13 percent.

We also asked Jeff Bock, the Oregon Uniform Crime Reporting manager with the Oregon State Police, to check homicide causes in other cities in the state. Again, firearms led the way, with knives and other sharp tools trailing behind. Of 373 homicides 2006-2009 in Portland, Gresham, Beaverton, Hillsboro, Eugene and Salem, nearly half involved firearms and 25 percent involved knives or other sharp-edged instruments",True,"December 23, 2010"
Georgia and other states with weak gun laws have more crime.,"
New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg recently took aim at the Peach State.

Bloomberg was on CNN several weeks ago to discuss a report that named Georgia among the states with the weakest gun laws.

""Do the states where they have weaker laws have more crime?"" asked CNN's Kiran Chetry.

""There's no argument about that,"" Bloomberg replied.

National Rifle Association spokeswoman Rachel Parsons called Bloomberg's claim ""absolutely ridiculous.""

""If that were the case, Washington, D.C., Chicago and New York would be some of the safest cities in our country, and they are simply not,"" Parsons said. ""Yet, they have some of the strictest gun laws in the country.""

The nation's capital had a higher violent crime rate than any of the 50 states in each of the past three years, according to FBI data. New York was at the other end of the spectrum, the data showed. The Big Apple had the lowest crime rate among the nation's 25 largest cities, the FBI data showed.

But Bloomberg answered a question about states, so let's dig into his claim a little deeper.

The report, ""Trace the Guns: The Link Between Gun Laws and Interstate Gun Trafficking,"" was put together for a group called Mayors Against Illegal Guns and completed in September. Bloomberg, an independent, is co-chair of the coalition. Georgia mayors listed as coalition members include Atlanta's Kasim Reed, East Point's Earnestine Pittman, Roswell's Jere Wood and Savannah's Otis Johnson.

Ten states, half of them located in the South, are listed in the report as having weak gun laws. They are Alabama, Alaska, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Mississippi, Nevada, South Carolina, West Virginia and Virginia.

Bloomberg, a vocal advocate of gun control, filed lawsuits against eight gun shops in Georgia and in 19 other states in 2006 he argued had relatively lax gun laws. Most of the cases were settled. Others defaulted, and a couple of cases were dismissed.

Researchers looked at several topics concerning violence and where the guns came from that were used in the crimes, using data from the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. In each of the past four years, the report found Georgia led the nation in the number of guns sold here that were used in crimes in other states.Per capita, Georgia was 10th on the list. The researchers reached that conclusion by dividing the number of guns sold by 100,000 residents. Mississippi was first.New York ranked next to last on the list, ahead of Hawaii.

The report contains a checklist of 10 ""key gun laws"" and which states have passed those laws and which ones have not to determine which states have weak gun laws.

The laws include whether a state requires background checks for all handgun sales at gun shows, if the state prohibits gun possession by violent misdemeanantsand whether the state requires reporting of lost or stolen guns. Georgia has enacted two of the 10 laws. Georgia requires state inspection of gun dealers. Gun dealers who don’t conduct background checks of prospective gun owners can go to jail.

Some groups, such as the National Shooting Sports Foundation, have criticized the findings, saying crime has ""plummeted"" in states said in the study to have weaker gun laws.

We reviewed two sets of data to see whether Bloomberg is correct about states that have weak gun laws still have more crime. One supported his argument; the other one offered mixed results.

The Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention keeps track of firearm deaths by state. Eight of the 10 states said to have ""weak"" gun laws were in the top half of states with firearm deaths, according to the most recent CDC figures. The most recent figures, from 2007, were adjusted for population. The results were similar from 2003 to 2006. Georgia ranked between 14th and 20th during those five years.

We also looked at the FBI's Uniform Crime Reports, which show violent crime rates for each state and Washington, D.C. Five of the states said to have ""weak"" gun laws were in the top half of states of violent crime in 2009. Georgia ranked 20th. Washington, D.C., was first; its violent crime rate was more than twice any state on the list. The results were similar in 2008 and 2007. The FBI warns against using the data to make comparisons, noting they don't take into account variables that might impact a state's crime rate.

Harvard University's Department of Health Policy and Management tracks firearm research, frequently does reports on the subject and is considered experts in this field. We talked to two members of its faculty, Matt Miller and David Hemenway, about Bloomberg's answer to the question during the CNN interview. Both men have done studies on similar subjects and believe there is a correlation between places with more guns and homicide.

""Where there are more guns, there are more deaths and homicides,"" Miller said.

They said there's less research and data on whether states with weaker gun laws have more crime or states with more guns have higher crime rates.

""Most crimes don't involve guns,"" Hemenway said. ""If there's causation at all, it's not clear.""

So where does this leave us? The CDC numbers do show states with weaker gun laws tend to have more firearm deaths. The FBI data shows some of those states had more violent crime, but others were in the middle of the pack nationally. There are many types of crime, and not all are committed with firearms",Mostly True,"November 9, 2010"
"Says ""John Loughlin voted to let people accused of domestic violence keep their guns.""","
The new spate of political ads that have flooded the airwaves seem better suited to Halloween than the Election Day that follows it.

With haunting music and ominous narration, they sound more like ads for horror movies than political commercials.  

 One example is a radio advertisement from David Cicilline's campaign that begins with the narrator's somber warning: ""State Representative John Loughlin is running for Congress.""

A worried-sounding woman chimes in: ""I heard his ideas are really out there.""

""How extreme is he?"" asks a second elderly voice, full of alarm.

""So extreme that John Loughlin voted to let people accused of domestic violence keep their guns.""

Pause.

""Doesn't he know how dangerous that is?"" a third frightened voice wants to know.

We here at PolitiFact aren't easily spooked; we just like to know the truth. So we tuned out the dramatic flourish and got to work checking out the claim.

The vote Cicilline's ad talks about was on a 2005 bill in the Rhode Island General Assembly -- now a law -- that allows judges to require those subject to permanent domestic violence restraining orders to surrender their firearms.

Rhode Island was the 41st state to enact this law, as part of a push by domestic violence advocates to protect victims.

After multiple amendments that carved out exemptions for police officers and active duty military personnel to keep their service weapons while on duty, the Rhode Island bill made it to the floor in June 2005.

Once there, it underwent several more changes, one of them spearheaded by Loughlin, a representative from Tiverton,  who successfully advocated to exempt on-duty National Guard members from the provision as well.

The House bill passed in a 46-20 vote on June 22, 2005, with Loughlin voting no. The Senate approved the same legislation days later and the bill was signed into law in early July.

The problem with the Cicilline advertisement's claim is that it incorrectly says the bill applies to those ""accused of domestic violence."" A restraining order is actually a civil document that can be obtained without accusing the subject of a specific crime.

""It may be to prevent something from happening,"" explained Deb DeBare, executive director of the Rhode Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence. ""[The victim] may have been threatened or in fear of abuse, but no crime has been committed.""

Nowhere does the 2005 bill suggest one must be accused of a crime to have the statute apply.

Cicilline overstates the scope of the bill that Loughlin voted against. But he is correct to suggest that if Loughlin's side had prevailed, those subject to domestic violence restraining orders would be allowed to keep their guns.

We asked Loughlin's campaign manager to explain why he voted against the 2005 bill. Her answer:

""John is a supporter of the Second Amendment and he voted against this bill because it was too broad and he was concerned that there was no distinction made between handguns and antique collectibles or family heirlooms.""

That may be true, but it doesn't change the accuracy of Cicilline's statement",Mostly True,"October 24, 2010"
"Says Leah ""Vukmir supports allowing people to carry concealed weapons into day care centers, churches, health care clinics and playgrounds.""","
In his 2010 bid for re-election to the Wisconsin state Senate, Jim Sullivan, D-Wauwatosa, is using a slogan that doesn’t even mention his own name.

""Representative Leah Vukmir,"" he says in a series of direct-mail pieces to voters, ""she’s just too extreme.""  

At least five Sullivan mailers label Vukmir too extreme, on everything from health care for senior citizens to state funding for public safety to tracking sex offenders. A recent one focuses on guns, declaring:

""Vukmir supports allowing people to carry concealed weapons into day care centers, churches, health care clinics and playgrounds.""

When paired with an image of a handgun and bullets, and the suggestion there would be no limitations, that’s a pretty strong statement.

Would anyone have been able to carry a gun into all of those places?

As evidence, Sullivan’s campaign points to a series of votes from Vukmir, a Wauwatosa Republican, in the state Assembly.

The Vukmir votes were in support of Senate Bill 403, a measure introduced in 2005 that would have allowed individuals to apply for a license to carry concealed weapons. Applicants would have had to complete a firearms safety course or similar training.  

(At the time, only Wisconsin, Illinois and Nebraska did not have laws allowing concealed carry; today, only Wisconsin and Illinois don’t permit it.)

The bill, after being passed by both houses of the Legislature, was vetoed by Gov. Jim Doyle. The Senate voted to override the veto, but an override vote in the Assembly failed. Vukmir voted for the bill and to override Doyle’s veto.

Let’s look at each of the places Sullivan cites and what the bill said about them:

Churches and health care clinics: The owner or authorized representative of a church or clinic could have given permission to a person who has a concealed carry license to bring a concealed weapon inside.

Day care centers: Concealed carry would have been allowed only for the owner of a day care facility and, for day cares operated out of a home, the residents of the home.

Playgrounds: Concealed carry would have been allowed at parks and playgrounds.

That means of the four places cited by Sullivan, Vukmir supported allowing a limited number of people into three of the them. In some cases, such as a church or health care center, the pastor or operator would have been able to bar concealed weapons from the building. Only with playgrounds would Vukmir have allowed a wider group -- those who completed training and had received a permit.

So let’s take stock.

In a campaign flier, Sullivan says Vukmir, ""supports allowing people to carry concealed weapons"" into day cares, churches and other places. As stated, Sullivan suggests Vukmir wants to allow most anyone to do so. In reality, the bill in question would have been limited to those who obtained permits and -- in three of the four public places described -- applied to a very limited number of people.  That is an important detail left out",Half True,"October 23, 2010"
"""Carly Fiorina, she's against banning assault weapons.""","A new ad from California Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer takes a broad-brush approach in painting Republican opponent Carly Fiorina as extreme.

""Carly Fiorina, she's against banning assault weapons, and that's reckless and dangerous. She's for risky new oil drilling that could threaten our jobs. Fiorina's plan would mean slashing Social Security and Medicare, which would devastate seniors. And she'd make abortion a crime. No wonder Fiorina is endorsed by Sarah Palin. Carly Fiorina, just too extreme for California.""

The Fiorina campaign blasted the ad. ""We demand that she immediately remove this ad from the airwaves and apologize to Carly, and California voters, for not only this deliberate and blatant distortion of reality, but also for her refusal to have an honest and serious debate about the issues during this crucial time for our nation,"" said campaign manager Marty Wilson in a written statement.

The Boxer campaign said they're standing by the ad. Both campaigns invited us to fact-check it.

Here, we wanted to look at whether Fiorina is against banning assault weapons. Generally speaking, Fiorina supports gun rights; she says on her web site that she is ""a strong proponent of protecting Americans' Second Amendment rights."" She's also received the endorsement of the National Rifle Association. She received an ''AQ'' rating from the group, which the NRA Political Victory Fund says means she is ""a pro-gun candidate whose rating is based solely on the candidate's responses to the NRA-PVF Candidate Questionnaire and who does not have a voting record on Second Amendment issues."" (Fiorina was previously the chief executive officer for Hewlett-Packard Co.; this is the first time she has sought elective office.)

The Boxer campaign pointed out that Fiorina has said she opposed a measure passed under the Clinton administration that banned assault weapons for 10 years. The ban started in 1994 and expired in 2004. It has not been renewed.

The Fiorina campaign acknowledges that she opposed the 1994 ban. ""Fiorina agrees with opponents of the 1994 semi-automatic gun ban that various provisions of the bill outlawing guns with military appearance characteristics such as conspicuous grip, bayonet mount and a folding or telescoping stock do not make those guns any more dangerous,"" said campaign press secretary Andrea Saul in a statement.

But the campaign said Fiorina is not taking a stand on any future bans until she sees specific legislation.

We searched to see if there was any current legislation under consideration and couldn't find any. Though President Barack Obama campaigned on an assault weapons ban, it doesn't appear to be a legislative priority for his administration.

Still, it seems fair to think that Fiorina would oppose a ban that was the same as the 1994 ban. The NRA said it endorses her because she ""opposes re-enacting the Clinton gun and magazine ban.""

In ruling on the statement ""Carly Fiorina, she's against banning assault weapons,"" we find it compelling that she opposed the 1994 ban and that the NRA said she told them she would oppose re-enacting it. Is it possible some sort of new compromise bill might win Fiorina's support? It's possible, but there's little to indicate that's likely",Mostly True,"October 21, 2010"
"""When Washington liberals wanted to take away our guns, Chet said no.""","
Jon Stewart, host of Comedy Central's faux-news program ""The Daily Show,"" wryly noted on its Sept. 29 episode that the Obama administration's track record is ""why you see so many Democrats running ads proudly touting their party's accomplishments."" 
Then flowed a montage of Democratic campaign ads denouncing President Barack Obama and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California. The last clip? A Sept. 17 ad for Rep. Chet Edwards, D-Waco: ""And when Washington liberals wanted to take away our guns, Chet said no."" 
""Those are the ads that Democrats are running?"" Stewart marveled. 
On Stewart's cue, we wanted to know more about Edwards' supposed showdown with gun-averse liberals. 
Megan Jacobs, an Edwards' spokeswoman, sent us a statement citing several pieces of legislation to defend his boast. 
Namely, on March 17, 2009, Edwards was one of 65 House Democrats who sent a letter to U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder. ""As strong supporters of the Second Amendment, we were very concerned to see your recent remarks suggesting that the administration will push for reinstatement of the 1994 ban on 'assault weapons' and ammunition magazines,"" the letter says. ""Many of our constituents lawfully own and use these firearms and ammunition magazines that would be affected by a new ban."" 
The letter concludes: ""We would actively oppose any effort to reinstate the 1994 ban or to pass any similar law. We urge you to abandon this initiative and to focus instead on effective law enforcement strategies to enforce our community laws against violent criminals and drug traffickers."" 
What prompted the letter? Jacobs pointed us to a February 2009 article on ABC News' website that quotes Holder saying: ""As President Obama indicated during the campaign, there are just a few gun-related changes that we would like to make, and among them would be to reinstitute the ban on the sale of assault weapons."" Obama's campaign website said in 2008 that he supports making the expired federal assault weapons ban permanent ""as such weapons belong on foreign battlefields and not on our streets."" 
Some background: In 1994, President Bill Clinton signed legislation prohibiting the sale of 19 types of semi-automatic assault weapons — like AK-47s, Uzis and revolving-cylinder shotguns — and imitation models of those guns. The law didn't apply to more than 650 other types of firearms that were manually operated by a bolt, pump, lever or slide action, were permanently nonfunctional and antique firearms. Also, the ban was set to expire in 2004 unless Congress reauthorized it, which it didn't. 
Edwards told us he voted for the ban in '94 after a 1991 shooting in Killeen left 24 dead. He said he opposed the ban's reauthorization because he didn't think it was effective in significantly reducing gun violence. 
We wondered how many Texans would be affected by bringing back the ban. Tim Carroll, a spokesman with the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, told us that the agency doesn't track how many people own assault weapons. 
Carroll also told us that when the 1994 ban was implemented, it did not apply to firearms anyone already owned. Meaning: No one would had their guns taken away. 
Speaking to Edwards' pro-gun bonafides, Jacobs noted that the congressman drew an ""A"" rating from the National Rifle Association, meaning it considers Edwards a ""solidly pro-gun candidate"" who ""has supported NRA positions on key votes in elective office,"" according to an explanation of the ratings on the NRA's website. 
The letter to Holder signed by Edwards is one of 11 reasons the association lists on its website for endorsing the congressman. Other reasons include legislation Edwards cosponsored to repeal a gun ban in the District of Columbia, legislation he cosponsored to extend federal protections to state right-to-carry license and permits nationwide and legislation he cosponsored to prohibit gun confiscation during states of emergency. 
We did not find fresh signs the Obama administration is pushing to return the ban, though there have been reports about assault weapons in the news. In May, Mexico President Felipe Calderon asked a joint session of the U.S. Congress to renew the ban to help Mexico's war with drug cartels. In June, Reuters reported that police in the Texas border city of Laredo seized 147 AK-47 assault rifles bound for Mexico. And on Sept. 28, Colton Tooley, a 19-year-old student at the University of Texas at Austin, sprayed several rounds from an AK-47 on campus before killing himself. 
Of course, Edwards' ad says liberals wanted to take away ""our guns"" — not just assault weapons. 
The statement Jacobs sent us further says that ""since Democrats gained a House majority since 2007, numerous bills have been introduced that require the registration of guns that would limit gun ownership."" Edwards' statement singles out Pelosi and Reps. Henry Waxman, George Miller and Barbara Lee of California and Barney Frank of Massachusetts as liberals ""on the opposite sides of Edwards on many key gun-related votes."" 
The statement cites a host of Edwards votes on gun issues, including: a 2003 vote to protect firearms manufacturers and dealers from being sued for damages resulting from the misuse by others of their firearm or ammunition and a 2004 vote not to extend the assault weapons ban. 
This year, Edwards was one of 159 cosponsors of legislation ""to restore Second Amendment rights in the District of Columbia."" The bill would prohibit the District from restricting a person's right to carry a firearm at his or her home, personal land or business, repeal D.C's registration requirement to possess firearms and repeal a ban on semiautomatic weapons. In 2005, Edwards voted to prohibit the use of federal funds to enforce a D.C. law requiring certain firearms to be unloaded and disassembled. In 2008, he voted to overturn the D.C. ban. 
Still, we did not track with Edwards' logic. While it's evident he's supported legislation that is considered pro-gun and said ""no"" to legislation that isn't, we didn't see anything showing that Washington liberals were coming to take our guns away. 
As we neared completion of our review, Edwards told us that ""the reason a lot of gun-control legislation has not come up, been introduced, but it's been killed,"" is thanks to ""Democrats like me and those who have opposed it."" 
Edwards cited 2009 legislation by Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Illinois, which sought to create a licensing system for certain firearms and a record system tracking the sale of those firearms. Specifically, Edwards said he objected to a provision requiring applicants seeking a firearm license to submit ""a clear thumbprint"" and ""a current, passport-sized photograph of the applicant,"" according to the bill. 
""If I'm a citizen in Texas and I say I'm not about to be fingerprinted or photographed to keep a handgun, then I am in violation of the law"" he said. ""The federal government would have the right to take that gun away."" Those who failed to comply with Rush's proposal, which never came to a vote, would have been subject to a fine or imprisonment or both, but we saw no language stating that guns would be taken away. 
In a letter Edwards sent a constituent in January, he said, ""I oppose this bill and do not believe there should be a national gun licensing system."" 
Edwards told us that he has gone to Democratic leaders in the House and said, ""Don't allow these gun control bills to come to the floor. Not many have. That's my point."" 
Edwards also pointed to legislation he supported to expand gun rights in the District of Columbia, which prohibited gun owners from keeping handguns in their homes. In June 2008, the Supreme Court overturned D.C.'s ban.""They wanted to be able to take guns away, I wanted to stop them from legally being able to take those guns away,"" he said. 
Where does that leave us? 
Edwards makes a case that he’s steadfastly opposed efforts to impose gun controls. However, none of his cited measures would ""take away"" anyone’s weapons. It’s overblown claims like this that keep the Truth-O-Meter in business",False,"October 12, 2010"
"Says that Lee Fisher once said, ""I never met a gun control bill I didn’t like.""","
It’s a quote that keeps on giving, campaign after campaign. It’s even slightly plausible, if you’ve followed Lee Fisher’s positions on gun control. The quote, cited since at least 1994 by gun-rights advocates, political opponents (including the campaign of at least one Democrat), blogs and websites:

""I never met a gun control bill I didn’t like.""

But did Fisher really say it?

We turned to groups that have used the quote against Fisher, including the Buckeye Firearms Association, the Ohio Republican Party and the campaign of Rob Portman, the Republican running against Fisher for U.S. Senate. They all suggest his support for the Second Amendment runs from weak to nonexistent. We spoke with people who dealt with Fisher two decades ago and opposed him on issues in the Ohio Senate. We asked the National Rifle Association -- twice -- to dig into its research archives, although the NRA didn’t follow up either time. We checked decades worth of of newspaper clippings and websites, and asked those who keep using the quote to check their records in case they’ve found it.

No one has.

This has been an ongoing examination ever since the Buckeye Firearms Association and an operative in the campaign of Jennifer Brunner, a Democrat, separately cited the quote during Ohio’s Democratic primary. Fisher won that primary against Brunner, who is Ohio’s secretary of state.

They and others noted earlier references to the quote, and not just from this year. The quote was a piece of political folklore, and Fisher had not appeared to do anything to tamp it down until recently.  We won’t speculate why, although it’s clear that any discussion of Fisher and guns can get sticky when he says he’s a Second Amendment supporter. Fisher has tried repeatedly to regulate guns, whether from his perch as a former board member of Handgun Control, Inc., or from his service in the Ohio Senate, or from his time as Ohio attorney general.

Fisher says that Americans have the right to own guns for protection and sport. But as he said in May on a radio program, ""we should do background checks to make it harder for bad guys, or people who have a serious mental illness to get a gun.""  He embraced assault-weapons bans. Prior to 1993, when Congress passed the so-called Brady Bill to require background checks and a waiting period for gun purchases, Fisher tried repeatedly to get a similar law passed in Ohio.

Second Amendment absolutists and many other law-abiding sportsmen disagree with Fisher.  Critics cite other statements he has made in support of gun regulation, such as this, from a 1993 memo when Fisher was Ohio attorney general: ''The right to bear arms is a very limited right...""

That’s how the Portman campaign characterizes Fisher’s statement, anyway, although the full quote was actually: ''The right to bear arms is a very limited right and the state and its political subdivisions have the authority to regulate the possession and use of assault weapons.""

So we can stipulate that no matter what Fisher says about his support for the Second Amendment, he and the gun rights lobby are going to be far apart. But what of the ""never met"" quote?

When a Brunner operative and the Buckeye Firearms Association used it during the spring primary, The Plain Dealer mentioned it, writing, ""Gun rights advocates as well as Brunner loyalists like to cite Fisher's famous quote from 1994: ‘I never met a gun control bill I didn't like.’""

Fisher’s campaign then said it wasn’t sure of the quote’s origin or whether Fisher actually uttered those words. But the Ohio Republican Party used the quote in an online video attack ad in June. Shortly after, Portman used the quote in a campaign news release. Told that The Plain Dealer was looking into the quote’s origins and questioned its authenticity, a Portman spokeswoman defended its usage, saying the quote had been in circulation for years without any record of Fisher disputing it.

But Fisher’s campaign refutes the quote now. Fisher never said it, according to spokesman John Collins. We have searched and asked around widely and find nothing that contradicts him, nor did the Buckeye Firearms Association, which turned to its own sources and traced its usage to at least 1994.

So where did the quote come from?

That’s not entirely clear, but a 1989 column in the Columbus Dispatch sheds some light. Fisher was a state senator then, trying for the fifth time to pass a statewide  gun-control law. This time, Fisher’s proposal was getting a second look, and then-state Sen. Paul Pfeifer, the Republican who chaired the Judiciary Committee, indicated he would give Fisher a hearing.

Pfeifer, describing the political climate for gun control, told the Dispatch then that Fisher had a reputation of having ""never met a gun-control bill he didn’t like."" Those were Pfeifer’s words, however, not Fisher’s.

Pfeifer, now an Ohio Supreme Court justice, told The Plain Dealer he doesn’t recall details of what he may have said in 1989, but ""if you found the quote, then I probably said it.""

Pfeifer added, ""It’s tough enough being responsible for the things you did say"" in a long political career. ""And it’s hell being blamed for something you never did say.""

Seems fair enough to us",False,"July 25, 2010"
"""Gov. Crist has never wavered in his support of the Second Amendment, the right to bear arms.""","
Charlie Crist and ""never wavered"" are words that don't seem to naturally fit together these days. He vetoed anti-abortion legislation in June 2010 after painting himself as fiercely pro-life. He buddied up to Sarah Palin during a ""Drill, Baby, Drill"" event in 2008, then called for a special legislative session to ban oil drilling in July 2010. Most famously, he abandoned the Republican party after pegging himself as a both a Jeb Bush and Ronald Reagan Republican throughout his political career.

Yet Crist, who has been known to attribute his political flexibility to his desire to serve ""the people,"" claims there is one issue where voters can trust him to never waffle.

""Gov. Crist has never wavered in his support of the Second Amendment, the right to bear arms,"" reads the Crist for U.S. Senate campaign website.

Given Crist's serial elasticity, we wondered if this could be true. Does the so-called People's Governor actually have steady convictions about, well, something?

Crist, a St. Petersburg lawyer who was first elected to public office in 1992, quickly earned a reputation as a pro-gun candidate. In his steady rise through Florida's political strata, he continued to cultivate that image, consistently siding with gun owners.

In one of his first high-profile gun battles, Crist blasted then Gov. Lawton Chiles' last-minute effort to require criminal background checks and a waiting period for purchases made at gun shows in 1998.

""Unfortunately we're in a state that's No. 1 in violent crime in America,'' said Crist, then a state Senator. ""And for us to make moves that would disarm our law-abiding citizens would be inappropriate.""

The proposed legislation died in committee.

As Attorney General, Crist nominated former NRA President Marion P. Hammer to the state's Women's Hall of Fame. She was inducted in December 2004.

In his 2006 primary against Republican rival Tom Gallagher, who supported some gun-control restrictions, Crist put out an ad that called Gallagher ""anti-gun."" The ad concluded, ""Charlie Crist: endorsed by the NRA.""

After he won, Crist continued to highlight his Second Amendment views to trump Jim Davis, his Democratic opponent in the general election.

As governor, he appointed NRA favorites Chief Justice Charles T. Canady and Justice Ricky Polston to the Florida Supreme Court. He signed into law legislation that allowed 500,000 concealed weapons permit-holders to bring their guns to work -- as long as the weapons remained in their vehicles. 
He vetoed a move by lawmakers to take $6 million out of the trust fund that pays for licensing gun owners and processing concealed weapons permits. The national Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms rewarded his efforts by bestowing him the title of ""Gun Rights Defender of the Month"" in July 2009.

Crist then signed a bill that granted protected status to Florida's concealed weapons permit trust fund, shielding it from future raids by a cash-strapped Legislature, in a ceremony in April 2010, during which he wrapped his arms around Hammer, now the NRA's lobbyist, for a public embrace.

Most recently, Crist's campaign celebrated the Second Amendment in a Twitter message. ""Pleased w the US Supreme Court's decision today reaffirming our 2nd Amendment rights,"" he tweeted on June 28, hours after the court ruled the Second Amendment gives all Americans a right to keep and bear arms for self-defense that trumps state and local laws.

In fact, PolitiFact had a hard time finding any instance where Crist refused to back gun rights. We scanned roughly 1,000 news articles that mentioned Crist and the words ""bear arms,"" ""Second Amendment,"" and ""gun restrictions.""

The only hints we found that Crist wasn't entirely beholden to unrestricted gun rights could barely be described as so much as a flutter of indecision.

In 1993, Crist told the St. Petersburg Times he was considering supporting several proposed bills that would impose tougher penalties on youths who use guns while committing a crime. ""I believe very strongly in the right to bear arms, but I don't see a need for kids to bear arms,"" except for hunting or target shooting with supervision, said Crist, newly elected to the state Senate. The NRA gave some of the proposed bills its blessing.

In another instance, Crist bucked the NRA when he appointed Justice James Perry, a self-professed gun advocate who never convinced the NRA of his loyalty, to the Florida Supreme Court in 2009. But gun leaders say the appointment was an unnoteworthy misfire. They did not hold it against Crist.

""He has always throughout his career been a strong advocate for the Second Amendment and the rights of law-abiding gun owners and sportsmen, never voted against us, always voted with us as governor,"" Hammer said. ""He signed every piece of legislation gun owners asked him to sign and vetoed every piece of legislation negatively impacting gun owners and sportsman that gun owners asked him to veto. He has an outstanding record of support.""

Hammer said Crist earned an ""A"" rating as a political newcomer, the highest grade bestowed to a rookie candidate by the NRA, and subsequently received an ""A+"" in future years based on his voting record.

""You can't get an 'A+' unless you have a strong history on our issues,"" Hammer said.

Joe Waldron, director of the Citizens Committee to Keep and Bear Arms, also said that Crist's support for gun rights has remained steadfast.

However, a budding effort to cast doubt on Crist's pro-gun record has begun to emerge.

Crist recently indicated he would confirm President Barack Obama's Supreme Court nominee, Elena Kagan, if elected to the U.S. Senate, drawing mixed responses.

Hammer said she continues to trust Crist. Neither Hammer or the NRA has endorsed a candidate in the Senate race yet.

""I was told he had a made a comment about Kagan before he knew her record and before he knew of our opposition,"" she said. ""We would not be pleased with anyone who would vote to confirm Elena Kagan. We have made that very clear."" 
The Florida Republican Party used the statement in another round of attacks against its former leader.

""Floridians believe in the Second Amendment, and we need a United States senator who will defend that right when given the responsibility of confirming justices who could influence the rulings of the Supreme Court for generations,"" Chairman John Thrasher said in a June 2010 press release. ""The reality here is about more than politics. If activist judges like Elena Kagan gain control of the Supreme Court, our individual right to bear arms for personal protection could cease to exist in this country. Does Charlie Crist still think she’d do a great job?""

Republican spokesman Katie Betta elaborated in an email interview: ""Our main point with this release was to highlight the fact that when the Governor was trying to win the Republican Primary, he opposed the confirmation on Justice Sotomayor because of her record on the Second Amendment, now he said he thinks Kagan will do a great job, despite the fact that she has such a controversial record on the Second Amendment. His position is ever-changing in that it changes based on his political needs, rather than based on principles.""

To be sure, Crist is no Charlton Heston. He isn't even a Palin, for that matter. He doesn't stalk across the state clutching a rifle or claim to kill his own dinner.

"Once the U.S. government signs a U.N. treaty on conventional arms, ""all U.S. citizens will be subject to those gun laws created by foreign governments.""","A chain e-mail making the rounds warns that President Barack Obama's administration is pursuing a United Nations treaty that would be the ""first major step in a plan to ban all firearms in the United States."" Given the controversial nature of both gun-rights policy and United States sovereignty, we decided to do a fact-check.Here are excerpts from the version of the e-mail forwarded to us by a reader, with original capitalization and syntax intact:""While you were watching the oil spill, the New York failed terrorist bombing and other critical crises, Hillary Clinton signed the small arms treaty with the UN.""OBAMA FINDS LEGAL WAY AROUND THE 2ND AMENDMENT AND USES IT. IF THIS PASSES, THERE could BE WAR....""On Wednesday the Obama administration took its first major step in a plan to ban all firearms in the United States. The Obama administration intends to force gun control and a complete ban on all weapons for US citizens through the signing of international treaties with foreign nations. By signing international treaties on gun control, the Obama administration can use the US State Department to bypass the normal legislative process in Congress. Once the US Government signs these international treaties, all US citizens will be subject to those gun laws created by foreign governments.... The laws are designed and intended to lead to the complete ban and confiscation of all firearms....""We will wake up one morning and find that the United States has signed a treaty that prohibits firearm and ammunition manufacturers from selling to the public. We will wake up another morning and find that the US has signed a treaty that prohibits any transfer of firearm ownership. And then, we will wake up yet another morning and find that the US has signed a treaty that requires US citizens to deliver any firearm they own to the local government collection and destruction center or face imprisonment. This has happened in other countries, past and present! THIS IS NOT A JOKE NOR A FALSE WARNING.""There's a lot to digest here, but we'll start by explaining what treaty the e-mail is referring to.Though the e-mail calls it the ""small arms treaty,"" it's been referred to in official U.N. documents as the Arms Trade Treaty. In 2006, the U.N. General Assembly passed a resolution that established a path toward a ""comprehensive, legally binding instrument establishing common international standards for the import, export and transfer of conventional arms."" Backers argued that a treaty would safeguard international peace and security by curbing the international flow of weapons -- especially to ''make it more difficult for guerrilla movements, insurgents and irresponsible governments'' to obtain small arms, in the words of Mark Leon Goldberg, who writes for the liberal magazine the American Prospect and blogs for the publication UN Dispatch.The United States has not always fully supported the process. The administration of George W. Bush voted against resolutions supporting it in the General Assembly, arguing that nation-by-nation safeguards are superior to international agreements. Gun-rights groups such as the National Rifle Association also opposed participation in the treaty.But in October 2009, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced that the Obama administration was open to negotiating a treaty, as long as the final text was arrived at by consensus -- a process that would effectively give every participating nation a veto. ""Consensus is needed to ensure the widest possible support for the treaty and to avoid loopholes in the treaty that can be exploited by those wishing to export arms irresponsibly,"" Clinton said in a statement.That announcement disappointed some backers of the treaty, who said giving every nation a veto would effectively water down the substance of the agreement while also producing major procedural hurdles. But gun-rights advocates were unhappy for a different reason, saying that rejoining the talks could open the United States to one day having to adjust its own gun laws to mirror those in the new international standards. John Bolton, who served as U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. under Bush, echoed the arguments of the chain e-mail when he told the Washington Post after Clinton's announcement that ""this has little or nothing to do with the international trade in conventional arms. This will strengthen the hand of a government that wants to regulate private ownership of firearms.""No final treaty text exists yet. As a result, it's impossible to say definitively that the final version of the treaty will, or will not, impinge upon domestic gun rights in the U.S. Also, the e-mail is incorrect that the treaty would be operative once it is signed. Rather, it would become operative once it is signed and the Senate ratifies it by a two-thirds margin. (For that matter, the e-mail is also wrong to say that the Secretary of State has signed it -- that hasn't happened yet.)But let's assume, for the sake of argument, that the final treaty did include provisions that ran counter to the Second Amendment of the Constitution -- the one that protects ""the right of the people to keep and bear arms."" And let's assume that an administration was actually bold enough to sign that treaty, and that the U.S. Senate mustered the two-thirds vote required to ratify it, even though doing so would inspire a popular backlash among Americans who believe strongly in gun rights.Even if all of that happened, a half-dozen constitutional and international law experts we spoke to agreed that there is solid Supreme Court precedent guaranteeing that those provisions could not be enforced domestically.This fail-safe mechanism is the 1957 Supreme Court decision in Reid v. Covert. In that case, the majority ruled, among other things, that if a provision of a U.S.-ratified treaty were to run counter to the U.S. Constitution, it could not be enforced.The majority wrote that the Supreme Court had ""repeatedly taken the position that an act of Congress, which must comply with the Constitution, is on a full parity with a treaty, and that, when a statute which is subsequent in time is inconsistent with a treaty, the statute to the extent of conflict renders the treaty null. It would be completely anomalous to say that a treaty need not comply with the Constitution when such an agreement can be overridden by a statute that must conform to that instrument.""Our experts -- including scholars from across the ideological spectrum -- added that Reid v. Covert has attracted little dissent in subsequent years, so they consider it a strong bulwark against the kinds of threats envisioned by the author of the chain e-mail. ""No treaty can validly abridge a constitutionally-protected individual right,"" said Kal Raustiala, a UCLA law professor. ""That issue was decided long ago. So the scenario laid out here is simply not accurate.""We found wide agreement that a ""complete ban and confiscation"" of guns, as the e-mail darkly put it, is not in the cards anytime soon. But some of our experts added that over a much longer period, a U.N. treaty could indirectly shape the course of U.S. gun control policy.This could happen if new standards set by an international treaty begin to influence how courts in the U.S. interpret the Second Amendment. The legal positions of other countries have occasionally been cited in court decisions, as recently as May 17, 2010, when the Supreme Court decided in Graham v. Florida that it's unconstitutional to sentence a juvenile offender to life in prison without parole for a crime other than homicide. Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote for the majority that ""there is support for our conclusion in the fact that, in continuing to impose life without parole sentences on juveniles who did not commit homicide, the United States adheres to a sentencing practice rejected the world over. This observation does not control our decision. The judgments of other nations and the international community are not dispositive as to the meaning of the Eighth Amendment. But 'the climate of international opinion concerning the acceptability of a particular punishment' is also 'not irrelevant.'""It's possible to imagine the Supreme Court at some future date using an international gun control standard as one piece of evidence when writing a majority opinion on the Second Amendment, though that's hardly a foregone conclusion.""Over the really long term, do (gun-rights advocates) have something to worry about? The answer is absolutely yes,"" said Peter Spiro, a Temple University law professor. ""It's smart for the NRA to be mobilized on an international level.""But even scholars who agree with this position make clear a difference between the e-mail's claims, which they consider overheated or worse, and something that could, theoretically, happen many years from now. Ted R. Bromund, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, said that ""while this is a serious long-term problem, it is not a matter of gun confiscation tomorrow,"" as the e-mail suggests. The possible long-term evolution of how the Second Amendment is interpreted ""points in the same general direction as this e-mail,"" Bromund said. ""But the difference between what is going on and the claims (it makes) are considerable.""Ultimately, then, it's possible -- if a treaty is passed, and if Supreme Court justices use the treaty as a foundation for overturning longstanding interpretations of the Second Amendment -- for the treaty to influence U.S. gun laws. But it is simply not true that, in the e-mail's words, ""once the US Government signs these international treaties, all US citizens will be subject to those gun laws created by foreign governments."" Rather, in the unlikely event that the president and two-thirds of the Senate agreed to a treaty that banned guns and required their confiscation from ordinary Americans, a longstanding Supreme Court precedent would make those provisions unenforceable within the United States",False,"June 9, 2010"
"""We can prevent terror suspects from boarding an airplane, but the FBI doesn't have the power to block them from buying dynamite or an AK-47.""","In the wake of a foiled car bomb attempt in Times Square, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg went to Washington on May 5, 2010, to lobby for legislation he hopes will keep guns out of the hands of terrorists. ""It's amazing but true: we can prevent terror suspects from boarding an airplane, but the FBI doesn't have the power to block them from buying dynamite or an AK-47,"" Bloomberg wrote in an op-ed for the Huffington Post the same day.Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-Conn., echoed the claim in a Senate hearing: ""The stark fact is that the United States Department of Justice has no authority to block the sale of firearms to suspected terrorists even when the department knows they are about to purchase guns.""Really?Between February 2004 and February 2010, FBI data shows that people on the terrorist watch list went through the background check process to purchase firearms or explosives 1,225 times; and that 1,116 (about 91 percent) of the purchases were allowed to proceed because no ""prohibiting information"" was found such as felony convictions, illegal immigrant status, those dishonorably discharged from the armed forces or people adjudicated as mentally defective or who have been committed to a mental institution.A report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office shows Bloomberg is right: ""Membership in a terrorist organization does not prohibit a person from possessing firearms or explosives under current federal law.""But that doesn't mean these purchases go unnoticed by the feds.When a person on the ""Known or Appropriately Suspected Terrorists"" list applies to buy a firearm, it sets off notifications to various law enforcement and counterterrorism intelligence groups, according to the FBI assistant director Daniel D. Roberts' testimony before the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs on May 5, 2010.""In this situation, in a given investigation, the attempt may, in combination with other factors, lead to enhanced investigative methods, such as surveillance,"" Roberts stated. ""What the attempt to buy a firearm means in a counterterrorism investigation, and as a result the subsequent actions it warrants, necessarily must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.""But if no ""federally prohibitive information"" is uncovered, the purchases are allowed to proceed.Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., has introduced legislation to close the so-called ""terror gap"" in the nation's gun laws. Under the law, the FBI would be given the latitude to deny firearms and explosives sales to people on the suspected terrorist lists. Anyone denied a purchase could appeal to the courts to overturn it. The bill has the support of 500 mayors who are members of the bipartisan coalition Mayors Against Illegal Guns. But it's not a slam dunk. Some legislators have raised constitutional issues with the proposal.""Before we subject innocent Americans who have done nothing but have the wrong name at the wrong time having to go to court and pay the cost of going to court to get their gun rights back, I want to slow down and think about it,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said in the Senate hearing.""There's a difference between losing your rights based on a felony charge that has been proven in a court of law and appealed and is a conviction in the books, and being on some list that's at best suspect,"" Graham said. ""We're talking about a second amendment right,"" Graham said. ""Some of the people pushing this idea are pushing the idea of banning handguns. And I don't think banning handguns makes me safer.""Whether the law makes sense is a political matter. But unless or until the proposed law is enacted, there is no dispute that the FBI currently does not have the power to block suspected terrorists from buying dynamite or an AK-47, as Bloomberg said, unless they have some other disqualifying factor such as a felony conviction on their record. And, in fact, people on the terror watch list have been able to purchase firearms or explosives more than a thousand times in the past six years.

"""Bill White spent his city billions of dollars into debt (and) saw crime rates soar while he backed gun control.""","
In a February fund-raising letter, the Texas GOP’s chairwoman, Cathie Adams, calls Democratic gubernatorial nominee Bill White an extreme liberal with the kind of record only a Chicago politician — like President Barack Obama — could admire. Her letter levels six charges against the former Houston mayor, too many for us to cover in a single PolitiFact Texas item so we've split them into three Truth-O-Meter rulings. 
For this one, we'll focus on the opening part of Adams' blast: ""Bill White spent his city billions of dollars into debt (and) saw crime rates soar while be backed gun control."" 
Goodness. That's enough to make one wonder how he thrice won election. 
Is her fusillade on target? 
Through an aide, Adams said she based her characterization of White spending the city of Houston billions of dollars in debt on an October memo distributed by a group whose leaders include Bob Lemer, a retired CPA. The memo states the city is broke as a result of overspending and the national recession, and raises the specter of imminent bankruptcy. 
The city's director of finance and its former director countered in November that the city is not broke and ""there is no potential for bankruptcy."" Assets exceed liabilities by $1.7 billion, they said, and the city's general fund balances increased from $136 million in 2004 to $332 million in 2008. 
But the city’s debt load did increase on White’s watch. According to the city, the outstanding debts for all municipal entities totaled $9.9 billion as of Dec. 31, 2003, about when White began his first term. The total exceeded $12.8 billion by Dec. 31, 2009, toward the end of his third term. Over the years, debt went up $2.9 billion, or 29 percent. 
The subset of debt payable from property taxes — as opposed, say, to income from the airport or other city services — increased at a faster clip. That total was $2 billion as of the end of 2003 and reached $3.3 billion at the end of 2009 — a 65 percent increase while White was mayor. These include $625 million in bonds approved by voters in 2006. 
Two can play the debt blame game: White has said the state's debt load went up 100 percent on GOP Gov. Rick Perry's watch. We've rated that statement as True. 
What about crime? 
Earlier, we Texas rated as True a White statement about Houston’s crime rates dropping to the lowest levels in 25 years on his watch. The rate reached a 29-year low in 2008, though there was an uptick in violent crime in 2005, the year Hurricane Katrina sent thousands of people fleeing to the Houston area. 
Houston's total crime rate as calculated by the Texas Department of Public Safety fell through most of White's first five years as mayor; finalized figures for 2009, his last year in the office, aren't yet available. 
Houston had 7,054 criminal offenses per 100,000 residents in 2003, the year before White took office, according to the DPS. The rate increased to 7,186 offenses per 100,000 residents in 2004 before dropping through each of White's next four years as mayor, reaching 6,053 offenses per 100,000 residents in 2008. We also wrote: ""These days, few public officials can legitimately take credit for reducing crime locally"" because crime rates have been trending down all across the country for decades. 
The GOP told us that Adams’ claim of soaring crime rates reflects the Houston Police Department reclassification of several deaths as murders after Houston's KHOU-TV reported that nearly 30 violent deaths in 2005 and 2006 should have been listed as homicides. We found no mention of soaring crime in a Wall Street Journal recap of the series. The series is no longer posted on KHOU-TV's Web site and the station's news department declined to comment on the record. 
Next, the GOP pointed to several news articles in The Houston Chronicle. The most recent, published in August, also does not say crime rates were soaring. But it states that Houston had a higher rate of violent crime than any other Texas city, ranking 8th nationally with 1,105 violent crimes per 100,000 residents, based on the newspaper's analysis of FBI crime data in the 25 most populous U.S. cities. Violent crime includes murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault, the newspaper said. 
To make its case for White backing gun control, the Republican Party said White is a member of a national group, Mayors Against Illegal Guns, which says it advocates stricter enforcement of gun laws to keep criminals from unlawfully acquiring handguns. 
White resigned from the group in late July after being a member since June 1, 2006, the group's spokesman, Jason Post, told us. We asked White why he had remained in the group through the years. White said he agreed with the group's position that authorities need to do better in ""tracking down people who steal guns and sell them to people who cannot legally buy guns."" 
White said he quit after his name was listed among many others in an ad funded by the group's political fund urging the U.S. Senate to vote down an amendment (to a Department of Defense measure) offered by South Dakota Sen. John Thune. The amendment, which did not pass, would require all states to recognize concealed-gun permits issued in other states. 
White said he supported Thune's amendment and doesn't support new restrictions on guns. 
Generally, the National Rifle Association gives White a ""B"" grade, meaning that the individual is a generally ""pro-gun candidate,"" the association says online, but may have opposed some pro-gun reform or supported some restrictive legislation in the past. 
NRA spokeswoman Alexa Fritts told us she wouldn't classify White as anti-gun, especially since he quit the mayors' group, which she called ""unfriendly"" on Second Amendment issues. The NRA and the group have tangled on tighter regulation of gun shows and making information on gun buyers more widely available. 
Republican Gov. Rick Perry, who faces White on the November ballot, has an NRA grade of ""A,"" Fritts said, because ""he has an incredible track record on Second Amendment issues."" 
So how does Adams' salvo shake out? 
She's right that White was mayor while the city's debt increased by billions. 
She misfires with her claim that crime rates soared under White. 
Her description of White favoring gun control is based entirely on his past membership in the mayors' group and is weakened by the NRA's generally favorable view of White. White himself says he favors no fresh gun restrictions",True,"March 14, 2010"
"""Speaker Rubio supported gun restrictions that included background checks and waiting periods.""","It's going to be a long summer. It's only February and the barbs are already flying in the Republican campaign for U.S. Senate. (The primary isn't until Aug. 24.)In a recent press release, Gov. Charlie Crist fired off 10 claims about his opponent, former House Speaker Marco Rubio. One statement questioned Rubio's commitment to gun rights: ""Speaker Rubio supported gun restrictions that included background checks and waiting periods.""A candidate's stance on gun issues can be critical in a Republican primary. Some gun rights groups oppose restrictions such as these. We thought the statement merited further research.The claim stems from a January 2000 Miami Herald article. Rubio, then 28, was running in a special election for his first term in the Florida House. The Herald article profiled Rubio and his opponent and recounted their positions on key issues. It said, ""Rubio supports 'reasonable restrictions' including background checks and waiting periods."" It quoted Rubio saying, ""However, I believe we should spend more time focusing on why people, especially children, are committing acts of violence.""Asked about the passage in the article, Rubio spokesman Alex Burgos confirmed that it accurately described Rubio's position and said, ""It's basically a restatement of his support for the current law.""In 1990, Florida voters passed a law requiring a three-day waiting period to buy handguns. When the Brady Bill was enacted into federal law in 1993, it called for a five-day waiting period, but Florida's earlier law took precedence. The three-day waiting period is still in effect, unless the buyer has a license to carry a concealed weapon.Burgos noted that throughout his time in the Legislature, Rubio had an ""A"" rating by the National Rifle Association. Rubio voted for major NRA priorities such as a 2005 ""castle doctrine"" law allowing people to use deadly force if attacked in their home or any place a person ""has a right to be."" Rubio also supported a 2008 law allowing most employees to bring guns to work, as long as they held a concealed weapons license and kept the gun in their cars.Marion Hammer, a lobbyist for the NRA who served as its national president and has donated money to Crist's campaign, told PolitiFact Florida that Rubio's rating would go down when new grades are released in May. That's a reflection of several compromises in the ""guns-at-work"" bill that occurred during Rubio's time as speaker, she said. Rubio's record on guns as a House member is clear -- he voted with major NRA priorities and got an ""A"" rating for each of his elections, at least until now.

"Says state Sen. Steve Ogden was the ""driving force behind business income tax hurting small business, crafted the Robin Hood school finance scheme making property taxes skyrocket, wrote a budget that will result in a $14 billion deficit and voted against"" gun freedoms.","
Huntsville businessman Ben Bius, challenging state Sen. Steve Ogden of Bryan in the March 2 Republican primary, doesn’t think much of Ogden’s performance.

In a Bius radio ad that aired recently on Austin’s KLBJ-AM, a narrator suggests Ogden, who chairs the pivotal Senate Finance Committee, is an out-of-control tax-and-spender.

The narrator says: ""Steve Ogden was the driving force behind a new business income tax that hurt small business. He crafted the Robin Hood school finance scheme that made our property taxes skyrocket. And Steve Ogden wrote a budget that will result in a $14 billion deficit for Texas … Ogden even voted against our Second Amendment freedoms on right-to-carry legislation.""

The spot could make listeners wonder how Ogden got elected in his conservative district.

But is it correct?

Bius, referring us to research footnoted on his campaign Web site, told us: ""We stick strictly to the facts. It’s exactly the truth.""

Let's look at the facts behind Bius’s first claim, which refers to Ogden's role in 2006 as Republican lawmakers scrambled to finance the cost of reductions in school property tax rates.

That year, Ogden was the Senate sponsor of a House-initiated plan replacing the corporate franchise tax with a tax based on gross receipts, part of a package backed by GOP leaders including Gov. Rick Perry.

Bius says in his ad that the tax hurt small businesses. He pointed us to a Dallas Morning News article published last year quoting Laura Stromberg of the National Federation of Independent Business: ""Small businesses operate on smaller profit margins. By taxing them on their gross receipts, small businesses are unfairly hit."" Stromberg reaffirmed the criticism when we reached her, noting the federation continues to favor repeal.

The revamped tax did draw in some small businesses that hadn't been subject to such a tax previously. However, early last year the state released its first study of the tax, which found that while it had shifted the tax burden between some business sectors, overall it wasn’t hitting small businesses unfairly.

Franchise ""tax liability increased for all sizes of taxpayers except the very smallest,"" State Comptroller Susan Combs said, and the tax ""now reflects the economy more closely than it did before... At the same time, the change in the base and the inclusion of newly taxable entities shifted the relative burden of the tax to firms at the middle of the size spectrum, while the share of tax paid by the very largest and smallest of taxpayers declined.""

Last year, legislators including Ogden raised the annual business income threshold for being subject to the tax from $300.000 to $1 million, a move described as eliminating the burden on smaller businesses.

Ogden, defending the tax, said: ""We changed the business tax to make it fairer and more broad-based,"" Ogden said. ""The increased revenue was used to help pay for the $14 billion cut in school property taxes--and small businesses pay a lot of property taxes. So it didn’t hurt them.""

Bius's Web site doesn't list evidence for his second claim, that Ogden crafted the school finance scheme which Bius says drove up property taxes.

But here's the background: In 1993, fearing court intervention to equalize funding among the state's public schools, lawmakers created the so-called Robin Hood approach. It requires school districts that are home to vast property wealth to share resources with less fortunate districts.

Ogden was among a few House members listed as co-sponsors, and was the the sole Republican named to the House-Senate conference panel that finalized the finance plan.

But the legislation was initiated by Sen. Bill Ratliff, who chaired the Senate Education Committee. Ratliff and former Rep. Paul Sadler, who served on the conference committee, each told us that Ogden did not craft the plan.

And two longtime analysts, school finance expert Dan Casey and tax expert Dale Craymer, each disputed Bius's claim that the  funding plan caused property taxes to rocket, as Bius says in his ad.

Craymer, who heads the Texas Taxpayers and Research Association, a nonprofit group representing businesses, was then-Gov. Ann Richards' budget director in 1993. Craymer said: ""There really is no single bill that caused school district taxes to skyrocket, although a number of bills in combination have contributed to a steady increase in tax rates (and sharp increases in some districts) since 1984.""

Bius’s third claim—that Ogden wrote a budget that will result in a $14 billion deficit—reflects Ogden’s longstanding role as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.

Bius cites a 2009 article in the Fort Worth Business Press quoting Ogden saying: ""In order to balance the budget this biennium, which is $182 billion, we used $14 billion in federal stimulus money to balance it. We’re not expecting a similar amount of similar money to be available in the next two years because the federal government just doesn’t have it. So, assuming that’s true, you go into the next session with a $14 billion hole.""

Ogden told us he wishes he hadn't said ""hole"" in that context. ""We don’t have a deficit,"" he noted correctly -- a reminder that when observers refer to a shortfall, they mean that without making changes, the state might not have enough income to fund anticipated future expenses, not current ones.

""That has nothing to do with the budget I crafted,"" Ogden said, suggesting instead that it largely reflects state sales tax revenue lagging what Combs projected it would be by this time. Ogden also insisted he’s not convinced there’ll be a shortfall when lawmakers gather next year to write the next budget. ""It’s very accurate to say the (next) budget is going to be very tight,"" Ogden said, with lawmakers likely to tap the state’s so-called rainy day fund to cover costs.

Bius traces his ad’s last claim, that Ogden voted against Second Amendment freedoms, to Ogden's vote last year against a proposal removing a state bar on individuals carrying concealed weapons onto Texas college campuses.

Ogden, whose district includes Texas A&M University, was among 11 senators (and three Republicans) to vote against final passage of Senate Bill 1164, which later died in the House. Ogden said of his vote: ""I voted to maintain the status quo. What’s that got to do with the Second Amendment?"" He noted that the Bill of Rights in the Texas Constitution states that every citizen ""shall have the right to keep and bear arms in the lawful defense of himself or the state, but the Legislature shall have power, by law, to regulate the wearing of arms, with a view to prevent crime.""

So how does Bius’s barrage shake out?

He’s right that Ogden carried the measure launching the new business tax. But it’s at least debatable that the tax ""hurt"" all small businesses; that was not the conclusion of the state study.

Bius fairly gives Ogden major credit -- or, rather, blame -- for writing the state budget, though he overlooks that Ogden shared that responsibility with House and Senate colleagues.

Bius's ad misuses the ""deficit"" descriptive, taking advantage of Ogden's rued reference to lawmakers facing a $14 billion ""hole"" unless there's more federal stimulus aid. 

Finally, Bius ties his Second Amendment claim to a single Ogden vote. That's a well-worn way of casting aspersions. But without more instances of such behavior by Ogden, it’s a stretch to say his one vote proves him soft on gun rights.

Says Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson threatened to shoot him.,"
Two former state senators are warming up Texas-style in anticipation of a fall showdown over who should be Texas land commissioner through 2014.

Lately, they've kidded each other about gunplay.

Democrat Hector Uribe's campaign went so far as to issue a press release suggesting the Republican he hopes to defeat, incumbent Commissioner Jerry Patterson, recently threatened to shoot him.

Uribe's Jan. 11 release states: ""Meanwhile, Uribe’s Republican opponent threatened to shoot him last week.""

Keeping our own tongues firmly in cheek, we checked into the claim.

Uribe's spokesman, Harold Cook, traced Patterson's threat to an item in the online Quorum Report.

In the Jan. 4 item, Patterson notes that he and Uribe both appeared in ""The Alamo,"" a movie. Patterson wrote, according to the report: ""Hector's a friend and fellow actor. We were both in the recent movie ‘The Alamo’, filmed near Austin, albeit on different sides in the conflict (actually Hector had a real part, I was just an extra). When Hector surrendered at San Jacinto, I should have shot him when I had the chance... ""

""I hope folks understand then we were just acting, now it's a real war,"" the item quotes Patterson saying.

Contacted later, Patterson — who once helped pass Texas' concealed-weapon law — said he was joking about any shooting.

""If it's not tongue-in-cheek stuff, that's a criminal offense,"" Patterson said. ""You're not supposed to threaten people. Does this put me on the (federal) no-fly list?""

Probably not. Especially when it's all just in good fun — and he didn't really make a threat. He just expressed ex post facto regret.

You must list all your guns on your 2010 tax return.,"
It's a scary time to be a gun owner in the United States — at least if you believe some of the claims made by gun-rights groups and spread in chain e-mails.


We recently investigated a

claim made by Gun Owners of America

that a version of a health care bill currently in Congress ""could be used to ban guns in home self-defense,"" and rated it False. We gave the National Rifle Association a Pants on Fire for making

a similar claim

during the 2008 election.
 
So we were skeptical when a reader forwarded us a chain e-mail that claims the following:
 
""Now 'all Guns' must be listed on your next (2010) tax return! As if we didnt [sic] have enough to get upset about! If you have a gun, I hope it isn't registered! Senate Bill SB-2099 will require us to put on our 2009 1040 federal tax form all guns that you have or own. It will require fingerprints and a tax of $50 per gun.""


The e-mail continued:


""This bill was introduced on Feb.. 24, 2009, by the Obama staff. BUT... this bill will only become public knowledge 30 days after the new law becomes effective! This is an amendment to the Internal Revenue Act of 1986. This means that the Finance Committee has passed this without the Senate voting on it at all. Trust Obama ? ...... you must be kidding!""
 
The e-mail is wrong in so many ways that it's hard to know where to begin. But here we go:
 
• The ""Obama staff"" can't introduce bills, only members of Congress can.
 
• No such bill was introduced on Feb. 24 of this year. But there was such a bill introduced on Feb. 24, 2000, by Sen. Jack Reed, a Democrat from Rhode Island.
 
• The bill didn't pass. Indeed, it died in committee, as most bills do. The e-mail wrongly says the law will take effect with your ""next tax return."" The bill would have required people to register handguns in the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record, the government would have shared that information with law enforcement agencies, and guns would have been taxed when they were manufactured or sold. But again, the bill did not pass.
 
• The National Rifle Association wrote a blog post discrediting the e-mail, saying that it was ""recycling an old alert that wasn’t even accurate when it was new,"" and noting that the bill in question ""disappeared without any action by the Senate, back when Bill Clinton was still in the White House.""
 
The e-mail is also ridiculously false with its claim that ""this bill will only become public knowledge 30 days after the new law becomes effective."" Although Congress has its share of closed-door meetings, bills are made public on the

Thomas Web site

. Indeed, that's how we found this one.
 
It's worth noting that variations of this chain e-mail have been circulating for many years. The Web site UrbanLegends.about.com

"The Baucus health care bill ""could be used to ban guns in home self-defense.""","
The Gun Owners of America has recently taken aim at an unlikely subject: health care reform.


In the last few weeks, GOA has sent out several action alerts to members criticizing the health care reform bill that passed the Senate Finance Committee last week. The bill, authored by Finance Chairman Max Baucus, D-Mont., was supported by all of the committee's Democrats, as well as Republican Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine. It will now be merged with another Senate health care bill and go to the full Senate.


On Oct. 9, 2009, the day before the Finance Committee began voting on amendments to the Baucus bill, GOA sent an alert to members titled, ""ObamaCare Could be Used to Ban Guns in Home Self-Defense."" The conservative group speculated about the impact of the health care bill on gun owners, hypothesizing that, in a bid to control spiraling health care costs, the administration will target people who have ""excessively dangerous"" behaviors that officials believe raise the cost of health care. The group warned that gun ownership — particularly keeping ""a loaded firearm for self-defense"" — is likely to be high on that list.


The memo accuses Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius — who would have significant influence over any new health care policy — of having a ""well-established antipathy to the Second Amendment"" because she vetoed concealed-carry gun legislation when she was governor of Kansas.


The Obama administration is so antigun, the group contends, that ""it is even possible that the Obama-prescribed policy could preclude reimbursement of any kind in a household which keeps a loaded firearm for self-defense.""


In this item, we'll scrutinize the claim that the Baucus bill ""could be used to ban guns in home self-defense."" To start, we turn to the committee-passed version of the legislation itself.

 

The sweeping health care bill would leave in place the current private insurance system in which most people get coverage from their employer. But the bill would set federal rules for the individual market — that is, for policies purchased by people who are self-employed or have lost their coverage. President Barack Obama and other Democrats have often said the new rules are needed because companies that sell policies on the individual market are often able to impose restrictions about pre-existing conditions and put limitations on coverage. The rules for the individual market would also apply to the ""small group"" market, which serves smaller employers and their workers.

 

We looked carefully at the language in the Baucus bill and found no mention of either ""gun"" or ""firearm."" So there's no explicit support in the bill for the group's claim.


Okay, says GOA, but guns could still be a target because of the emphasis on discouraging unhealthy behaviors. ""The ObamaCare bill already contains language that will punish Americans who engage in unhealthy behavior by allowing insurers to charge them higher insurance premiums,"" the group said in its alert.

 

The group is right that the bill does allow higher premiums based on behavior — specifically, the use of tobacco.

 

The Baucus bill would allow insurers to alter premiums based on tobacco use, age, family composition and cost differences in different geographical regions. The bill establishes a series of ratios for how much these factors can be used to adjust premiums upward. Tobacco users, for instance, could be charged 1.5 times the standard rate under the bill. (There is no such provision in the House bill.)


Another provision could provide a loophole that allows behavioral factors to play a wider role in setting premiums.


The bill would expand some rules now in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, that allow employees to be rewarded if they participate in wellness programs. Taking part in a wellness program — such as tobacco cessation or a gym membership — can mean lower premiums or co-pays. The bill would increase the size of discounts that can be offered to beneficiaries who enroll in these programs.

 

Some advocacy groups and labor unions have warned this could be a sneaky way of excluding less-healthy workers. And Mike Hammond, GOA's legislative counsel, said that such policies indicate that the bill ""is going in a behavioral direction.""

 

So, GOA has a point that the Baucus bill opens the door to rating health insurance premiums based on behaviors. But the group is making a huge leap to suggest that could mean the government would target gun owners.


In the alert, GOA leaves out two important pieces of context.
 
—

People with ""unhealthy behaviors"" would actually get stronger protections under the Baucus bill

. Currently, states oversee the individual insurance market with a patchwork of rules. According to the Senate Finance Committee, only one state fully bars premiums from being adjusted for any reasons. Seven states allow limited adjustments for reasons such as age, while 11 allow premiums to vary based on health factors. The remaining 31 — a majority of all states — have not passed any laws restricting what factors insurers can use in setting rates.


Under Baucus's bill, the federal rules would take over and put restrictions on when insurers could charge higher premiums as we explain above. This means that for most states, gun owners — or people with other behaviors that the government might theoretically deem ""unhealthy"" — would actually get more explicit protection under the Baucus bill than they have now. Today, laws in most states would not keep an insurer from discriminating against gun owners in setting premiums; under the Baucus bill, gun owners would have this protection enshrined in law.


—

There's no indication in the bill that gun ownership is contemplated as a future factor in premium-setting

. Even if you assume that health care reform is rushing headlong into a new era in which behavior defines health premiums — which is just speculation at this point — there is nothing in the Baucus bill that says, or even suggests, that gun ownership would be cited as a behavioral factor. Every behavioral factor explicitly cited in the bill concerns pure medical issues, such as a lowered cholesterol level, maintainance of a certain body mass index, quitting smoking or losing a specified amount of weight.


GOA's Hammond argues that in his experience, bills that start narrowly have a tendency to expand their reach. ""So I don't think it is unreasonable to assume that what can be done will be done,"" he said.


But we find insufficient evidence to support the group's overheated rhetoric. Ultimately, we find that while the GOA is right that a more behavioral approach to pricing health care seems to be gaining steam, it is a giant and overly speculative leap to say that the Baucus bill ""could be used to ban guns in home self-defense."" There is nothing in the bill itself to indicate that is contemplated",False,"October 20, 2009"
"""More than 90 percent of the guns recovered in Mexico come from the United States.""","
With growing violence on the U.S.-Mexico border fueled by powerful drug cartels, officials from both countries have been repeating a shocking statistic to suggest this isn't just a Mexican problem.


""This war is being waged with guns purchased not here but in the United States . . . more than 90 percent of the guns recovered in Mexico come from the United States, many from gun shops that lay in our shared border,"" President Barack Obama said on a visit to Mexico on April 16, 2009. ""So we have responsibilities as well.""


Obama joins many other U.S. and Mexican officials — from Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to the Mexican ambassador to the U.S. — who have cited versions of the 90 percent figure in arguing for greater U.S. intervention. For his part, Obama has pledged to commit more money and resources to stem the flow of guns south of the border.


But Obama, Clinton and others have left out important qualifiers when citing the 90 percent statistic, which originates from the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The agency doesn't have statistics for

all

weapons in Mexico, where gun sales are largely prohibited; the figure is based on only guns that the Mexican government sent to the ATF for tracing and that the ATF found were traceable.
 
Along those lines, the number was cited correctly by William Newell, an ATF special agent who oversees the bureau's operations along border in Arizona and New Mexico, when he testified before a House subcommittee on March 24.
 
""In fact, 90 percent of the firearms recovered in Mexico, and which are then successfully traced, were determined to have originated from various sources within the continental U.S.""


Gun rights groups say the number has been widely and intentionally distorted to advance a gun control agenda.


And on April 2, 2009, Fox News ran a story on its Web site dismissing the statistic as a ""myth."" The article cites statistics from the Mexican government that suggest only about a third of the guns recovered at crime scenes in Mexico are submitted to the ATF for tracing; and it notes that many guns submitted to ATF cannot be traced. Therefore, the writers conclude, only 17 percent of guns found at Mexican crime scenes have been traced to the United States.
 
According to the article, ""a large percentage of the guns recovered in Mexico do not get sent back to the U.S. for tracing, because it is obvious from their markings that they do not come from the U.S."" The article goes on to say many weapons are coming from a wide variety of foreign sources including China, South Korea, Spain and Israel, as well as from the Russian mafia and other nefarious sources in Asia, South and Central America.
 
""Reporter after politician after news anchor just disregards the truth on this,"" National Rifle Association spokesman Chris Cox told Fox News. ""The numbers are intentionally used to weaken the Second Amendment.""


ATF officials challenge the suggestion that Mexico only sends them guns they suspect are from the United States. In fact, the ATF found about a quarter of the 90 percent were made in other countries and then taken illegally from the United States into Mexico.
 
So what does that mean about the accuracy of Obama's claim? Are the guns submitted to ATF a representative sample of all guns confiscated by Mexican authorities?


In an interview on CBS's

Face the Nation

on April 12, 2009, Arturo Sarukhan, the Mexican ambassador to the United States, stood behind the 90 percent figure.


""Ninety percent of all weapons we are seizing in Mexico ... are coming from across the United States,"" Sarukhan said. ""Just on the Arizona and Texas borders with Mexico alone there are approximately 7,000 (gun shops). And a lot of the weapons that are being bought by the drug syndicates, either directly or through proxy purchases are coming from those gun shops.""
 
Alberto Islas, a security consultant with Risk Evaluation in Mexico City, said the 90 percent figure is based on an incomplete sample. Mexican officials only require ATF traces of guns used in ""high-impact crimes,"" he said. That certainly includes crimes involving violent drug cartels. That's the sample from which the ATF derives its 90 percent statistic. Driving up that percentage, Islas said, is the fact that nearly all of the handguns traced by ATF come from the United States, Islas said, while assault weapons are more of a mixed bag — some come from the United States, but others come through drug routes in Eastern Europe, Africa and elsewhere.


When looking at all the weapons used in violent crimes in Mexico, Islas said the figure of 90 percent coming from the United States may be a bit on the high side, but he said the real number is certainly a lot higher than the 17 percent cited by Fox.


We think the ATF number, presented in its proper context, provides legitimate and useful information to weigh when considering U.S. policy. We find the implication that the number could be as low as 17 percent is unrealistic because it assumes that every gun that has not been traced comes from somewhere other than the United States. That's faulty logic.
 
But we think Obama also mischaracterizes the statistic some when he says 90 percent of the guns recovered in Mexico come from the United States. Not every gun recovered in Mexico is submitted to the ATF for tracing. And so Obama and others can't know exactly what percentage come from the United States. They can only speak to the guns successfully traced by the ATF",Half True,"April 16, 2009"
"""Obama's Ten Point Plan to 'Change' The Second Amendment….Ban the manufacture, sale and possession of handguns.""","

""3) Ban the manufacture, sale and possession of handguns.""

here

, and found it to be Pants on Fire wrong.
 
Some of the other items sound just as dubious, such as: ""4) Close down 90 percent of the gun shops in America."" And ""6) Increase federal taxes on guns and ammunition by 500 percent.""
 
But let's stick to No. 3 for now.
 
An NRA spokeswoman confirmed the authenticity of the direct mail piece, which first appeared in early August 2008. She would not delve into the details of how the organization supported its charges, but we're pretty sure we know where the NRA is coming from on this one.
 
In 1996, as a candidate for the Illinois state Senate, Obama filled out a questionnaire for a community group called Independent Voters of Illinois-Independent Precinct Organization. It asked if the candidate supported state legislation to “ban the manufacture, sale and possession of handguns.” Obama’s answer: “Yes.”
 
The Obama campaign claimed the questionnaire was filled out by a campaign aide who “unintentionally mischaracterize[d] his position” on gun control and other issues, even though Obama's writing was on another part of the questionnaire. (Tommy Vietor, a spokesman for Obama’s campaign, said in an e-mailed statement to Politico, “He may have jotted some notes on the front page of the questionnaire at the meeting, but that doesn’t change the fact that some answers didn’t reflect his views.”)
 
But let's assume, for the sake of argument, that Obama approved of what was on the questionnaire. There are still serious problems with using that to justify a claim that Obama has a plan to ""ban the manufacture, sale and possession of handguns.""
 
For one thing, the question was about a state law. The NRA claims without qualification that Obama wants to ban handguns, implying that he intends to do so on a national level. Obama says frequently that gun regulation should be tailored to different geographical areas.
 
For another thing, Obama's answer on the questionnaire was a long time ago. On a more recent questionnaire, he said, ""A complete ban on handguns is not politically practicable,"" but reasonable restrictions should be imposed, according to

the Associated Press

.
 
At the Democratic presidential debate in Philadelphia on April 16, 2008, Obama said: ""I have never favored an all-out ban on handguns."" His vote in 2004, for a bill that authorized the Illinois State Police to issue concealed weapon permits to retired police officers and military police officers, supports that claim. Furthermore, as a state legislator and U.S. senator, Obama has had plenty of opportunity to propose a ban on handguns, and has never done so.

In a hard-hitting direct-mail piece to its members, the National Rifle Association detailed an alleged plan by Sen. Barack Obama to transform gun-ownership regulations.
 
Obama's ""plan"" appeared on a section of

the mailer

designed to be cut out and carried around in a wallet. The front of the wallet card said, ""Barack Obama's Ten Point Plan to 'Change' the Second Amendment."" The reverse listed the 10 parts of the alleged plan, starting with, ""Ban use of firearms for home defense.""
 
An NRA spokeswoman confirmed the authenticity of the mailer, which first appeared in early August 2008, but would not provide details of what its claims were based on. For that, she referred us to various NRA Web sites.
 
We could find no support on any of them for the allegation that Obama has a plan to ban the use of firearms for home defense. What we did find, and what we suspect is the root of this allegation, was information about a vote Obama cast as an Illinois state senator in May 2004. (See

this essay

by NRA executive vice president officer Wayne LaPierre.)
 
The bill in question was a response to the case of Hale DeMar, a Wilmette, Ill., man who shot and wounded a burglar in his home in December 2003. Prosecutors did not charge him for the shooting, since they determined that he acted in self-defense, but they did fine him $750 for violating the local handgun ordinance. An outcry of sympathy for DeMar prompted the state legislature to take up a bill that would let people claim a self-defense protection for using a gun in their homes in violation of local weapons bans.
 
Obama voted against the measure. The legislature passed it, and later overrode the veto of Democratic Gov. Rod Blagojevich.
 
Like Blagojevich, Obama framed that debate as a home-rule issue. He told the Associated Press at the time that he voted against the measure out of respect for local governments' authority to set gun policy.
 
Here's what LaPierre wrote about the vote: ""When Obama turned thumbs down on the bill, he voted against the most basic element of the Second Amendment — the right of defense of self and family — the reason that millions of Americans own firearms.""
 
That's a bit of a leap. In concrete terms, Obama's thumbs-down was a vote against the state legislature tweaking a local gun ban. In any event, there's no fair way to interpret it as evidence that Obama has a future plan to ban the use of firearms for home defense.
 
Moreover, there's ample evidence to the contrary. Here's Obama speaking at a forum sponsored by WJLA-ABC7 and Politico.com on Feb. 12, 2008: ""I think we have two conflicting traditions in this country. I think it’s important for us to recognize that we’ve got a tradition of handgun ownership and gun ownership generally. And a lot of people — law-abiding citizens use it for hunting, for sportsmanship, and for

protecting their families

(emphasis added). We also have a violence on the streets that is the result of illegal handgun usage…We can have reasonable, thoughtful gun control measures that I think respect the Second Amendment and people’s traditions.”
 
That doesn't sound to us like someone planning to ""ban use of firearms for home defense."" Quite the opposite, actually.
 
Ignoring that sort of evidence, and instead extrapolating from one vote on a jurisdictional debate in Illinois a broad-ranging plan to ban guns for home defense, is not just misleading, it's intentionally dishonest",False Pants on Fire,"September 23, 2008"
Says Obama flip-flopped on banning handguns.,"A new TV ad from the conservative group Let Freedom Ring says Sen. Barack Obama is a flip-flopper.
 
The ad begins with Obama surrounded by newspaper headlines, with the words ""FLIP-FLOPPER?"" on the screen.
 
""People are saying that Sen. Obama's recent changes of position have made him a flip-flopper,"" the announcer says. ""He's not! Flip-floppers only hold one position at a time.""
 
As photos show Obama talking from both sides of the screen, the announcer says ""Sen. Obama is different: He holds two positions at the same time.""

The ad concludes, ""He's 'Both Ways Barack.' Worse than a flip-flopper!""
 
We address other claims from the ad in

this article.

Here, we'll address the allegation about flip-flopping on gun control. (Much of our material below comes from

our previous ruling

on Sen. John McCain's flip-flop allegation.)
 
When the Supreme Court in June 2008 ruled that the Second Amendment protects an individual's right to possess a firearm and that the Washington, D.C., gun ban is unconstitutional, Obama and John McCain issued statements with their reactions.
 
McCain quickly pronounced it ""a landmark victory for Second Amendment freedom."" McCain noted that while he was among a bipartisan (though mostly Republican) group of congressmen who signed a ""friend of the court"" brief arguing against the D.C. law, Obama did not.
 
""Unlike the elitist view that believes Americans cling to guns out of bitterness,"" McCain stated, ""today's ruling recognizes that gun ownership is a fundamental right — sacred, just as the right to free speech and assembly.""
 
Obama said the Supreme Court ruling affirmed what he had been saying all along.
 
""I have always believed that the Second Amendment protects the right of individuals to bear arms, but I also identify with the need for crime-ravaged communities to save their children from the violence that plagues our streets through common-sense, effective safety measures. The Supreme Court has now endorsed that view, and while it ruled that the D.C. gun ban went too far, Justice Scalia himself acknowledged that this right is not absolute and subject to reasonable regulations enacted by local communities to keep their streets safe. Today's ruling, the first clear statement on this issue in 127 years, will provide much-needed guidance to local jurisdictions across the country.""
 
The McCain campaign responded by accusing Obama of waffling on the issue.
 
""Throughout his time in elected office, Barack Obama has taken multiple positions on banning handguns and the D.C. handgun ban. He has stated his belief that handgun bans were constitutional and he supported them. Then he actually refused to state a position.""
 

Silent on the D.C. ban

 
In the months leading up to the Supreme Court decision, Obama did, in fact, skirt the issue of whether he thought the D.C. gun ban was constitutional. He repeatedly said he believed the Second Amendment protected an individual's right to bear arms, but that it does not preclude local governments from enacting ""common sense"" laws to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and children.
 
The main issue before the Supreme Court was whether the Second Amendment protected an individual's right to possess a firearm, or whether it only protected possession of a firearms connected to service in a militia.
 
The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that it was an individual right.
 
Paul Helmke, president of the Brady Center and Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, says the Supreme Court ended up right where Obama was.
 
""Obama has said pretty consistently that he felt the Second Amendment provided an individual right to own a gun,"" he said.
 

McCain's case against Obama

 
But the McCain campaign said Obama has waffled, that he has supported the D.C. gun ban in the past. They provide three main pieces of evidence:
 
• The first is a 1996 voter questionnaire Obama completed while running for a seat in the Illinois Senate. The ""Independent Voters of Illinois"" asked if the candidate supported state legislation to ""ban the manufacture, sale and possession of handguns."" Obama's answer: ""Yes.""
 
The 1996 voter form surfaced again last year. The Obama campaign claimed the questionnaire was filled out by a campaign aide who ""unintentionally mischaracterize[d] his position."" The Web site Politico.com investigated and found that while Obama's campaign claimed Obama never saw or approved the responses in the questionnaire, the campaign at the time filed an amended version, which appeared to include Obama's own handwritten notes added to one answer (not the one on gun control).
 
Tommy Vietor, a spokesman for Obama's campaign, said in an e-mailed statement to Politico, ""He may have jotted some notes on the front page of the questionnaire at the meeting, but that doesn't change the fact that some answers didn't reflect his views.""
 
• The second alleged contradiction comes from a

Chicago Tribune

article on Nov. 20, 2007, in which the Obama campaign is quoted as saying Obama ""believes that we can recognize and respect the rights of law-abiding gun owners and the right of local communities to enact common sense laws to combat violence and save lives. Obama believes the D.C. handgun law is constitutional.""
 
The statement, which came from an unnamed campaign aide, ""was obviously an inartful attempt to explain the senator's consistent position,"" Obama spokesman Bill Burton told ABC News.
 
• Lastly, the McCain campaign notes that in a forum sponsored by WJLA-ABC7 and Politico.com on Feb. 12, 2008, Obama did not dispute a questioner's characterization of Obama's position as supporting the D.C. handgun ban.
 
Here's the text of the exchange:
 
Leon Harris of WJLA: ""One other issue that is of great importance to the people of the district here, is gun control. You said in Idaho here, recently, that ""I have no intention of taking away folks' guns."" But you support the D.C. handgun ban, and you've said that it's constitutional. How do you reconcile those two positions?""
 
Obama responded, ""Because I think we have two conflicting traditions in this country. I think it's important for us to recognize that we've got a tradition of handgun ownership and gun ownership generally. And a lot of people — law-abiding citizens use it for hunting, for sportsmanship, and for protecting their families. We also have a violence on the streets that is the result of illegal handgun usage. And so I think there is nothing wrong with a community saying, we are going to take those illegal handguns off the streets, we are going to trace more effectively how these guns are ending up on the streets, to unscrupulous gun dealers, who often times are selling to straw purchasers, and cracking down on the various loopholes that exist in terms of background checks for children, the mentally ill. ...We can have reasonable, thoughtful gun control measures that I think respect the Second Amendment and people's traditions.""
 

A look at the votes

 
The National Rifle Association isn't buying Obama's ""election-year rhetoric"" in support of individuals' right to keep and bear arms.
 
The NRA says Obama's voting record — which they have consistently rated an ""F"" — suggests he would be ""a serious threat to Second Amendment liberties.""
 
Here's some of Obama's voting record:
 
As a state senator in Illinois in 2004, Obama voted against a measure to lower the minimum age to apply for a Firearm Owner's Identification Card from 21 to 18. That same year, an Illinois state senator proposed giving people who violate city gun bans the right to use self-defense as a legal argument if they were charged for violating a ban. Obama opposed the measure.
 
As a U.S. senator, Obama voted in July 2005 against a bill to prohibit civil lawsuits against gun manufacturers or dealers resulting from the misuse of their products. The NRA contended the bill was designed to bankrupt the firearms industry. McCain voted in favor of the prohibition, which passed 65-31.
 
Obama also voted for an amendment to expand the definition of prohibited, armor-piercing ammunition. The NRA claimed it would have banned much of the rifle ammunition commonly used for hunting. McCain voted against it and it failed.
 
Both Obama and McCain voted in favor of a requirement that manufacturers and importers of handguns provide child safety locks.
 
In 2006, both Obama and McCain voted for an amendment to prohibit the confiscation of a lawfully owned firearm during an emergency or major disaster.
 
According to Obama's campaign Web site, Obama supports making the expired federal assault weapons ban permanent, ""as such weapons belong on foreign battlefields and not on our streets.""
 

On the fence

 
So here's what we have to support the claim of an Obama flip-flop: one answer to a questionnaire in 1996 that Obama claims was completed in error by a staffer; a quote attributed to a campaign aide in 2007, also later disavowed by Obama; and failing to dispute the characterization of his position in a campaign forum in February.
 
It's a bit too convenient for the Obama campaign to dismiss a record it doesn't like by claiming that twice in his career aides misstated his position on gun control. At the end of the day, voters simply have to decide if they believe Obama's explanation or they don't.
 
Finally, there's the question in the forum in which Obama's position was characterized as supporting the D.C. gun ban, and that it was constitutional.
 
Obama's answer seemed like an attempt to cling to his position atop the fence, repeating his belief that the Second Amendment affirms an individual's right to own a gun, but that local governments ought to be able to limit that right.
 
But what about D.C.'s outright ban of guns? Obama not only didn't correct Harris' characterization of support for the D.C. gun ban, his answer seemed to affirm that it was accurate. At the very least, if Harris was wrong, here was the perfect opportunity to set the record straight.
 
By and large, Obama's fence-sitting has been pretty consistent",Half True,"July 24, 2008"
"""Throughout his time in elected office, Barack Obama has taken multiple positions on banning handguns and the D.C. handgun ban.""","When it comes to gun control issues, there is clear separation between John McCain and Barack Obama.
 
So when on June 26 the Supreme Court made one of the most important gun rulings in decades - concluding that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to possess a firearm and that the Washington DC gun ban is unconstitutional - one naturally expected contrasting opinions from the political rivals.
 
Instead, they acted like opposing boxers who both raise their arms in victory after the final bell.
 
McCain quickly pronounced it ""a landmark victory for Second Amendment freedom."" McCain noted that while he was among a bipartisan (though mostly Republican) group of congressmen who signed a ""friend of the court"" brief arguing against the DC law, Obama did not.
 
""Unlike the elitist view that believes Americans cling to guns out of bitterness,"" McCain stated, ""today's ruling recognizes that gun ownership is a fundamental right -- sacred, just as the right to free speech and assembly.""
 
That was a dig at Obama for his heavily scrutinized statement about people living in struggling rural towns. He said it was ""not surprising then they get bitter, they cling to guns or religion...as a way to explain their frustrations.""
 
But when Obama issued a statement an hour after McCain's, he said the Supreme Court ruling affirmed what he has been saying all along.
 
""I have always believed that the Second Amendment protects the right of individuals to bear arms, but I also identify with the need for crime-ravaged communities to save their children from the violence that plagues our streets through common-sense, effective safety measures. The Supreme Court has now endorsed that view, and while it ruled that the D.C. gun ban went too far, Justice Scalia himself acknowledged that this right is not absolute and subject to reasonable regulations enacted by local communities to keep their streets safe. Today's ruling, the first clear statement on this issue in 127 years, will provide much-needed guidance to local jurisdictions across the country.""
 
The McCain campaign responded by accusing Obama of waffling on the issue.
 
""Throughout his time in elected office, Barack Obama has taken multiple positions on banning handguns and the D.C. handgun ban. He has stated his belief that handgun bans were constitutional and he supported them. Then he actually refused to state a position.""
 

Silent on the DC ban

 
In the months leading up to the Supreme Court decision, Obama did, in fact, skirt the issue of whether he though the DC gun ban was constitutional. Instead, he repeatedly said he believed the Second Amendment protected an individual's right to bear arms, but that it does not preclude local governments from enacting ""common sense"" laws to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and children.
 
The main issue before the Supreme Court was whether the second Amendment protected an individual right to possess a firearm, or whether it only protected possession of a firearms connected to service in a militia.
 
The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that it was an individual right.
 
Paul Helmke, president of the Brady Center and Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, says the Supreme Court ended up right where Obama was.
 
""Obama has said pretty consistently that he felt the second amendment provided an individual right to own a gun,"" he said.
 
That position was at odds with the Brady Center's position - which it submitted to the Supreme Court - that the Second Amendment only guaranteed the rights of gun ownership for militias.
 
""We lost,"" Helmke said.
 

McCain's case against Obama

 
But the McCain campaign says Obama has waffled, that he has supported the DC gun ban in the past. They provide three main pieces of evidence:
 
* The first is a 1996 voter questionnaire Obama completed while running for a seat in the Illinois senate. The ""Independent Voters of Illinois"" asked if the candidate supported state legislation to ""ban the manufacture, sale and possession of handguns."" Obama's answer: ""Yes.""
 
The 1996 voter form surfaced again last year. The Obama campaign claimed the questionnaire was filled out by a campaign aide who ""unintentionally mischaracterize[d] his position."" The Web site Politico.com investigated and found that while Obama's campaign claimed Obama never saw or approved the responses in the questionnaire, the campaign at the time filed an amended version, which appeared to include Obama's own handwritten notes added to one answer (not the one on gun control).
 
Tommy Vietor, a spokesman for Obama's campaign, said in an e-mailed statement to Politico, ""He may have jotted some notes on the front page of the questionnaire at the meeting, but that doesn't change the fact that some answers didn't reflect his views.""
 
• The second alleged contradiction comes from a Chicago Tribune article on Nov. 20, 2007 in which the Obama campaign is quoted as saying Obama ""believes that we can recognize and respect the rights of law-abiding gun owners and the right of local communities to enact common sense laws to combat violence and save lives. Obama believes the D.C. handgun law is constitutional.""
 
The statement, which came from an unnamed campaign aide ""was obviously an inartful attempt to explain the Senator's consistent position,"" Obama spokesman Bill Burton told ABC News.
 
• Lastly, the McCain campaign notes that in a forum sponsored by WJLA-ABC7 and Politico.com on Feb. 12, 2008, Obama did not dispute a questioner's characterization of Obama's position as supporting the DC handgun ban.
 
Here's the text of the exchange:
 
Leon Harris of WJLA: ""One other issue that is of great importance to the people of the district here, is gun control. You said in Idaho here, recently, that ""I have no intention of taking away folks' guns."" But you support the D.C. handgun ban, and you've said that it's constitutional. How do you reconcile those two positions?""
 
Obama responded, ""Because I think we have two conflicting traditions in this country. I think it's important for us to recognize that we've got a tradition of handgun ownership and gun ownership generally. And a lot of people – law-abiding citizens use if for hunting, for sportsmanship, and for protecting their families. We also have a violence on the streets that is the result of illegal handgun usage. And so I think there is nothing wrong with a community saying, we are going to take those illegal handguns off the streets, we are going to trace more effectively how these guns are ending up on the streets, to unscrupulous gun dealers, who often times are selling to straw purchasers, and cracking down on the various loopholes that exist in terms of background checks for children, the mentally ill...We can have reasonable, thoughtful gun control measure that I think respect the Second Amendment and people's traditions.""
 

A look at the votes

 
The National Rifle Association isn't buying Obama's ""election-year rhetoric"" in support of individuals' right to keep and bear arms.
 
The NRA says Obama's voting record -which they have consistently rated an ""F"" - suggests he would be ""a serious threat to Second Amendment liberties.""
 
Here's some of Obama's voting record:
 
As a state senator in Illinois in 2004, Obama voted against a measure to lower the minimum age to apply for a Firearm Owner's Identification Card from 21 to 18. That same year, an Illinois state senator proposed giving people who violate city gun bans the right to use self-defense as a legal argument if they were charged for violating a ban. Obama opposed the measure.
 
As a U.S. Senator, Obama voted in July 2005 against a bill to prohibit civil lawsuits against gun manufacturers or dealers resulting from the misuse of their products. The NRA contended the bill was designed to bankrupt the firearms industry. McCain voted in favor of the prohibition, which passed 65-31.
 
Obama also voted for an amendment to expand the definition of prohibited, armor-piercing ammunition. The NRA claimed it would have banned much of the rifle ammunition commonly used for hunting. McCain voted against it and it failed.
 
Both Obama and McCain voted in favor of a requirement that manufacturers and importers of handguns provide child safety locks.
 
In 2006, both Obama and McCain voted for an amendment to prohibit the confiscation of a lawfully owned firearm during an emergency or major disaster.
 
According to Obama's campaign Web site, Obama supports making the expired federal assault weapons ban permanent, ""as such weapons belong on foreign battlefields and not on our streets."" McCain has voted against the assault weapons ban.
 
There's no question McCain has taken a far more conservative line on gun ownership.
 
But he hasn't always been a darling of the NRA. Although for years McCain enjoyed an A rating from the NRA, in 2004, the NRA gave McCain just a C+. The drop was based largely on two votes the NRA did not agree with: one in favor of instant background checks at gun shows (McCain even cut TV ads lobbying for it); and McCain's campaign finance reform legislation, which the NRA viewed as an attempt to stifle its voice.
 
Since 2004, Parsons said, McCain has voted 100 percent in line with the NRA.

"Romney used to favor gun control, and said he didn't want to go back to Reagan-Bush.","Mitt Romney says he is a supporter of gun rights and a fan of Ronald Reagan. But he didn't always tout those positions, a fact that John McCain uses to mock Romney in a new Internet ad.
 
Romney took positions favorable to gun control in previous races in Massachusetts, a state with strict gun control laws.
 
In 1994, Romney ran for U.S. Senate against incumbent Democrat Ted Kennedy. During that campaign, Romney supported two gun control measures: the Brady Bill, which required background checks for gun purchases, and a ban on certain types of assault weapons.
 
In 2002, Romney ran for governor, successfully beating Shannon P. O'Brien. During that campaign Romney said, ""We have tough gun laws in Massachusetts; I support them."" The McCain ad accurately quotes Romney on this point.
 
Also during the 1994 race, Kennedy attacked Romney as a conservative similar to Ronald Reagan. (He didn't mean it as a compliment.) That's when Romney responded, ""I was an independent during the time of Reagan-Bush. I'm not trying to return to Reagan-Bush.""
 
Romney made his most detailed defenses to these apparent flip-flops in an interview with Bob Schieffer on CBS News'

Face the Nation

on Oct. 21, 2007.
 
On the gun issue, Romney said, ""I support Second Amendment rights, but I don't line up 100 percent with the NRA. ... But my positions are the same as my positions have been with regards to guns for a long, long time, and that is that I respect the right of people to bear arms, and whether that's for hunting or personal protection. I sought the support of the NRA when I ran for governor, and I got it.""

A couple of days later, Romney campaign spokesman Kristy Campbell elaborated to PolitiFact: ""They did not officially endorse, but there had been folks doing supportive phone banking for him.""
 
We called the NRA several days in a row seeking comment and confirmation of Campbell's statement about phone banking. Despite promising to call PolitiFact back, no one did. And we could find no independent verification.
 
We did find something funny: Turns out the NRA endorsed a Romney for public office, just not Mitt.
 
Ronna Romney, divorced from Gov. Romney's brother Scott, earned the NRA's support in 1996 as she campaigned for a U.S. Senate seat representing Michigan. She won the primary, but lost to incumbent Sen. Carl Levin.
