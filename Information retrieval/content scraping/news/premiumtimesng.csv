No notification about Otedola’s 5.5% share acquisition yet – Transcorp,"Transnational Corporation of Nigeria (Transcorp) on Thursday said it has not yet received formal notification of interest in the acquisition of its shares.“Whilst the Company has not yet received formal notification of any relevant interest in its shares, Transcorp, Nigeria’s largest listed conglomerate, known for its broad and diversified shareholder base, welcomes every new shareholder acquiring shares in the Company,” Transcorp said in a filing dated Thursday 13 April.Reports claimed Wednesday that businessman Femi Otedola had purchased a 5.5 per cent stake in Lagos-based Transcorp by way of an off-market deal, making the billionaire the second biggest shareholder in the firm.But Transcorp issued the statement in response to a query from the Nigerian exchange, seeking clarification on the said share acquisition.
Any share purchase of at least 5 per cent in a company is considered as substantial shareholding and must be disclosed to the Nigerian Exchange immediately according to the bourse’s rulebook.A substantial shareholder is expected to declare his shareholding to the company “within the 14 days after that person becomes aware that he is a substantial shareholder,” according to Section 120, Subsection 3 of CAMA 2020.Transactions in Transcorp shares started turning unusually large around 30 March, 455.5 million units traded that day, while 287.7 million, 1.6 billion and 117.5 million were traded on 31 March, 11 April and 12 April respectively.Shares in Transcorp had already appreciated by 10 per cent at 14:09 WAT on Lagos’ Customs Street on Wednesday following a rare buy pressure on the stock. The 10 per cent is the maximum daily gain allowed by the exchange.Reports said Mr Otedola had already racked up over 2.2 billion units of Transcorp shares as of Wednesday, equivalent to a 5.5 per cent stake in the company.Nairametrics, an online platform, reported that a transaction of 1.5 billion shares on Wednesday was conducted between the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria and Mr Otedola, the majority owner of power-generating company Geregu and the biggest shareholder of Nigeria’s oldest banking institution FBN Holdings.“We welcome this expression of confidence in the leadership and management of Transcorp, as we continue our unwavering commitment to superior stakeholders’ returns, anchored in our ideology of Africapitalism,” Transcorp said in the Thursday statement, hinting at the purported share acquisition.Mr Otedola has a reputation for surreptitious off-market acquisitions involving substantial stakes.In October 2021, the mogul acquired the shares of FBN Holdings in piecemeal, adding up to over 5 per cent in the big lender at the end of that month, and creating an upset that made him the biggest shareholder in the company.Transcorp, backed by the billionaire mogul and current chair of United Bank for Africa, Tony Elumelu, has considerable investment in power generation, one of Mr Otedola’s biggest bets.",Ronald Adamolekun ,13/04/2023,https://www.premiumtimesng.com/business/business-news/593178-no-notification-about-otedolas-5-5-share-acquisition-yet-transcorp.html
"Lagos Governorship: PDP files election petition, wants APC, LP disqualified","The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and its governorship candidate in Lagos State, Abdul-Azeez Adediran (Jandor), have submitted a petition before the Governorship Election Petition Tribunal of Lagos State.The party and Mr Adediran are calling for the disqualification of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Labour Party (LP) candidates in the election for non-compliance with the Electoral Act 2022.In the petition marked EPT/LAG/GOV/01/2023 dated April 7, the petitioners challenged the outcome of the 18 March governorship election on the grounds of substantial non-compliance with the Electoral Law as well as the guidelines of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).While INEC is the 1st respondent, Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu; his Deputy Governorship candidate, Obafemi Hamzat; the All Progressive Congress (APC), the Labour Party Governorship Candidate, Gbadebo Rhodes-Vivour and the Labour Party respectively are the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th respondents.Besides non-compliance with relevant provisions of the Electoral Act 2022, Mr Adediran and PDP in their petition are claiming that at the time of the governorship election held on 18 March 2023, Messrs Sanwo-Olu, Hamzat, and Rhodes-Vivour were not qualified to contest the election.The petitioners, therefore, prayed that all votes cast for them in the election be declared wasted.“The 2nd and 3rd Respondents, although not duly sponsored and not qualified, contested along with the 1st Petitioner and others for the office of Governor of Lagos State, the subject matter of this Petition.“Similarly, the 5th and 6th Respondents, although not duly sponsored and not qualified, contested along with the 1st Petitioner and others for the office of Governor of Lagos State, the subject matter of this Petition.“The 1st Respondent, upon the conclusion of the Election, declared the 2nd Respondent who was not properly sponsored by the 4th Respondent as the winner of the Election to the office of Governor of Lagos State.“The 5th Respondent who was similarly not properly sponsored by the 6th Respondent was declared by the 1st Respondent as having scored the second highest number of votes at the Election to the office of Governor of Lagos State,” the petition reads in part.The petitioners said that the petition bothered on four grounds of non-compliance warranting disqualification of Messrs Sanwo-Olu and Hamzat declared as the winner of the election by INEC.Mr Adediran and the PDP added that the petition also bothered on another four grounds of non-compliance warranting disqualification of Mr Rhodes-Vivour who was declared to have scored the second-highest number of votes in the election.The petitioners said that APC did not comply with the INEC Time Table and Schedule of Activities for the 2023 General Election which stipulated that all political parties must give 21 days’ notice to INEC before the conduct of the primary election.They added that such notice must emanate from the national office of the political party and be signed by its National Chairman and National Secretary.“Contrary to this provision, the Lagos state chapter of the APC through her letter dated 24th May 2022 notified the State Resident Electoral Commissioner of the party primary election held on 26th May 2022., with details of venue of the said primary.“The notification from the state chapter of APC was therefore invalid, null and void according to the Electoral Act 2022,” it read in part.The petitioners added that the APC also failed to comply with the requirement of the Electoral Act 2022 that every political party sponsoring a candidate in the general election shall submit the nomination form of such candidate(s) not later than 180 days before the conduct of the general election in forms EC9.
The petitioners also cited the omission of the Oath page in Form EC9 for the 3rd respondent, (Hamzat), which would have shown that it was not endorsed by the Commissioner for Oath within the time prescribed by the Electoral Law 2022 and without the oath page, the entire form EC9 and the information therein are worthless.Mr Adediran and PDP added that Mr Sanwo-Olu failed to attach a copy of the GCE O’Level result he claimed to have sat for in 1981 along with his form EC9 as required by the Electoral Act 2022.The petition read in part: “This development sparked a curiosity, with Adediran and PDP applying for the CTC of Governor Sanwo-Olu 2019 from CF001.“It was then discovered that a Statement of Result issued by Ijebu Ife Community Grammar School, Ijebu-Ife for May/June 1981 GCE O’ Level Examination with examination number 17624/118 which he submitted for his first term election as governor of the state was not confirmed by WAEC.“When JANDOR and PDP approached WAEC for confirmation, they were directed to purchase the scratch card for verification of WAEC result scratch card, which then confirmed the results as not emanating from WAEC, it came back to be a fake result.”The petitioners also hinged the disqualification of the governorship candidate of LP’s Rhodes-Vivour on his non-compliance of the party with the requirements of the Electoral Law in the conduct of the primary election that produced the candidate.Mr Adediran and PDP said that the notice of the primary election was issued by the state chapter of LP as against the provision that it must be issued and signed by the National Chairman and Secretary of the party.The petitioners added that the LP used Statutory Delegates who are members of the Lagos State EXCO/Caretaker Committee in the conduct of her substitution primary election on Aug. 10, 2022 contrary to the provision of the Electoral Act 2022.The petitioners also said that Form EC9 for Rhodes-Vivour was signed under oath and submitted to INEC on the 4th of July 2022, exactly 37 days before the holding of the substitution primary election on Aug. 10, 2022, that produced him as the candidate of the Labour Party.It further read: “This makes his nomination invalid. Furthermore, Rhodes-Vivour was still a member of PDP as of June 18, 2022 when he claimed, again under oath to having registered as a member of the Labour Party.“Documentary evidence and newspaper report establishing his participation in the screening exercise for the running mate to the governorship candidate of the Lagos PDP, Dr Abdul-Azeez Olajide Adediran (JANDOR), on June 22, 2022, was provided in the petition.
“In line with the provision of the Electoral Act, the candidate for the office of Governor of Lagos State is not allowed to be a member of more than one political party at the time of being sponsored as a candidate for the general election, therefore his nomination is invalid.”Mr Adediran and PDP thus prayed the Election Petition Tribunal to declare all the votes cast for APC and Labour Party in the 18 March governorship election as wasted votes since their candidates were not qualified to have participated in the election.The petitioners added that since PDP scored the third-highest number of votes in the election and having satisfied the provisions of the Electoral Act 2022, Adediran (Jandor) of the PDP was the validly qualified candidate to be returned as the winner of the said election.The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Mr Sanwo-Olu defeated 15 other contestants from various parties to emerge as the winner of the election.Mr Sanwo-Olu polled 762,134 votes to defeat his closest rival of the Labour Party, Mr Gbadebo Rhodes-Vivour who scored 312,329 votes in the election.The PDP candidate, Mr Adediran, garnered 62,449 votes to come third in the poll.(NAN)",Agency Report ,11/04/2023,https://www.premiumtimesng.com/regional/ssouth-west/592696-lagos-governorship-pdp-files-election-petition-wants-apc-lp-disqualified.html
"Tinubu: APC asks election tribunal to dismiss Obi, LP’s petition, gives reasons","The All Progressives Congress (APC), on Monday, asked the Presidential Election Petition Court (PEPC) in Abuja to dismiss the petition filed by the Labour Party (LP) and its presidential candidate, Peter Obi, against the emergence of Bola Tinubu as the president-elect in the 25 February election.The APC, the 4th respondent, urged the PEPC to reject the petition in its notice of preliminary objection marked: CA/PEPC/03/2023 and filed at PEPC’s Secretariat, Monday night, by Thomas Ojo, a member of the party’s legal team led by Lateef Fagbemi in Abuja.The party asked the tribunal to dismiss the petition with substantial cost on the grounds that it lacked merit and was frivolous.The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Mr Obi, the 1st petitioner, and LP, the 2nd petitioner, had sued the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Mr Tinubu, Kashim Shettima and APC as 1st to 4th respondents respectively.The petitioners are seeking the nullification of the election victory of Messrs Tinubu and Shettima in the 25 February presidential poll.NAN reports that while former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) came second with 6,984,520 votes in the election. Mr Obi came third with 6,101,533 votes.Atiku and the PDP are also challenging the outcome of the poll.In the petition marked: CA/PEPC/03/2023 filed by Mr Obi and LP’s lead counsel, Livy Ozoukwu, they contended that Mr Tinubu “was not duly elected by majority of the lawful votes cast at the time of the election.”The petitioners claimed there was rigging in 11 states, adding that they would demonstrate this in the declaration of results based on the uploaded results.Mr Obi and LP said INEC violated its own regulations when it announced the result despite the fact that at the time of the announcement, the totality of the polling unit results had yet to be fully scanned, uploaded and transmitted electronically as required by the Electoral Act.Among other prayers, the petitioners urged the tribunal to “determine that, at the time of the presidential election held on February 25, 2023, the 2nd and 3rd respondents (Tinubu and Shettima) were not qualified to contest the election.“That it be determined that all the votes recorded for the 2nd respondent in the election are wasted votes, owing to the non-qualification of the 2nd and 3rd respondents.“That it be determined that on the basis of the remaining votes (after discountenancing the votes credited to the 2nd respondent) the 1st petitioner (Obi) scored a majority of the lawful votes cast at the election and had not less than 25 per cent of the votes cast in each of at least two-thirds of the states of the federation and the FCT and satisfied the constitutional requirements to be declared the winner of the Feb. 25 presidential election.“That it be determined that the 2nd respondent (Tinubu), having failed to score one-quarter of the votes cast at the presidential election in the FCT was not entitled to be declared and returned as the winner of the presidential election held on Feb. 25.”Responding, the APC asked the court to dismiss the suit on the ground that Mr Obi, the 1st petitioner, lacked requisite “locus standi” to institute the petition because he was not a member of LP at least 30 days to the party’s presidential primary to be validly sponsored by the party.It said: “The 1st petitioner (Obi) was a member of PDP until May 24, 2022.“1st petitioner was screened as a presidential aspirant of the PDP in Apni 2022.
“1st petitioner participated and was cleared to contest the presidential election while being a member of the PDP.“1st petitioner purportedly resigned his membership of PDP on May 24, 2022 to purportedly join the 2nd petitioner (Labour Party) on May 27, 2022.“2nd petitioner conducted its presidential primary on May 30, 2022 which purportedly produced 1st petitioner as its candidate, which time contravened Section 77(3) of the Electoral Act for him to contest the primary election as a member of the 2nd petitioner.”The party argued that Obi was not a member of LP at the time of his alleged sponsorship.The APC argued that “by the mandatory provisions of Section 77 (1) (2) and (3) of the Electoral Act 2022, a political party shall maintain a register and shall make such register available to INEC not later than 30 days before the date fixed for the party primaries, congresses and convention.”It stated further that all the PDP’s presidential candidates were screened on 29 April 29, an exercise Mr Obi participated in and cleared to contest while being a member of the party.It argued that the petition was incompetent since Mr Obi’s name could not have been in LP’s register made available to INEC at the time he joined the party.The APC equally argued that the petition was improperly constituted having failed to join Atiku Abubakar and PDP who were necessary parties to be affected by the reliefs sought“By Paragraph 17 of the petition, the petitioners, on their own, stated that Alhaji Atiku Abubakar came second in the presidential election with 6,984,520 votes as against the petitioners who came third with 6,101,533 votes;“At Paragraph 102 (ii) of the petition, the petitioners urged the tribunal to determine that 1st petitioner scored the majority of lawful votes without joining Alhaji Atiku Abubakar in the petition.“For the tribunal to grant prayer (iii) of the petitioners, the tribunal must have set aside the scores and election of Alhaji Atiku Abubakar,
“Alhaji Atiku Abubakar must be heard before his votes can be discountenanced by the tribunal,” it said.The party said the petition and the identified paragraphs were in breach of the mandatory provisions of Paragraph 4(1)(D) of the 1st Schedule to the Electoral Act, 2022.According to APC, Paragraphs 60 — 77 of the petition are non-specific, vague and/or nebulous and thereby incompetent contrary to Paragraph 4(1)(d) of the Ist Schedule to the Electoral Act, 2022.It said that the allegations of non-compliance must be made distinctly and proved on a polling unit basis but none was specified or provided in any of the paragraphs of the petition.“Paragraphs 59-60 of the petition disclose no identity or particulars of scores and polling units supplied in 18,088 units mentioned therein,” it added.The party, therefore, argued that the tribunal lacked the requisite jurisdiction to entertain pre-election complaints embedded in the petition as presently constituted, among other arguments.The APC urged the tribunal to dismiss the petition with substantial cost as the same was devoid of any merit and founded on frivolity.(NAN)",Agency Report ,11/04/2023,https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/592693-tinubu-apc-asks-election-tribunal-to-dismiss-obi-lps-petition-gives-reasons.html
DATA: What the voting pattern in 2023 presidential election is telling us,"On February 25, Nigerians went to the polls to elect their preferred presidential candidates in the seventh general election since the end of military rule in 1999.Since the beginning of the Fourth Republic, Nigeria has enjoyed uninterrupted democracy for 24 years, the longest stretch since its independence in 1960. Up to 93 million people in Africa’s most populous country and biggest economy registered to vote ahead of the 2023 elections.The election produced Bola Tinubu, the candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), as Nigeria’s next president, extending the APC’s rule in Africa’s largest democracy.Mr Tinubu, 70, scored 8,794,726 votes. His closest rival, Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), scored 6,984,520 votes to emerge second in the election. Labour Party’s Peter Obi got a total of 6,101,533 votes while Rabiu Kwankwaso of the NNPP came fourth with 1,496,687 votes.The national voter turnout was 29 per cent; no election had a lower participation rate in the six decades of Nigeria’s independence. Of the 93.4 million registered voters this year, 87.2 million people collected their Permanent Voters Card while the total number of actual voters on election day was only 24.9 million. Barely 9 million people voted for President-elect Tinubu to govern 220 million Nigerians.In each of the 36 states, less than half of the eligible population turned out to vote, and only Jigawa State had a turnout above 40 per cent. While the northwestern state had a 41 per cent turnout, Plateau State recorded a 40 per cent turnout.In the three largest states based on voter registration — Lagos, Kano and Rivers — less than a third of the eligible population voted. Rivers turnout was a shameful 16 per cent, the lowest in the country, despite producing a lot more votes in past elections, which though were criticised as violent and irregular by observers.Only about ten states recorded more than 30 per cent turnout and participation in other states was a little more than 20 per cent.Election participation in Osun was 39 per cent. This was followed by Adamawa – 35 per cent, Gombe – 34 per cent, Bauchi – 32 per cent, Ekiti – 32 per cent, Kaduna – 32 per cent, Katsina – 31 per cent, FCT – 30 per cent, and Niger – 30 per cent.Voter turnout in each of Benue, Kano, Kebbi, Kwara, and Nasarawa states was 29 per cent. Ondo and Sokoto states recorded 28 per cent turnout each.On the other hand, Zamfara had 27 per cent followed by Oyo at 26 per cent; Taraba at 26 per cent; Akwa Ibom at 25 per cent; and Kogi at 25 per cent.Meanwhile, the trio of Anambra, Cross River and Edo had a 24 per cent turnout performance. Southwestern Ogun State recorded 23 per cent; Enugu 22 per cent; Ebonyi 21 per cent; Borno 20 per cent; Delta 20 per cent; and Imo 20 per cent.Lagos, Nigeria’s most populous state and the state with the highest number of eligible voters recorded an abysmal 19 per cent voter turnout amid reports of violence and voter suppression. The state was just a little above southeast Abia state where turnout was 18 per cent.Participation was worse in Bayelsa and Rivers states with only 16 per cent of people turning out to vote in the oil-rich states.Although less than a third of the eligible population voted in Kano, the state had the highest number of votes with 1.74 million total votes cast. This was followed by Kaduna where 1.4 million people voted.The total votes cast in Lagos was 1.3 million; Plateau 1.1 million and 1.09 million in Katsina.Only the five aforementioned states recorded more than one million votes in the 25 February presidential elections.
Total votes in Jigawa was 954,805; Bauchi 882,546, Oyo 851,956, Niger 813,355, and Benue 797,762.Official data shows that at the bottom of the list is Imo State with 478,652 total votes; Kogi with 476,038 votes, Enugu – 468,891 votes, Cross River – 416,968, Yobe – 397,331, Abia – 381,683, Ebonyi – 337,341, and Ekiti – 314,472.Bayelsa State had the least number of votes cast with 173,111.With 26.5 per cent, the North-west had the highest proportion of votes cast in the presidential election. This was followed by North-central with 17.2 per cent; South-west with 16.3 per cent; North-east with 13.2 per cent; South-south with 11 per cent; and South-east with 8.7 per cent.In terms of volume, the North-west had the highest number of votes with about 6.6 million votes, followed by the North-central with above 4.5 million votes.The South-west, with about 4.25 million votes, placed third, while the North-east followed with about 3.4 million votes.The South-south had 2.85 million and the South-east 2.2 million votes.Bola Tinubu, the candidate of the APC secured the highest number of votes and a breakdown of data shows that he gained more votes than his rivals in three out of the six geopolitical zones. Mr Tinubu won in his South-west home; North-west and North-central.In the three other regions he didn’t win, the former Lagos governor came second. This gave him the spread to be the only candidate that gained 25 per cent of votes in 29 states. Mr Tinubu also won at least one state in each of the regions except South-east.LP’s Mr Obi won two regions (South-east and South-south) while PDP’s Atiku scored more votes in only one region (North-east).

PDP’s Atiku came second with 941,941 votes (21 per cent) and won in one state while Mr Obi finished third in the South-west, gaining 19.5 per cent of the votes and winning in one state.Then in the North-east, former vice president Atiku got 1.7 million votes (56 per cent). The PDP candidate won five out of six states in the region. Mr Tinubu scored 1.1 million votes (32 per cent) while Mr Obi got 315,107 votes (10 per cent).In the South-south, Mr Obi got 1.2 million (44 per cent) votes, followed by Mr Tinubu with 799,957 votes (29 per cent) and Atiku with 717,908 votes (26 per cent).Labour Party candidate Mr Obi won all five states in the South-east.

Both states have a total of 21 LGAs each.In Adamawa, the elections will be held in a total of 69 polling units (PUs) and 142 PUs in Kebbi states with 36,935 and 94,209 eligible voters, respectively.

Code of Conduct Bureau invites Keyamo over petition against Atiku,"The Code of Conduct Bureau (CCB) has commenced action on the petition filed by the Minister of State for Labour and Employment, Festus Keyamo, against former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar.Mr Keyamo, a spokesperson for the campaign council of the president-elect, Bola Tinubu, had in a petition filed in January, called for an investigation into the corruption allegations levelled against Atiku by a former aide, Michael Achimugu.PREMIUM TIMES reported that Mr Keyamo sent the petition to several anti-graft agencies, including the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Independent Corrupt Practices and other related offences Commission (ICPC) and CCB.Mr Keyamo, on 16 January, gave the anti-graft agencies 72 hours to investigate, arrest and prosecute the PDP presidential candidate.The CCB, in a letter dated 28 March and signed by its Director of Intelligence, Investigation and Monitoring, Sebastian Gwimi, asked Mr Keyamo to appear at the bureau’s office in Abuja to adopt his petition.Mr Keyamo is scheduled to appear before the CCB on Friday 21 April.“This invitation is to enable you adopt the aforementioned petition and to provide any additional information that may be material to this investigation.“You are requested to come along with one Michael Achimugu, to assist with enquiries regarding the attachments to your petition,” the letter reads.Mr Achimugu, who claimed to be a former aide of Atiku, in a series of social media posts, accused Atiku of using Special Purpose Vehicles (SPV) to commit financial fraud.Mr Keyamo, at the end of the expiration of the 72 hours ultimatum, filed a suit at the Federal High Court in Abuja seeking an order compelling the security agencies to arrest Atiku.The minister shared the CCB’s invitation letter and a statement from his law firm, Festus Keyamo Chambers on the matter via his Twitter timeline on Thursday.The statement, issued by John Anietor, said Mr Keyamo will see the case to a logical conclusion, noting that it is not a political gimmick.“The Bureau has invited our client Mr Festus Keyamo to come forward to adopt his petition and to help it to secure the presence of the whistleblower, Mr Michael Achimugu to assist in the investigation. See a copy of the letter below.“Mr Keyamo assures that the crusade for accountability in respect of this issue was not a campaign gimmick as he promises to follow it through to a logical conclusion, even after the victory of the President-Elect, ASIWAJU Bola Ahmed Tinubu,” he said.Daniel Bwala, the spokesperson for the Atiku Campaign, told PREMIUM TIMES that the invitation by the CCB was a formality to allow Mr Keyamo to adopt his petition.He described the petition as “frivolous”, “fictitious” and “dead on arrival”.He added that Mr Keyamo wrote the petition ahead of the election “for the optics and nothing more”.

ANALYSIS: Politicians facing bleak future after 2023 elections,"The 2023 general elections are over, save for some supplementary polls arising from inconclusive elections that have been scheduled for 15 April by INEC. The country has a new president-elect and a vice president-elect on the platform of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). They will be sworn into office on 29 May, thus drawing the curtain on the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari.Those who want to be principal officials of the 10th National Assembly have started declaring their intentions spinning all kinds of permutations and making subterranean alignments and realignments even when the APC is yet to decide which of the geopolitical zones will produce the principal officials, especially the Senate President and Speaker of the House of Representatives. The ruling party has simple majority control in the two chambers.At the sub-national level, 26 new governors-elect and deputy governors-elect as well as state lawmakers in all the 36 states of the federation have also emerged. Two states, Adamawa and Kebbi, have inconclusive governorship elections, which are among those to be settled on 15 April.By the time the results of the 2019 elections were announced, the PDP was swept out of power by the APC, leaving nothing for Mr Saraki, who is the leader of the dynasty, bequeathed to him by his late father, Olusola Saraki. Again, ‘Otoge part two’ also reaffirmed what happened in 2019 in the just concluded 2023 general elections as the APC again proved its mettle as the ruling party in the state.There are commentators who say that is the end of the Saraki dynasty in the state as new forces have completely taken over the leadership of the state. As far as the moment is concerned, they are correct but the dynasty may yet make a comeback through another Saraki in the future.While losing at home may be considered a temporary setback, the PDP also lost out in the presidential election, which implies that Mr Saraki, a former two-term governor of Kwara State, has no secure political future in the interim and some time to come. It may also be the beginning of the end for him as far as partisan politics is concerned.The immediate past minister of transportation has been holding one political office after the other since the country returned to civil rule in 1999.He was speaker of the Rivers State House of Assembly for two terms and also became governor of the state for two terms of eight years, succeeding his erstwhile godfather, Peter Odili, who facilitated his entry into partisan politics.Just while he was about to serve out his second term in office, he teamed up to form the APC, which cruised to power in the historic 2015 elections which saw Muhammadu Buhari defeating the then-incumbent President, Goodluck Jonathan of the PDP.Mr Buhari tapped Mr Amaechi to be his transportation minister, a position he held until 2022 when he resigned to participate in the APC presidential primaries, which he lost to Mr Tinubu.From 2015 till date, the APC under his firm control has been playing second-fiddle to the ruling PDP in Rivers State. The APC failed to fly in 2019 and was also rolled over by the PDP in the 2023 general elections.His preferred candidate, Tonye Cole, the governorship candidate of the APC, came a distant second to the winner of the election, Sim Fubara, the candidate of the PDP, backed by the outgoing governor of the state, Nyesom Wike.Mr Amaechi, who was the DG of the Buhari campaign in 2015 and 2019 respectively, however, glaringly stayed away from the presidential campaign of the APC in 2023 and has also made utterances that could be taken as a shot fired at Mr Tinubu.He has no immediate political future either at home or at the national level as it does not appear he will have a role to play in the Tinubu presidency. His followers back in Rivers may also begin to find new alignments or nests to pursue their political ambitions.The APC may also begin to find a new rallying figure for its faithful in the oil-rich state as Mr Amaechi does not seem to have the necessary gravitas to make the party a winning platform in the state.Credit must be given to Sule Lamido in a way because he has remained consistent with the PDP since its inception, even when it was tempting to jump ship, especially in 2014.However, there does not seem to be much left for him to mine politically again as he failed on 18 March to install his son as the governor of Jigawa State, a state he ruled for two terms as governor.
His son, Mustapha Lamido, lost to the candidate of the ruling APC in the governorship election in the state. The older Lamido will also not find any refuge at the national level after Atiku lost the presidential election.He may just have to resign to being an ‘elder statesman’ even as his time in the political limelight begins to dim.Although he made a last-minute face-saving effort to campaign for the reelection of Babajide Sanwo-Olu as Lagos State governor, Rauf Aregbesola, interior minister, will find it difficult to regain his pride of place in the inner caucus of the president-elect, Bola Tinubu, his estranged political mentor and leader.Mr Aregbesola, a former two-term governor of Osun State, was a strong ally of Mr Tinubu for years until their relationship went south because of former Governor Gboyega Oyetola, a nephew of the president-elect.The interior minister did not campaign for Mr Tinubu during the electioneering and was even in Saudi Arabia to perform a lesser hajj when the presidential election was held.Although efforts have been made to reconcile the erstwhile political jolly good fellows, it does not appear their relationship will ever be the same again because so many waters have passed under the bridge between them. Anyway, in political relationships, never say never.In Osun, the APC is polarised between Mr Oyetola and Mr Aregbesola. In fact, the in-fighting between the two political gladiators, observers said, contributed significantly to the dislodgement of the party from power by the PDP.For now, Mr Oyetola is the leader of the dominant faction of the party in Osun even as he is in court to retrieve his mandate which he claimed was stolen by the PDP. It is believed the president-elect will relate more with him than Mr Aregbesola when he is sworn in as president.In the same vein, party leaders in Lagos will also find it difficult to re-embrace Mr Aregbesola who was until recently considered the second-in-command to Mr Tinubu in the leadership hierarchy of the party in the state.The only way Atiku can make a quick political comeback is if he succeeds in his challenge of the victory of the president-elect, Mr Tinubu, in court.Anything short of that may end his political career spanning over three decades and his long quest to become Nigeria’s president completely eclipsed.
Other things being equal, by the time Mr Tinubu would have completed his tenure, Atiku may just be somewhere outside the country or within tending to his chain of businesses with politics no longer on the card for him.The outgoing Abia State governor faces a gloomy political future at the moment as far as the PDP is concerned. Will he port to the APC to at least find some respite? No one knows what his options are as of now.He lost his attempt to go to the Senate and also failed to install a successor as the state fell to the Labour Party in the 18th March election.He is one of the biggest losers in the G-5, a group of PDP governors who were against the presidential candidate of the party in the 25th February election. Samuel Ortom of Benue State shares a similar fate with him. That of the Enugu Governor, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, is a bit different. Although he lost his senatorial bid, he was able to retain the state for the PDP at the governorship level. The result is being contested by the Labour Party in any case.It will take a while before the PDP can recover in Abia State, given the way it was battered in the general elections. Unfortunately, Mr Ikpeazu has the ill luck of being the governor under whose watch the PDP slipped out of dominant control of the political leadership in the state.He will probably be having a multitude of ideas running riot in his mind on how best to move on from his colossal loss at the polls.The outgoing senator for Ogun Central District tried all he could, just as he did in 2019, to ensure Dapo Abiodun did not win the 2023 governorship election.Despite being in the APC as Mr Abiodun, Mr Amosun, a former two-term governor of the state, campaigned openly and vehemently against the governor seeking reelection.The former governor threw his weight behind the candidate of the ADC, Biyi Otegbeye, who hails from Ogun West, and who came third in the election.Although he supported and campaigned for Mr Tinubu who later emerged as the president-elect, he is not considered one of the major power brokers who will have the ears of the president post 29 May.He has been governor and senator and attempted to become president. What else will he consider doing now when the current political variables do not seem to be favourable to him? Hang up his boots and call it quits with politics? Only he will decide.",Temidayo Akinboyo ,29/03/2023,https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/590501-590501.html
#NigeriaDecides2023: How Nigerians voted in legislative elections  –  Report,"A civil society organisation, OrderPaper Advocacy Initiative (OAI), has said 63 per cent of voters that participated in the recent state assembly elections voted for candidates based on party affiliation and previous choices of presidential and governorship candidates.It also said 61.35 per cent of voters cast their ballot in the National Assembly elections based on party affiliation and choice of presidential candidates.This was contained in a report, titled “Consolidated Report on the 2023 State Assembly Elections,” released by the organisation on Sunday.The Independent National Election Commission (INEC) conducted the assembly and the governorship elections on 18 March. While the assembly elections were held in the 36 states of the federation, the governorship was conducted in 28 states.“An aggregated 63% of the respondents our trained observers spoke with, made their voting choice based on factors such as party affiliation (34.28%), previous choice of a presidential candidate (5.38%), governorship candidate (3.97%),” the report signed by the Executive Director of OAI, Oke Epia, said.The organisation also said while 81.59 per cent of sampled voters that participated in the election across the country had prior knowledge of the candidates, only 37.39 per cent of them voted for these candidates based on individual merits.On the National Assembly elections held earlier on 25 February, OAI said 61.35 per cent of voters cast their ballot based on party affiliation and choice of presidential candidates.“61.35% of voters made their voting choices at the Senate and House of Representatives elections based on party affiliation and choice of presidential candidates,” the report stated.The report also detailed cases of voter suppression and punctuality by electoral officials and vote buying.OAI said in terms of punctuality, there was an improvement during the governorship and houses of assembly elections.“In the area of punctuality on the part of polling officials and opening of polling units, there was a marked improvement from the National Assembly polls, where only 61.34% of the polling units opened on time.“84.29% of the polling units sampled opened on time in line with INEC’s guidelines for polls to open at 8:30 am. The average time of arrival and opening of polling units generally stood at 9:00 am in many parts of the country.“There were, however, large reports of low voter turnout resulting from voter intimidation by thugs, political party agents and voter apathy linked to the perceived mismatch of voting and results announced in the February 25 Presidential and National Assembly elections.“The issue of voter suppression was flagged, especially as thugs disrupted voting and deployed violent intimidation to prevent voters from coming to cast their vote in some areas in Lagos, Oyo, Nassarawa, and Imo, among others. Similarly, there were reported cases of vote trading by political party agents in states like Cross River, Adamawa, Ogun, Ondo and Imo. Particularly in Imo, there were some cases of systematic vote-buying.“It is our hope that this finding on the bandwagon effect will raise the much-needed awareness and sensitisation among stakeholders in the democratic project and attract more attention to the legislature before, during and after post-elections to facilitate improved service delivery by this most critical arm of government at the state level,” the report said.On the methodology used to gather its data, the organisation said it deployed observers in over 300 of the 993 state constituencies across the country during the state elections on 18 March. It said the observers collected the data by speaking with voters.OAI stated that it carefully recruited, empowered and deployed hundreds of active citizens from its citizen legislative accountability programme.
In addition, OAI said it set up a Situation Room for the State Assembly elections with the objective of observing a possible bandwagon trend in the legislative elections, as well as ascertaining compliance of the election management body- the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) – and other stakeholders with the electoral law and INEC guidelines.",Bakare Majeed ,28/03/2023,https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/more-news/590452-nigeriadecides2023-how-nigerians-voted-in-legislative-elections-report.html
2023 Elections: Nigeria police apprehend 781 suspected electoral offenders,"The Nigeria Police Force arrested a total of 781 alleged electoral offenders across the country during the just concluded elections.Nigeria held presidential and national assembly elections on 25 February while gubernatorial and state assembly elections were held on 18 March this year.The Inspector General of Police, Alkali Usman, made the disclosure Monday afternoon during a meeting with Assistant Inspectors-General of Police (AIGs), Commissioners of Police (CPs) and other Tactical Commanders in Abuja.The meeting, according to the force spokesperson, Olumuyiwa Adejobi, was to evaluate police performances during the elections.Mr Adejobi said Mr Usman has directed state commands to submit case files of the electoral offenders to the force Electoral Offences Desk at the police headquarters.Mr Adejobi said 145 infractions were reported during the presidential and national assembly election leading to the arrest of  203 suspects. He said the police arrested 578 offenders during the gubernatorial and state assembly elections from 304 infractions.He said the suspects would be prosecuted expeditiously and transparently.“He equally assured of effective collaboration with the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to expeditiously and transparently prosecute the 781 electoral offenders apprehended from a total of 489 major electoral infractions across the nation, as all Commands were tasked with submitting casefiles centrally at the Electoral Offences Desk, Office of the IGP, Force Headquarters, Abuja, for coordinated processing to INEC Legal Section,” he said.While commending the senior police officers, Mr Alkali called on them to rejig their strategies towards ensuring a stable post-election nation.“The IGP seized the opportunity to commend the Senior Police Officers and Commanders and other ranks for their resilience, sacrifices, and professionalism which ensured the containment of the pockets of election security breaches across the country during the electioneering process and enhanced the overall credibility of the elections in line with the police reform initiatives of President Muhammadu Buhari. “The Inspector-General of Police, therefore, charged the Strategic Police Managers to readjust strategies and operations towards ensuring a stable post-election security order and refocus policing attention on routine law enforcement duties. “He similarly, and firmly, admonished all political actors and their supporters to submit to democratic norms, peaceful means, and legal procedures in advancing their interests as the Police and other security agencies shall not tolerate the resort to incitement or any act designed to threaten our national security,” Mr Adejobi said in the statement.",Mohammed Babangida ,27/03/2023,https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/top-news/590358-2023-elections-nigeria-police-apprehend-781-suspected-electoral-offenders.html
APGA candidate rejects Enugu governorship election results,"The governorship candidate of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) in Enugu State, Frank Nweke Jr, has rejected the 18 March governorship election results in the state declared by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).Mr Nweke Jr, a former Nigeria’s minister of information, disclosed this during a press conference on Friday.The APGA candidate posted the text of the press conference on his verified Twitter handle.PREMIUM TIMES reported that the governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the state, Peter Mbah, was declared winner of the election on Wednesday night.Mr Mbah polled 160,895 votes to defeat his closest challenger, Chijioke Edeoga of the Labour Party (LP) who scored 157,552 votes.Mr Nweke Jr garnered 17,983 votes to come third, while the candidate of the All Progressives Congress, Uche Nnaji, placed fourth, with 14,575 votes.The former minister said the election was not free and fair and that there were cases of threats and intimidation of voters in the state.He also claimed that town criers had, in the morning of the Election Day, travelled through several communities in the state “ordering” anyone who would not vote for the PDP to “stay home.”“At various polling units across the State, PDP thugs, party members, hired criminals and some compromised members of the police and military threatened voters at polling units and chased those who could not be bought over or intimidated into voting for the PDP,” Mr Nweke Jr said.He also claimed that the most vulnerable and impoverished became prey to vote buying by the PDP and LP, adding that the PDP further secured the assistance of the INEC agents to rig the election by offering cash or issuing threats as the situation demanded.“Only a few polling unit agents uploaded their results directly on IREV as provided by INEC, and fake result sheets were used to rewrite and manipulate the results of vote counts at the polling units before the falsified results of the elections were uploaded to the IREV. Some of these result sheets are also completely blurred on the portal,” he stated.The APGA candidate claimed the collation of results at various local government headquarters were “hijacked” by thugs and agents of the PDP and that gunshots were fired sporadically at Nkanu West Collation Centre in Agbani.PREMIUM TIMES reported that the collation of results from Nsukka and Nkanu East – two local government areas which were earlier suspended on Monday by the INEC irregularities – were completed before the declaration of the winner.The LP agent, Eugene Edeoga, had alleged, in a petition to the commission, that the Bimodal Voter Registration System (BVAS) machine was not used during the election in the Nkanu East Council Area and that there was a case of overvoting.His PDP counterpart, Festus Uzo, made a similar allegation against results from Nsukka Council Area.However, INEC overruled his petition during a review of the results, but sustained the allegation by Mr Edeoga, the LP agent, according to Maduebibisi Iwe, the returning officer for the election.Mr Iwe, a professor and the vice-chancellor of the University of Agriculture Umudike, said although the commission established that the BVAS machines were used during the election in Nkanu East Council Area, it discovered that there were cases of over voting in the area.
The commission, he said, consequently reduced the result from 30,350 votes earlier given to the PDP candidate to 16,956 votes, after its review of the results from the council area.It also increased the LP candidate’s initial score of 1855 votes in the council area to 1864 votes.But Mr Nweke Jr, the APGA candidate, said the entire process – up to the declaration of the winner – was “a complete farce” and lacks legitimacy.“The results of Nkanu East Local Government Area, which were contested, got reviewed and revised by the national office of INEC without any basis given for the change in numbers. If it was a case of over-voting, the expectation is that the result from the local government area should have been cancelled.“It does seem that the numbers were simply manufactured to fit a preprogrammed outcome and read out to the public, as can be inferred from the Returning Officer of INEC in the state, Prof Maduebibisi Ofo Iwe’s comments about acting under authority and reading out what he had been given,” he stated.Mr Nweke Jr vowed to continue engaging the system no matter how long it takes until he recovers his mandate.“We will explore and exhaust every action required to ensure the legitimacy of the next government in Enugu State,” he stated.",Chinagorom Ugwu ,25/03/2023,https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/more-news/590074-apga-candidate-rejects-enugu-governorship-election-results.html
"Appeal Court dismisses PDP’s suit against Tinubu, Shettima over alleged double nomination","The Court of Appeal, Abuja, Friday evening, dismissed an appeal by Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), seeking the disqualification of Bola Tinubu, the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), and his deputy, Kassim Shettima, in the 25 February election.A three-member panel headed by Justice James Abundaga, in a unanimous judgment, held that the PDP failed to establish that it had a legal basis (locus standi) to institute the case.The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the PDP, in an appeal marked: CA/ABJ/CV/108/2023, had asked the appellate court to reverse the 13 January judgment delivered by Justice Inyang Ekwo of a Federal High Court, Abuja which dismissed its suit on the grounds that the PDP lacked the legal basis to have instituted the suit.While the PDP was the appellant, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), APC, Messrs Tinubu and Shettima were respondents in the appeal.The PDP had, in the suit filed on 28 July 2022, challenged the validity of the Tinubu/Shettima ticket for the 2023 presidential election.It argued that Mr Shettima’s nomination as the running mate was in breach of the provisions of Sections 29(1), 33, 35 and 84{1)}(2)} of the Electoral Act, 2022 (as amended), claiming that Mr Shettima had double nominations.It claimed that as of the time Mr Shettima was nominated as a vice presidential candidate, he had not resigned nor withdrawn his nomination as candidate for the Borno Central senatorial poll.The party argued that Mr Shettima’s nomination as a vice-presidential candidate, as well as the candidate for the Borno Central Senatorial seat, contravened the law.The PDP, which sought an order disqualifying the APC, Mr Tinubu and Mr Shettima from contesting the presidential election scheduled for 25 February equally asked the court for an order nullifying their candidacy.It further asked the court for an order compelling INEC to remove their names from its list of nominated or sponsored candidates eligible to contest the election.The defendants, in their preliminary objection, urged the court to dismiss the suit for want of jurisdiction.They contended that the plaintiff lacked the legal basis to institute the case, which invariably challenged APC’s decision and its nomination of candidates for the election, which were within the confines of the party’s internal affairs and thus, non-justiciable.Delivering the lead judgment, Justice Abundaga, who agreed with the submissions of lawyers to the respondents, including Thomas Ojo of Lateef Fagbemi and Co, described the PDP as a busy body, who dabbled into issues that were internal affairs of the APC.Justice Abundaga held that the trial court was right to have held that the PDP failed to establish its legal basis.“The appellant, having failed to disclose its locus standi, this appeal fails and it is hereby dismissed,” he said and proceeded to affirm the judgment of the high court.The judge also awarded N5 million cost against the appellant’s lawyer, J. O. Olotu.(NAN)

Alleged Suspension Plan: Court fixes date for judgement on Rivers governor-elect’s suit,"The Federal High Court (FHC), Abuja, on Friday, fixed 20 April for judgement on a suit filed by the Rivers State governor-elect, Siminlalayi Fubara, and his deputy, Ngozi Odu, to stop an alleged plan by their party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), to suspend them.The judge, Inyang Ekwo, fixed the judgment day after Mr Fubara’s counsel, Joshua Musa, and Johnson Usman, who represented the PDP and its executives, adopted their processes and presented their arguments for and against the suit.Mr Ekwo similarly fixed 20 April for judgment in a suit filed by the Cross River PDP governorship candidate, Sandy Onor, and his running mate, Ambrose Emana, against the party and its executives over their alleged planned suspension from the party.In a related development, the judge fixed the same date for a ruling on a motion moved by Mr Musa, seeking an order to amend their suit in another suit filed by the Rivers PDP Chairman, Desmond Akawo, against the party, its National Chairman, Iyorchia Ayu, and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) which was opposed by Mr Usman.At the resumed hearing on Friday, Mr Usman informed the court that the PDP wrote a letter to the Chief Judge (CJ) of FHC, John Tsoho, asking that the case be reassigned to another judge.The senior lawyer said Mr Ekwo was copied in the letter.He said the letter dated 14 March was received by the Chief Judge on 15 March.NAN reports that the PDP letter urged the chief judge to transfer all three cases currently before Mr Ekwo to other judges.The party cited loss of confidence and bias as grounds for the application.But Mr Musa opposed the application, saying he was unaware of such a letter.He argued that such an administrative letter cannot serve as a stay of proceeding since no response had been received from the CJ regarding the letter.The judge, who said he had not seen the letter, said he got to know about the development through social media.Mr Ekwo, however, directed the parties to proceed in the matter since he has not received any communication in that regard.And after the counsel adopted their processes, the judge adjourned the first two cases for judgment and fixed Mr Akawo’s suit for ruling.The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Messrs Fubara, Onor, Akawo and others had filed three separate suits against the PDP and others.In the suit marked: FHC/ABJ/CS/123/2023, which was filed by Messrs Fubara, Odu, and 48 others, the plaintiffs listed PDP, its National Working Committee (NWC) and National Executive Committee (NEC) as 1st to 3rd respondents respectively.Also joined in the suit are the PDP National Chairman, Iyorchia Ayu; National Secretary, Samuel Anyanwu and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) as 4th to 6th respondents respectively.
The 50 plaintiffs sought an order of injunction restraining the 1st to 5th defendants from suspending, expelling or in any manner doing any act that would tamper with their fundamental rights.They said these rights were guaranteed under Section 40 of the 1999 Constitution (as amended) and Articles 10 and 13 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights (Ratification and Enforcement) Act, CAP. AQ, Laws of the Federation, 2004.They also sought an order of injunction restraining INEC from according any recognition to any suspension or expulsion or any other act(s) of the 1st to 5th respondents designed to violate their fundamental rights.They prayed the court to declare that the threat to suspend, expel or tamper with their rights as members of PDP and its candidates at the general elections on account of the disagreement between the party’s national executives and Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State where they hail from amounted to a denial of their rights.Also in their originating motion marked: FHC/ABJ/CS/215/2023, Messrs Onor and Emana sued the PDP and the five respondents.They equally sought the same prayers as Mr Fubara and his deputy-elect.They urged the court to declare that the threat to suspend, expel or tamper with their rights as members of the party and its candidates in the March 18 general elections on account of the disagreement between the party’s executives and Governor Wike who was perceived to have a relationship with them amounted to a denial of their rights.The PDP and its executives, in a notice of preliminary objection filed by their lawyer, Mr Usman, urged the court to dismiss the two suits for being incurably defective and fatally incompetent.Giving five grounds, Mr Usman argued that the suits were incurably incompetent and ought to be struck out, in that the suit was not justiciable.The senior lawyer said the suits constituted an abuse of the court process as the matter dealt with the internal and domestic matters of a political party.He said the court lacked the jurisdiction to entertain, hear and determine the matter being an intra-party matter dealing with the membership of a political party.
Mr Usman argued that the 3rd and 4th respondents (the NEC and Ayu) were non-juristic persons.(NAN)",Agency Report ,25/03/2023,https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/top-news/590015-alleged-suspension-plan-court-fixes-date-for-judgement-on-rivers-governor-elects-suit.html
