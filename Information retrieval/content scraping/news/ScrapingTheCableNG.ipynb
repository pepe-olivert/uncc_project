The post claims that over time, salt accumulates in the kidney and requires cleaning treatment. As a cleansing measure, the post advised social media users to boil scent leaves, and drink the filtered tea. “Drink one cup a day and you will see that all the salt and poison accumulated in your kidneys begin to appear when you urinate. This is recognized as the best cleansing treatment for the kidneys and it’s natural,” the post explains. The scientific name of the scent leaf is Ocimum gratissimum. Its other English names are wild basil or tree basil. It is popularly called Ewe Efinrin in Yoruba, Nchuanwu in Igbo, and Daidoya in Hausa. As posted on WhatsApp, the message advised readers to send the post to friends and well-wishers. The kidney is among the vital organs in the body. It is a bean-shaped organ on both sides of the spine, below the ribs. The role of the kidney is to filter blood, remove waste and control the body’s fluid balance. Verification TheCable spoke with medical experts to confirm if there is scientific evidence to support the use of scent leaves in cleaning the kidney. Theophilus Umeizudike, a nephrologist at the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital said, “there is no scientific evidence to show that scent leaves can be used to clean the kidney”. He further encouraged Nigerians to be wary of the information on social media, particularly if it is not from a certified medical institution. “When people read things online, they should ensure it is from a reputable institution, to ensure that the claim is supported by adequate scientific research and found to be beneficial to help treat an ailment,” he added.\n",

This is recognized as the best cleansing treatment for the kidneys and it’s natural,” the post explains. The scientific name of the scent leaf is Ocimum gratissimum. Its other English names are wild basil or tree basil. It is popularly called Ewe Efinrin in Yoruba, Nchuanwu in Igbo, and Daidoya in Hausa. As posted on WhatsApp, the message advised readers to send the post to friends and well-wishers. The kidney is among the vital organs in the body. It is a bean-shaped organ on both sides of the spine, below the ribs. The role of the kidney is to filter blood, remove waste and control the body’s fluid balance. Verification TheCable spoke with medical experts to confirm if there is scientific evidence to support the use of scent leaves in cleaning the kidney. Theophilus Umeizudike, a nephrologist at the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital said, “there is no scientific evidence to show that scent leaves can be used to clean the kidney”. He further encouraged Nigerians to be wary of the information on social media, particularly if it is not from a certified medical institution. “When people read things online, they should ensure it is from a reputable institution, to ensure that the claim is supported by adequate scientific research and found to be beneficial to help treat an ailment,” he added.\n",

      "Over the weekend, a picture showing a man robed in a cassock mostly used by Catholic priests while holding a gun was circulated on social media. Social media users, who posted the picture, claimed it was a cleric in Sokoto state who carried a gun to church, on Sunday, to protect himself from protesters.ATP Hausa TV, a Facebook page with about 11,000 followers, posted the picture of the cleric on Sunday and it has so far garnered over 170 comments and 1,000 shares.The caption, which was translated into English language, reads, “A pastor went to church with a gun to protect himself from protesters in Sokoto state. Between Muslims and followers of Christianity, who are the terrorists? Help us share this post so that the Nigerian government will know who are peaceful people and who are terrorists.” The posts have been archived hereand here.On Sunday, another Facebook user, Muhammad Lawan Bulama, also shared the image with the caption, “Pastor holding AK47 in Sokoto. The question is: where did he get this gun from? Is it allowed for a civilian to hold AK47? Is he a terrorist?BACKGROUND On Saturday, some residents staged a protest to call for the release of suspects arrested in connection with the murder of Deborah Samuel, a female student of Shehu Shagari College of Education, Sokoto state.Deborah was attacked by a mob, on Thursday, and set ablaze over “blasphemous comments”. The incident sparked outrage and condemnation across the country.The protest had fuelled the spread of fake news on the incident. TheCable had previously fact-checked some claims hereand here. IS THIS PICTURE FROM SOKOTO? Using fotoforensics, a digital image platform, to verify whether the image has been altered, TheCable observedthat the image has not been digitally modified.However, the image was subjected to a reverse image search on multiple search engines and it was discovered that the picture has been on the internet since January 2017.The Punch, in a report published on January 29, 2017, said the picture was posted on Facebook by a Nigerian identified as Achike Onwuazo.The newspaper said Onwuazo had captioned the picture with “Carry go, my blessed Rev. Father. He who is surrounded by his enemies is always alert.”Some websites also published the picture in January 2017. It can be found here, hereand here.When TheCable searched the Facebook profile of Achike Onwuazo, it was discovered that the picture is no longer available on the user’s wall.Some social media users had said the picture is that of a cleric from the northern region of Nigeria.TheCable could not independently verify the person in the picture and the exact location where it was taken.VERDICT Since the picture was posted on the internet in 2017, it is misleading to attribute the picture to an incident in Sokoto in 2022. Therefore, the picture attributed to a cleric carrying a gun in Sokoto to resist protesters is false.Source: Fact Check\n",

The fashion enthusiast was 25 years old at the time she was featured on the show. Before her stint on the show, the Enugu-born actress had graduated with a law degree from Madonna University in Anambra in 2014. VERIFICATION   First of all, there are inconsistencies with the age of both parties as speculated by the blogs and social media posts.   Cee-C was 29 years old as of the time the picture emerged online.   According to publicly available information, Obasanjo was born in 1937 at Ibogun-Olaogun, Ogun state.    As of 2021, Obasanjo was 84 years old and not 86 as claimed by the blog posts.   The former head of state had married a few times. His ex-wives are Mojisola Adekunle, Stella Abebe, Lynda, and Esther Oluremi. He currently lives in Ogun state with Bola Obasanjo, whom he married in 2009. Now to the origin of the photograph: Cee-C posted the picture on December 13, 2021, saying she had a business meeting with the former president. Corroborating this, Linus Okorie, Nigerian leadership consultant and author, also posted a picture of himself, Nwadiora and the former president, on the same day.   In a now-deleted post, Okorie said the meeting was a preparation for the launch of Guardians of the Nation International (GOTNI ), a nonprofit leadership development organisation. “Had a great meeting today with this great Nigerian. Chief Olusegun Obasanjo our highly respected former president of Nigeria ” he wrote.   “CeeCee a brilliant lawyer and celebrity was a part of the visiting team.

According to the definition,  masturbation can be achieved by manual or other bodily contacts exclusive of sexual intercourse, by instrumental manipulation, occasionally by sexual fantasies, or by various combinations of these agencies.    The Cable reached out to medical experts to confirm if there is any scientific evidence to back up the claim that masturbation or indiscriminate ejaculation might lead to hair loss.    Best Ordinioha, a professor of public health and community medicine, dismissed the claim, stating that there is no correlation between receding hairline and masturbation.    According to him, the Twitter user probably put out such a post to attract traffic to his page.   “I think he’s just doing scaremongering and this could also lead to stigma to men who are going bald, when people see them, they think that’s what they do,” the professor of medicine said.   “In health sciences, increased testosterone level is responsible for receding hairline, testosterone is the male hormone. However, there is no scientific evidence to back the claim that indiscriminate ejaculation causes baldness.   “Those with higher testosterone levels may have higher sexual drives but this can be modulated and decreased by a lot of factors: stress can make someone impotent, and sex will probably be the last thing on their minds. I think the poster overstretched it.”    POSSIBLE CAUSES OF HAIR LOSS   Francis Agbaraolorunpo, a medical expert at the University of Lagos, said a couple of factors which include, genetics, medical conditions and excessive usage of chemicals can be responsible for hair loss in men, but definitely not masturbation.    “One of the fundamental causes of baldness is genetics, a person is born with the tendency. The other thing is that a person can inherit it from parents,” he said.    “Some persons who have alopecia or debilitating medical conditions such as cancer can also lose their hair. In such situations, a  female can as well experience hair loss.   “If you see a man with a receding hairline, most likely, there is that gene in the family line, it could have been an unexpressed gene, but the person could express it when the gene aligns with certain environmental conditions.”   However, the medical expert emphasised that masturbation is more of a psychological issue and has nothing to do with hair loss or the physical appearance of a man.    He further disclosed that inferiority complex might also be one of the causes of masturbation in men, adding that “it could lead to infertility issues”.   “A man who masturbates and loses sperm frequently might suffer low sperm count when meeting with a woman.”'"

Speaking at the meeting, Asefon claimed the minister publicly celebrated his son who graduated from a university abroad while being dispassionate about the incessant strike in Nigerian institutions. “This is your second term in office, your salary will be paid. The salaries of the lecturers will be paid. We want to really know what is really happening,” the student leader said. “Honourable minister, you celebrated your son who graduated in a country, in a university outside this country.

Weshould enjoy what we are paying for.“We want adequate funding of education in this country, honourable minister, our message is that we want to go back to class.

Thank you.” Then, the minister stood up and walked out of the meeting.

The post claims that over time, salt accumulates in the kidney and requires cleaning treatment. As a cleansing measure, the post advised social media users to boil scent leaves, and drink the filtered tea. “Drink one cup a day and you will see that all the salt and poison accumulated in your kidneys begin to appear when you urinate. This is recognized as the best cleansing treatment for the kidneys and it’s natural,” the post explains. The scientific name of the scent leaf is Ocimum gratissimum. Its other English names are wild basil or tree basil. It is popularly called Ewe Efinrin in Yoruba, Nchuanwu in Igbo, and Daidoya in Hausa. As posted on WhatsApp, the message advised readers to send the post to friends and well-wishers. The kidney is among the vital organs in the body. It is a bean-shaped organ on both sides of the spine, below the ribs. The role of the kidney is to filter blood, remove waste and control the body’s fluid balance.'\n",

Theophilus Umeizudike, a nephrologist at the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital said, “there is no scientific evidence to show that scent leaves can be used to clean the kidney”. He further encouraged Nigerians to be wary of the information on social media, particularly if it is not from a certified medical institution. “When people read things online, they should ensure it is from a reputable institution, to ensure that the claim is supported by adequate scientific research and found to be beneficial to help treat an ailment,” he added. TheCable also contacted Awofeso Opeyemi, a research fellow at the Harvard Medical School and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Massachusetts, USA.   She said there is no evidence in medical science that scent leaves can be used to clean the kidney.     “Kidney health doesn’t require so much,” she said, adding that “nature has made it such that taking adequate water every day (ideally, 3 Litres or 12 cups for an adult), can significantly reduce the risk of kidney disease. A clean glass of water will just do, you do not need to add anything to it”.   According to Awofeso, kidney health should include reduced salt intake, drinking lots of water, and early treatment of hypertension.   According to her,  untreated hypertension could lead to kidney failure.   “Hypertension once diagnosed is often life-long and with a few tablets taken daily, as prescribed by a medical doctor, the risk of kidney damage which might require a kidney transplant can be reduced,” she said.   “This is because hypertension usually does not give symptoms until vital organs like the kidney are damaged. Oftentimes, people go to doctors in their 20s or 30s, they are told they have hypertension and given medications, many only take them for a few days and stop. Unfortunately, it appears there is no problem until later in life.”'"

We further searched his verified Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram accounts and could not find any notification of his defection from the All progressives Congress (APC) to the Labour Party (LP).   Such a political move would have been reported by credible media platforms, but none of them reported it.   TheCable reached out to Ambode’s executive assistant, and Julius Abure, the national chairman of the Labour Party, but they are yet to respond to calls and messages. We will update this report if they do.   Premium Times spoke with Ifagbemi Awamaridi, Lagos state chairman of the Labour Party. He refuted claims that the former governor of Lagos has joined LP.   “Ambode is still with the ruling All Progressive Congress (APC) party. He’s a bona fide and committed APC member who will work for the success of the party’s candidate at the state and federal levels,” he said.'"

The chapter, titled “Atiku and US Justice Entanglement”, detailed some “corrupt involvement” of the former vice president with a company called iGATE and William Jefferson, a former US lawmaker, who was later jailed for 13 years.   Although, in the chapter, Obasanjo linked Atiku to the embezzlement of $20 million, which the administration was supposed to deploy for Petroleum Technology Development Fund (PTDF), and another $125 million to fund PTDF during 2003 the fiscal year.   Also, page 31 of book 1 falls under chapter 3, which is titled “The Family”, wherein Obasanjo detailed his childhood and his experience with his family. He didn’t make mention of Atiku.   Page 31 of book 2 falls in a chapter titled “Political Consultations and Conventions”. In this page, the former president recorded how he battled with the decision of whom to pick as the vice-president. He mentioned Atiku, but he didn’t state any issue related to money.   Page 31 of book 3 falls under a chapter tagged “Critical Assessment of Yar’ Adua Administration”. Checks through the pages and chapters of the book revealed nothing of such viral statement.'"

Also, no other credible news medium in the country reported the statement aside Daily Times.    However,  in a keynote address he delivered in 2016, Obasanjo described “Biafra secession issue” as dead, and advised that no Nigerian should give vent to the agitation.   When contacted by TheCable, Kehinde Akinyemi, Obasanjo’s spokesman, dismissed the claim, saying the former president would not utter such statement.   He described the post as a way to garner “unconscionable followership and accrue funds by the news media,” he said.    “It’s fake. Baba won’t even comment on such issue.”'"
