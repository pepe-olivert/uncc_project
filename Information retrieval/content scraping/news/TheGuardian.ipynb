      "Title:  Nigerians have right to choose their leaders, says Boris Johnson\n",
      "Author:  By Muyiwa Adeyemi (Politics  Editor), Azimazi Momoh Jimoh, Abuja, Ann Godwin, Port Harcourt, Samson Kukwa-Yanor, Makurdi\n",
      "Date:  ['28 March 2023']\n",
      "Article:  • Tasks politicians on helping citizens unleash their potential\n",
      "• Court restrains Ayu from parading self as PDP national chairman\n",
      "• Only PDP NEC can suspend me, Ayu boasts\n",
      "• Wike mocks Ayu, says fight against him just started \n",
      "Former Prime Minister of Britain, Boris Johnson, yesterday, said Nigerians should have the right to choose their leaders saying that development can only thrive in a democracy.\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He also charged Nigerian politicians to ensure that millions of Nigerians realise their potential, identifying education and equal rights as part of the major conditions for unleashing potentials of citizens.\n",
      "Johnson spoke in Lagos as a keynote speaker at the 16th session of the Osigwe Anyiam-Osigwe yearly lecture series, with the theme: “Rehumanising Human Experience: A Synopsis of Anyiam-Osigwe’s Treatises.”\n",
      "He noted that while millions of Nigerians are yet to reach their full potential, it behoves politicians to create conducive environment in which people can unleash their potential, “because not only that it is morally right, it is surely right if we care about human development and to give everyone the chance to express their potential.”\n",
      "The British parliamentarian said citizens would unleash their potentials if they were treated equally before the law, noting that equality before the law made Britain what it is today.\n",
      "He said: “First and most importantly, you got to have equality under the law because that is the foundation of freedom. Whoever you are, rich or poor, you will receive the same scrutiny, same protection in Britain.\n",
      "“The next great freedom is the right to choose those who govern you and the right to remove them from office. It is called democracy,” he added.\n",
      "He called for an open society where diversity can be tolerated, explaining that such made London a hub of talents.\n",
      "Johnson, who made a case for a stronger mutually beneficial relationship between Nigeria and Britain, said it would further help both countries to unleash their potentials.\n",
      "He said: “Now is the time. When the world is so uncertain, when some nations are disentangling, now is the time for Britain and Nigeria, two great democracies to work together. Nigeria can be a renewable superpower and still be a producer of oil and gas. We could be much more together.”\n",
      "Other areas for continued collaborations, according to him, include free trade, free speech and free elections.\n",
      "“You need a society that is open and that is tolerant to develop human potentials,” he said, adding that, “urban successes are built on freedom under the law.”\n",
      "Johnson said what London is to Britain is what Lagos is to Africa. He, however, urged Lagos State Government to improve its transportation system, noting that spending long hours in traffic can be very frustrating.\n",
      "He advised the state government to understudy mass transit programme of Britain and not to go to “China or Russia.”\n",
      "According to him, Lagos, London and Los Angeles are the three states leading in creative industry. He paid tribute to the late Chief Executive Officer of the Africa Movie Academy Award (AMAA), Peace Maria Anyiam-Osigwe, for her efforts in developing creative industry in Africa.\n",
      "Welcoming dignitaries to the event, Charles Anyiam-Osigwe said the lecture “is an adventure within the bounds of the submission of Emmanuel Anyiam-Osigwe on how we can vastly realise a better world order. It is in this construct that he variously espouses on man as the primary moving force of sentient existence. In his fragments, he avers that ‘man is the centre of the universe’. It is in this context that he evaluates the primacy of man as the driving wheel of sentient existence and its social order.\n",
      "“The existence of poverty and the social disequilibrium that characterises the present world order is that man has lost contact with the attributes and definitions that qualify him as a human person. In the disconnection of his mental identity from his esoteric being, the human person loses the insight, which comes with his intuitive prowess beyond the mundane.”\n",
      "Some of the dignitaries at the event include, President-elect, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, who was represented by former deputy governor of Lagos State, Otunba Femi Pedro, Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State, represented by his deputy, Obafemi Hamzat, former Secretary-General of the Commonwealth, Chief Emeka Anyaoku and the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), Peter Obi.\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Pedro said Tinubu is already preparing himself to take Nigeria to greater heights. He urged participants and dignitaries that graced the event to be rest assured that Nigeria is in great hands. “Nigeria is on a great journey, Tinubu is the pilot,” Pedro said.\n",
      "Anyaoku spoke glowingly about the achievements of Mr. Johnson, especially in making the welfare of the people a priority.\n",
      "He said Mr. Johnson is a remarkable British politician and leader.\n",
      "“He has so far left legacies in modern British politics. He was the Prime Minister, who followed the decision of the majority of the British people…it was he, therefore (in popular parlance) who got Brexit done.\n",
      "“I believe if we were to effectively pursue the theme of this lecture, comprehensive welfare of the people should be the bedrock of policies and actions of politicians and actions across the world,” he stated.\n",
      "He enjoined Nigerians to be patriotic and avoid demeaning or de-marketing the country.\n",
      "Meanwhile, the crisis rocking the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) got worsened as a High Court, sitting in Makurdi, Benue State, yesterday, restrained Dr. Iyorchia Ayu from parading himself as the national chairman of the party.\n",
      "This followed an ex-parte application filed by a chieftain of the PDP, Comrade Terhide Utaan, who sought an interim injunction restraining Ayu from further parading himself as the national chairman of the party.\n",
      "In suit number MHC/85/ 2023 and motion number MHC/633M/2023 between Comrade Utaan and Senator Iyorchia Ayu and the PDP as respondents, before Justice W. I. Kpochi, the plaintiff sought for an order of interim injunction, restraining the 1st defendant, Dr. Ayu from further parading himself as the national chairman of the PDP, having lost membership of the party, pending the hearing and determination of motion on notice already filed.\n",
      "The application was supported by a 15-paragraph affidavit, which annexed three exhibits as A1, A2 and B.\n",
      "The exhibits are the applicant’s membership cards of the 2nd defendants (PDP), receipts for payment of dues and the vote of no confidence passed on the first defendants (Ayu) by his Igyorov council ward in Gboko local government.\n",
      "Justice Kpochi adjourned the case to April 14, 2023 for further hearing.\n",
      "The court order followed Ayu’s suspension by his ward at the weekend for allegedly engaging in anti-party activities.\n",
      "However, Ayu described his suspension as a nullity, just as he argued that only the National Executive Committee (NEC) could carry out such action.\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Ayu claimed that some members of the executive committee of his ward’s chapter of the party were teleguided by those he called political gamblers in Makurdi to cause mischief.\n",
      "In a statement released by his Special Adviser on Media and Communications, Simon Imobo-Tswam, he said: “Article 57(7) of the PDP Constitution as amended in 2017 expressly prohibits any organ of the party or executive committee of the party at the Ward or State level from taking any disciplinary measure against any member of the party’s National Executive Committee.”\n",
      "A resolution passed at the end of the meeting of executives of the party at the Ward level and read by its Secretary of Igyorov, Mr. Banger Dooyum, reads: “The PDP Executive Committee of Igyorov council ward of Gboko local government area in Benue state has passed a vote of no confidence on the PDP National Chairman, Dr. Iyorchia Ayu, and suspended him from the party.”\n",
      "Mr. Dooyum, while reading the resolution of the ward Exco, said: “He (Ayu) was involved in anti-party activities, making the PDP to lose at his ward and local government along with his allies, who also didn’t vote at the governorship election.”\n",
      "Ayu was also accused of not paying his yearly dues as enshrined by the party’s constitution.\n",
      "Worried by the development, a member of the Board of Trustees of the party, Chief Olabode George, called for calm and pleaded with the warring factions not to do anything that will exterminate the party.\n",
      "According to him, Ayu made mistakes for not abiding by his promise of stepping down if a northerner emerged as the presidential candidate of the party, and so, caused the party to lose presidential election.\n",
      "He, however, warned party members to use post election period for reconciliation and not to finally kill the party.\n",
      "He said it is only the NEC that can suspend or punish Ayu or any national leader of the party, urging members in Ayu’s ward to follow due process.\n",
      "Reacting to the development, Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, said the fight against Ayu, has just started.\n",
      "The governor stated that it has now become unthinkable to allow any person, who was unable to deliver his political unit, ward, council or state for the PDP during the last general elections, to preside over the party.\n",
      "Wike stated this yesterday, during the inauguration of the remodeled Community Secondary School in Okoro-nu-Odo, in Obio-Akpor Council of the state.\n",
      "The governor said it would be morally offensive for Ayu to remain as the national chairman of the PDP after the catastrophic defeat of the party under his watch in his unit, ward, local government, state and national level.\n",
      "According to him, the suspension of Ayu is the beginning of the fight to save the party.\n"

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Angry voters objected to the delay tactics of the electoral body in releasing the results and the alleged discrepancies in the election results signed by party agents against what was uploaded at INEC portal.\n",
      "As post-election crisis was gathering momentum, the European Union Election Observation Mission to Nigeria’s 2023 general elections declared, that owing to lack of transparency and operational failures, Nigerians have lost confidence and trust in INEC.\t\n",
      "Speaking at a media briefing in Abuja, yesterday, to present the Mission’s second preliminary reports, the Chief Observer, Barry Andrews, noted that although Nigerians had great appetite for democracy and were keen to engage in various civic activities, their expectations were dashed. According to him, the apathy recorded at the governorship and states House of Assembly elections conducted last Saturday was a clear consequence of failures by political elites and “unfortunately, INEC.”\t\n",
      "Andrews said: “Obstruction and organised violence limited the free expression of the will of the voters, despite efforts by civil society to promote democratic standards.\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Throughout the Mission, we saw that Nigerians have a great appetite for democracy and are keen to engage in various civic activities. However, in many parts of the country, their expectations were not met. Many were disappointed and we witnessed voter apathy that is in part, a clear consequence of failures by political elites, and unfortunately, also by INEC.\n",
      "“Positively, INEC introduced some corrective measures ahead of Saturday’s polls, allowing a timely delivery of sensitive materials and improved use of election technologies, yet, the institution continued to lack transparency.”\t\n",
      "The Mission also observed that voting started early with INEC ad-hoc officials present and ready to serve voters, but the exercise was unfortunately, disrupted by “multiple incidents of thuggery and intimidation of voters, polling officials, observers, and journalists.”\n",
      "The Mission noted that Lagos, Kano, and other States in the Southern, Northern and Central parts of the country were mostly affected, adding that the election was equally characterised by casualties, fatalities, as well as vote-buying, which according to the observers, further detracted from an appropriate conduct of elections.\n",
      "“EU EOM observers also saw misuse of administrative resources, including through various financial and in-kind inducements to voters, giving an undue advantage to the party in power. Furthermore, the protracted deadlines for candidacy disputes created uncertainty for voters and electoral contestants alike, while clear underrepresentation of women as candidates demonstrated a stark lack of internal party policies to support constitutionally prescribed inclusion, also contrary to Nigeria’s international commitments to eradicate discrimination against women”, the Mission stated.\t\n",
      "The Commission, however, declared the governorship election in Kebbi, Enugu, Abia and Adamawa states inconclusive as hoodlums attacked collation centres in Abia and Yola.\t\n",
      "INEC said the suspected party thugs surrounded the centre and did not allow people entrance. The stalemate was caused by the election results from Fufore local council.\t \n",

      "The incumbent governor and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate, Ahmadu Umaru Fintiri and the only female governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Aishat Dahiru Binani, are slugging it out there.\n",
      "ON suspension of collation of governorship results in Abia and Enugu, INEC said it followed Sunday’s invasion of the Commission’s office by thugs in Obingwa Local Government Area of Abia state.\t\n",
      "The Commission also said a review of the results for the governorship election from the two outstanding LGAs of Nsukka and Nkanu East in Enugu called for suspension of collation.\t \n",
      "National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee, INEC, Festus Okoye disclosed this in a statement on Monday.\t \n",
      "He said: “The Commission met today, Monday March 20, 2023 and reviewed the conduct of the governorship and state Assembly elections held nationwide on Saturday March 18, 2023. Arising from the meeting, the Commission took the decision to suspend forthwith further collation of the governorship election results in some parts of Abia and Enugu States.\n",
      "“It will be recalled that our office in Obingwa Local Government Area was invaded by thugs yesterday, Sunday March 19, 2023 and our officials held hostage in relation to the collation of results from the Local Government Area. Similarly, reports from Enugu State call for a review of the results for the governorship election from the two outstanding Local Government Areas of Nsukka and Nkanu East.\n",
      "“Consequently, the Commission hereby suspends the collation of results in Obingwa Local Government Area of Abia State and the two outstanding Local Government Areas of Enugu State, which are yet to be collated. A review will be undertaken immediately before the process is concluded.\n",
      "AS the delay lingered, protests erupted in Enugu State as supporters of the PDP and LP stormed the headquarters of INEC over the alleged manipulation of Saturday’s governorship election result.\t \n",
      "While LP had complained of over voting in Nkanu East local council on the ground that the area returned over 30,000 votes in favour of the PDP candidate, Peter Mbah, against the 7,000 accredited voters by the BVAS, the PDP protested that there were intimidation and harassment of voters in Nsukka local council. Nsukka had equally returned over 30,000 votes in favour of the LP candidate, Chijioke Edeoga.\n",

      "“It’s important to note that celebrations should always respect and be mindful of the fact that the people celebrating are inclusive of all people, regardless of political beliefs, religion or culture. \n",
      "“It’s on the foregoing that the Police command is calling on the good people of the state to respect the rules and regulations regarding gatherings and celebration of election victories,” Kiyawa said.\n",

      "PDP chairman in the state, Francis Orogu, alleged that security personnel and INEC officials connived with the APC to alter the results.\n",
      "Meanwhile APC in Bauchi State has rejected the result of Saturday’s governorship election that declared Governor Bala Mohammed as the winner.\t\n",
      "The party’s agent at the state collation centre, Abdulmumini Kundak described the election as a ‘sham’. In a letter of complaint submitted to the Resident Electoral Commissioner titled: “Complaint of massive rigging, violence and electoral malpractice, which marred the Bauchi State governorship election conducted on March 18”, the party called for cancellation of results in affected local government areas. \n",

      "The party chieftain claimed further that the same was applicable to Warji, Zaki and Kirfi local councils with massive over voting and violence. Kundak declined to assent to the INEC Form EC8 for political party agents. \n",

It is called democracy,” he added.\\nHe called for an open society where diversity can be tolerated, explaining that such made London a hub of talents.\\nJohnson, who made a case for a stronger mutually beneficial relationship between Nigeria and Britain, said it would further help both countries to unleash their potentials.\\nHe said: “Now is the time. When the world is so uncertain, when some nations are disentangling, now is the time for Britain and Nigeria, two great democracies to work together. Nigeria can be a renewable superpower and still be a producer of oil and gas. We could be much more together.”\\nOther areas for continued collaborations, according to him, include free trade, free speech and free elections.\\n“You need a society that is open and that is tolerant to develop human potentials,” he said, adding that, “urban successes are built on freedom under the law.”\\nJohnson said what London is to Britain is what Lagos is to Africa. He, however, urged Lagos State Government to improve its transportation system, noting that spending long hours in traffic can be very frustrating.\\nHe advised the state government to understudy mass transit programme of Britain and not to go to “China or Russia.”\\nAccording to him, Lagos, London and Los Angeles are the three states leading in creative industry. He paid tribute to the late Chief Executive Officer of the Africa Movie Academy Award (AMAA), Peace Maria Anyiam-Osigwe, for her efforts in developing creative industry in Africa.\\nWelcoming dignitaries to the event, Charles Anyiam-Osigwe said the lecture “is an adventure within the bounds of the submission of Emmanuel Anyiam-Osigwe on how we can vastly realise a better world order. It is in this construct that he variously espouses on man as the primary moving force of sentient existence. In his fragments, he avers that ‘man is the centre of the universe’. It is in this context that he evaluates the primacy of man as the driving wheel of sentient existence and its social order.\\n“The existence of poverty and the social disequilibrium that characterises the present world order is that man has lost contact with the attributes and definitions that qualify him as a human person. In the disconnection of his mental identity from his esoteric being, the human person loses the insight, which comes with his intuitive prowess beyond the mundane.”\\nSome of the dignitaries at the event include, President-elect, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, who was represented by former deputy governor of Lagos State, Otunba Femi Pedro, Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State, represented by his deputy, Obafemi Hamzat, former Secretary-General of the Commonwealth, Chief Emeka Anyaoku and the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), Peter Obi.\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nPedro said Tinubu is already preparing himself to take Nigeria to greater heights. He urged participants and dignitaries that graced the event to be rest assured that Nigeria is in great hands. “Nigeria is on a great journey, Tinubu is the pilot,” Pedro said.\\nAnyaoku spoke glowingly about the achievements of Mr. Johnson, especially in making the welfare of the people a priority.\\nHe said Mr. Johnson is a remarkable British politician and leader.\\n“He has so far left legacies in modern British politics. He was the Prime Minister, who followed the decision of the majority of the British people…it was he, therefore (in popular parlance) who got Brexit done.\\n“I believe if we were to effectively pursue the theme of this lecture, comprehensive welfare of the people should be the bedrock of policies and actions of politicians and actions across the world,” he stated.\\nHe enjoined Nigerians to be patriotic and avoid demeaning or de-marketing the country.\\nMeanwhile, the crisis rocking the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) got worsened as a High Court, sitting in Makurdi, Benue State, yesterday, restrained Dr. Iyorchia Ayu from parading himself as the national chairman of the party.\\nThis followed an ex-parte application filed by a chieftain of the PDP, Comrade Terhide Utaan, who sought an interim injunction restraining Ayu from further parading himself as the national chairman of the party.\\nIn suit number MHC/85/ 2023 and motion number MHC/633M/2023 between Comrade Utaan and Senator Iyorchia Ayu and the PDP as respondents, before Justice W. I. Kpochi, the plaintiff sought for an order of interim injunction, restraining the 1st defendant, Dr. Ayu from further parading himself as the national chairman of the PDP, having lost membership of the party, pending the hearing and determination of motion on notice already filed.\\nThe application was supported by a 15-paragraph affidavit, which annexed three exhibits as A1, A2 and B.\\nThe exhibits are the applicant’s membership cards of the 2nd defendants (PDP), receipts for payment of dues and the vote of no confidence passed on the first defendants (Ayu)\\xa0by his Igyorov council ward in Gboko local government.\\nJustice Kpochi adjourned the case to April 14, 2023 for further hearing.\\nThe court order followed Ayu’s suspension by his ward at the weekend for allegedly engaging in anti-party activities.\\nHowever, Ayu described his suspension as a nullity, just as he argued that only the National Executive Committee (NEC) could carry out such action.\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nAyu claimed that some members of the executive committee of his ward’s chapter of the party were teleguided by those he called political gamblers in Makurdi to cause mischief.\\nIn a statement released by his Special Adviser on Media and Communications, Simon Imobo-Tswam, he said: “Article 57(7) of the PDP Constitution as amended in 2017 expressly prohibits any organ of the party or executive committee of the party at the Ward or State level from taking any disciplinary measure against any member of the party’s National Executive Committee.”\\nA resolution passed at the end of the meeting of executives of the party at the Ward level and read by its Secretary of Igyorov, Mr. Banger Dooyum, reads: “The PDP Executive Committee of Igyorov council ward of Gboko local government area in Benue state has passed a vote of no confidence on the PDP National Chairman, Dr. Iyorchia Ayu, and suspended him from the party.”\\nMr. Dooyum, while reading the resolution of the ward Exco, said: “He (Ayu) was involved in anti-party activities, making the PDP to lose at his ward and local government along with his allies, who also didn’t vote at the governorship election.”\\nAyu was also accused of not paying his yearly dues as enshrined by the party’s constitution.\\nWorried by the development, a member of the Board of Trustees of the party, Chief Olabode George, called for calm and pleaded with the warring factions not to do anything that will exterminate the party.\\nAccording to him, Ayu made mistakes for not abiding by his promise of stepping down if a northerner emerged as the presidential candidate of the party, and so, caused the party to lose presidential election.\\nHe, however, warned party members to use post election period for reconciliation and not to finally kill the party.\\nHe said it is only the NEC that can suspend or punish Ayu or any national leader of the party, urging members in Ayu’s ward to follow due process.\\nReacting to the development, Rivers State Governor, Nyesom\\xa0Wike, said the\\xa0fight against Ayu,\\xa0has just started.\\nThe governor stated that it has now become unthinkable to allow any person, who was unable to deliver his political unit, ward, council or state for the PDP during the last general elections, to preside over the party.\\nWike stated this yesterday, during the inauguration of the remodeled Community Secondary School in Okoro-nu-Odo, in Obio-Akpor Council of the state.\\nThe governor said it would be morally offensive for Ayu to remain as the national chairman of the PDP after the catastrophic defeat of the party under his watch in his unit, ward, local government, state and national level.\\nAccording to him,\\xa0the suspension of Ayu is the beginning of the fight to save the party.',\n",

       "  'Article': 'Since the end of military juntas and the return to a democratic system of government in Nigeria about a quarter of a century ago, six (except for the latest) presidential polls have so far been conducted. None of these elections was free of contestation. The outcomes were legally disputed and battled up to the Supreme Court level in that the final decision on the officially backed winner (sworn into office) was not made at the ballot boxes but at the jury box or the courtrooms. \\n \\n\\n\\n\\nThe recent presidential election is not only headed in the same direction but also many Nigerian voters and observers (local and foreign) of the election are expressing scepticism on its outcome to a level not seen in the history of the country’s democracy, deeming it the most fraudulent elections of all time, FOAT.\\nTheir repudiation of the outcome is predicated on fact that the conduct of the elections was not consistent with the legislatively supported electoral guidelines and that the electoral body, INEC, the military, and the ruling party have colluded in pilfering votes and victories. Nationally, the mood of the people is not blissfully in tandem with the announcement of the election results as the streets were (and still) destitute of joys and jubilations that were often preceded by the conduct of robust presidential elections. \\nWhy is this ‘victory’ on probation? \\nRegarding the electoral guidelines, Nigeria is yet to adopt the use of electronic voting, but the latest Electoral Act mandates the electronic transmission of results from the polling units to the database of the electoral commission and subsequently the national collation centre where the winner will be announced by the chief returning officer, the INEC chairman. The electoral Act was well received by both the local and international communities because it will improve transparency in choosing leaders and consequently deepens the largest democracy on the African continent.  \\nThe BVAS, Bimodal Voters Accreditation System, is to the electoral process at polling booths what an invigilator is, to conduct of an academic examination in a hall or a college setting, where answer scripts (or booklets) will no longer be trusted if no invigilator is present throughout the period of the exam. Similarly, election results are severely called into question in the absence of BVAS live-transmitting results from the polling stations to collation centres. Because non-transmission (in real-time) of the results of the election is equivalent to the dismantling of the guardrails erected to protect the voting process from corruption: fraud and manipulations.\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nStatistically and historically, is it practically impossible for a candidate to win Nigeria’s presidential elections without winning the triple-K states (Kano, Katsina and Kaduna) and Lagos, plus losing in 25 (out of 36) states and the federal capital. The announced result seems to have offset this odd. At this juncture, it should be noted that the three leading candidates, according to the questionable results, won 12 states each, with wins spread across at least four of the six subregional zones.\\nWill justice roll on like a river?\\nThe election was contested by 18 candidates but only three clinched roughly 90 per cent of the total valid votes. The other two candidates with more than two-thirds of the total valid votes have vowed to reclaim their mandates through the courts. But “Will justice roll on like a river?”\\nThe supreme court as a legal institution is under question because the chief justice responsible for appointing members of the presidential election tribunal is being accused of cosying up to the ruling party and its presidential candidate. This scepticism is fuelled by recent judicial antecedents of the supreme court: e.g., the transfer of mandate from Machina to Lawal and from Akpabio to Ekpoudom. Both judgements were in favour of the party in power. There is nothing wrong with the scale of justice swinging in this direction provided the verdicts are impartial.  \\nPart of the mistrust of the judicial system is driven by antecedents. Previous executive actions have shown the judiciary arm of government is not utterly independent of the executive branch of the government in that through presidential powers, the Chief Justice of the Federation was once booted out of office on allegations of corruption. In stable democracies, justices are removed from office by at least two-thirds of the members of congress, the legislative branch of government. Nonetheless, there seems to be some ray of hope on the horizon.\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nThe two leading legal challengers of the presidential polls have had successful legal histories throughout their political careers. Mr Atiku Abubakar of PDP, then as vice president of Nigeria, won 11 legal battles against the then-sitting president. Also, Mr Peter Obi of the Labour Party repossessed two stolen electoral mandates as the governor of the richest state in the southeast region of Nigeria. Nonetheless, they seem to express shaky trust in the current judicial system. \\nA victory standing on sinking sand?\\nA government by the people will benefit from the goodwill of the people. Tellingly, a blissful marriage is a two-way street. The bride is in love with the groom and the groom is also in love with the bride. But chaos sets in and reigns in a union where the bride was foisted on the groom, or the groom is imposed on the bride.   \\nHowever, a leadership not established by the absolute will of the people will struggle to govern the people even if it promises the people streets of gold because the government – given the process in which it was vaulted to power – has failed to win the affection of the people as their wishes were subverted. Subsequently, the government becomes unpopular among the citizens, ultimately sowing and breeding the seed of rebellion by the governed. The wounds inflicted by injustice can only be healed through one means: return to the people their legitimate mandate. Finally, those (fighting for and) looking forward to a new and better Nigeria believe that the destiny of the nation is superior to the desperate and ill-driven ambition of any politician and one man cannot hold to ransom a country of more than a quarter of a billion people. Nigeria must be freed from the iron clasp of those holding back its progress.\\nTwitter: @dapelzg',\n",

       "  'Article': 'The last few weeks leading up to the elections in Nigeria have been fraught with very negative narratives, and the last days leading up to the Governorship elections in Lagos have been particularly harrowing and frankly speaking, very heartbreaking. Because of the political ambitions and greed of a few, we have seen the manipulative use of bigotry and ethnic hatred to divide what was a peacefully cohabiting and mutually beneficial economic and social community that is Lagos; Nigeria. \\n \\n\\n\\n\\nIn recent times, we have witnessed scapegoating; politicians blaming a particular ethnic group and supporters of an opposition political party for all sorts of imaginary crimes and using this to appeal to the fears and frustrations of voters. We have seen polarization; with politicians and their party supporters using very divisive rhetoric to create an us-vs-them mentality, pitting one ethnic group against another. This has resulted in extreme tribalism, with voters identifying strongly with their own ethnic group and viewing others with suspicion or hostility.\\nThese tactics are very unethical and harmful to democracy. A political party that seeks to take and hold on to power by any means necessary including state-sanctioned thuggery, violence and the encouragement of bigotry and ethnic hatred, can never form a legitimate and truly inclusive government. Politicians who use ethnic hatred to divide voters are appealing to the worst instincts of human nature, and their actions can have lasting negative effects on society.\\nThe shameful reports of electoral violence and the deliberate and coordinated disenfranchisement of Igbo voters yesterday in Lagos is wrong; and to say it plainly, setting a dangerously evil precedent. \\nBigotry and ethnic hatred have led to some of the worst atrocities in human history, including genocide, war, and oppression.  Nigeria is not a stranger to the devastating effects of ethnic hatred. The 1966 pogroms in which an estimated 10,000 to 30,000 Igbo people were killed was a tragic and traumatic event in Nigeria’s history. The violence led to increased ethnic tensions in the country and contributed to the outbreak of the Nigerian Civil War in 1967.  That 3 year war resulted in the deaths of an estimated 1-3 million people, mostly Igbos.\\nNigeria has still not completely healed from that conflict.\\nThat is why it is completely selfish and evil for anyone to stroke the embers of ethnic hatred through the use of stereotypes, ethnic slurs, pushing of false narratives, uninformed and biased opinions because of political differences. \\n \\n\\n\\n\\nThe outright discrimination and violence that have been meted out to fellow Nigerians of Igbo extraction is evil and must be stopped. These attitudes undermine the very fabric of our society, eroding the trust and mutual respect that are essential for social harmony.\\nAs individuals, we can take steps to combat bigotry and ethnic hatred. We need to refuse to be manipulated and speak loudly against this evil everywhere. We need to deliberately examine ourselves, challenge our own biases, and speak out against prejudice when we encounter it. \\nThe beauty of being Nigerian is how we can be diverse in our culture, lifestyles, languages, religions and beliefs but are still united in the love of our country and unique “Nigerianess”. Greedy politicians should not be allowed to take that away from us. \\nIt is time to deliberately build bridges of understanding and dialogue between our different communities. Politicians clearly will not do it for us, so we must stand up for ourselves and speak up in defence of one another.\\nAbove all, let us remember that we human together.\\nFola Folayan is a Rwanda-based media consultant and communications strategist.',\n",

       "  'Article': 'The Labour Party Governorship candidate in Lagos, Gbadebo Rhodes-Vivour, yesterday said what happened in Lagos on March 18, 2023, was far from democracy but an Agberocracy.\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nHe said this while rejecting the declaration of Babajide Sanwo-Olu as the winner of the election.\\nHe said the violence was witnessed across Lagos State and the people were not allowed to exercise the right to choose who governs them.\\n“I want to say a big thanks to the people that had the courage to come out and ensure they participated and expressed their civic rights. I also want to pay condolences to several families that lost their loved ones to needless killing in an attempt to practice their civic right which is to vote for their preferred candidate. \\n“There are also several others that were hurt in the process. We have been supporting them medically in terms of taking up the bills and giving them support, and we will continue doing that for the rest of this week.  \\n“What we witnessed in Lagos was state-backed terrorism, there is no other way to say it. And I call on all the good people of Lagos from the captain of industries to religious leaders, our traditional rulers to speak up against what the APC government has turned our elections into.\\n“Elections are meant to be a democracy for the people, by the people and of the people. What we saw yesterday (March 18) was Agberocracy, thuggery, hooliganism at its finest, a government by the thugs, for thugs and by the thugs, and this cannot be acceptable. It is a wrong precedent to set because the next time people want to participate in elections, they will believe it must be violent, it must be war. And Lagos deserves so much more than that. There is no government that should be maiming its citizens in an aspiration to lead the same people.\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n“This ethnic division that APC brought into our politics will have a long-term effect on the state and it is not just politics. As of today, people were at Alaba market trying to set it up on fire. These are the real-life consequences of the political thuggery that the APC turned this election into, and we need to rise against it.\\n“We have been saving results, every 30 minutes it has been downloaded and uploaded on irev, and we noticed that they have already started manipulating and changing these results. The results they uploaded are very different from the results we have at our collation centres and we are tabulating, and it shows us clearly we are in the lead.\\n“An example is the result at Ota Primary School, where 20 votes for the APC have been turned to 120, 67 for LP turned to 7, and 43 for the PDP turned to another figure. This is what INEC is doing, and they are supposed to be an umpire, fortunately, we have all our results and will challenge this evil that INEC in collaboration with the ruling party has done to disenfranchise so many voters in Lagos State.\\n“Entire agents of ours, even in Ikeja were chased away from their polling units, In Surulere, Oshodi-Isolo, Amuwo Odofin, Ojo, people were forced to vote and declare at gunpoint. Elections are supposed to be periods where people are meant to exercise their rights as against the frustrations they have experienced in the country. It is not supposed to be war, and we don’t want that precedent because nobody has a monopoly of violence, and we cannot afford for our Lagos to be exposed to this.\\n“I urge all our supporters, I understand how frustrated they are, but I want them to be rest assured that we are going to challenge this evil by INEC in partnership with every agency involved in the manipulation including the police that was watching ballot boxes being snatched. We are going to challenge it in the court of law and we are going to fight for every vote that was cast for us.',\n",
