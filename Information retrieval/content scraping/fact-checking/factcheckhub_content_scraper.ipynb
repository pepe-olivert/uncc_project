      "Findings by The FactCheckHub revealed that the claim is FALSE. A check on Atiku’s Instagram and Twitter pages show that he did not post such crucial statement on his social media platforms. Further checks revealed that no credible media platform also published the report. The FactCheckHub reached out to Paul Ibe, the spokesperson to Atiku Abubakar, via a telephone call.

The press statement reads thus: PRESS RELEASE I’ll never validate an illegitimate outcome of a flawed process I have been notified of a fake press release attributed to me and purportedly giving legitimacy to the widely rigged presidential election of February 25. The so-called press release did not emanate from me or my office, and it should be treated with repudiation, untrue, and deliberately contrived by those who illegally appropriated the mandate of the Nigerian people. For the avoidance of any doubt, I wish to state categorically that my lawyers still have my unflinching mandate to challenge the outcome of the February 25 presidential election. I join other lovers of democracy in Nigria and friends of our great country in the outright rejection of the pre-determined outcome of the February 25 election. I shall continue to challenge the legality of that election, alongside my party, the Peoples Democratic Party. The decision to challenge the sham election of February 25, the worst election in our democratic history, is not predicated on my personal interest but the interest of Nigeria and its people. It is aimed at deepening democracy and ensuring that we do not confer legitimacy to an outcome of illegitimacy. My commitment to the democratic struggle in Nigeria is beyond an election season.

      "Findings by The FactCheckHub show that the claim is FALSE. Labour Party was created in 2002 initially by the Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC) and was previously known as Party for Social Democracy (PSD) but changed the name in 2003 after Nigeria’s general election at the time. The party had Sylvester Ejiofor, a veteran of many labour struggles as its first national chairman. After the change of name, Dan Nwanyanwu and Alhaji A.A. Salam took over the mantle of leadership as national chairman and national secretary respectively. In 2006, Nwanyanwu formally presented Olusegun Mimiko, to the people of Ondo state as the party’s gubernatorial flag-bearer for the 2007 election in the state. In 2008, the Ondo state Election PetitionTtribunal nullified the election of Olusegun Agagu, governorship candidate of the PDP and declared Olusegun Mimiko who contested under the Labour Party (LP) platform as the winner of the April 14, 2007 gubernatorial election. The judgement of the tribunal was upheld by the Appeal court in Benin which stated that Mimiko won 25 per cent of the valid votes in 13 out of the 18 local government areas in the state.\n",

Apart from the image and headline, no detailed report was seen on it. When the headline was subjected to a search using Google lens and Google reverse image tools, it displayed a report published four years ago by thebiafrastar.com, which content is no longer accessible on the internet. Screenshot of the Google search conducted on the headline. Further search shows that no credible media platform reported the claim attributed to the INEC chairman. When contacted, Rotimi Oyekanmi, the Chief Press Secretary/Media Adviser to the INEC chairman, told the FactCheckHub: “It’s fake. At no time did the INEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu speak about his life being at risk. This is the work of mischief makers. Prof. Yakubu’s life is not at risk. He is fine.”\n",

      "Findings by The FactCheckHub shows that the claim is FALSE. When the web link in the text message was subjected to verification, the result shows that it’s typically a phishing website. Screenshot of the phishing web link when clicked. INSERT: False verdict. A click on the link will take users to a website which asks users to fill in their personal details excluding bank information, and then ask them to click the “apply” button. Further click on the ‘apply’ button will pop up three questions, asking users to answer them. They questions are: which party won the 2023 presidential election, what is your marital status and what is the name of newly elected Kwara Central senator. After answering the questions, users will be asked to input their phone number and share the link to 15 different friends or 5 WhatsApp groups to claim the N10,000 fund. After submission, it takes users back to the registration page for another round of registration similar to the initial one. Screenshot of the phishing web link after filling and submitting the form. INSERT: False verdict. The FactCheckHub had earlier published tutorial on how to identify phishing scams and websites. You can read it here. In addition, Saliu Mustapha’s media office has debunked the claim in a press statement. The Senator-elect’s media office said that the alleged scheme labelled “Sen. Soliu Mustapha N10,000 Complimentary Fund” is operated by unknown fraudsters who could not even spell the candidate’s name correctly. The statement partly reads: “According to information at our disposal, the fraudsters behind the scheme asked unsuspecting members to apply for a token of appreciation following Mallam Saliu Mustapha’s election victory. “The media office of the Senator-elect refutes the alleged scheme and any other claims made in this manner.”\n",

      "Tinubu was the first governor in Nigeria to raise bond for infrastructure and development in Nigeria.\n",
      "\n",
      "Evidence:\n",
      "A bond, according to Investopedia, is a fixed-income instrument that represents a loan made by an investor to a borrower (typically corporate or governmental). A bond could be thought of as an I.O.U. between the lender and borrower, including the loan details and its payments. Bonds are used by companies, states, and sovereign governments to finance projects and operations. Owners of bonds are debt-holders, or creditors, of the issuer. Bond details include the end date when the principal of the loan is due to be paid to the bond owner and usually include the terms for variable or fixed interest payments made by the borrower. The Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) defined a bond as tradable security issued by the borrower (bond issuer) representing a formal agreement to repay the lender (the bondholder) the full amount plus interest over the lifetime of the bond. In Nigeria, a bond may be publicly placed (i.e., listed on an exchange for trading) for trading by the public or maybe a private placement, sold to qualified investors, i.e., institutional investors (like Pension Funds, Banks, etc.) and high net worth individuals. Findings by The ICIR revealed that in 1978, the old Bendel state government headed by Husaini Abdullahi, a military governor took a bond, this preceded Tinubu’s administration in Lagos state. The Bendel State Loan Stock valued at N20 million was taken to develop housing estate in the region. The bond matured in 1988 at a 7 per cent coupon rate. Then, there was a bond taken by the Ogun State Revenue Bond, which took a N15 million, 10-year bond in 1986 for the development of a water project. When the bond was taken, Raji Alagbe Rasaki was the state’s military governor. Between 1987 and 1988, the Lagos State Revenue Bond issued a total sum of N90 million bond for the development of the Lekki Peninsula. Mike Akhigbe was the military governor then. In 1987, the first Oyo State Revenue Bond of N30 million for Adamasingba Shopping Complex and Gbagi Market Development was a 12-year bond. The Kaduna State Revenue Bond took a N60 million bond between 1989 and 1993 for the development of Ginger factory. Abdullahi Sarki Mukhtar and Lawal Jafaru Isa were the military governor and administrators, respectively, within these periods. The Edo State Revenue Bond took a N1 billion bond in 2000 for the development of Ogba Riverside Housing Estate. Lucky Igbinedion was the elected executive governor. The same year, the Delta State Revenue Bond, which took N3.5 billion to develop market, healthcare, water and education in the state. James Ibori was the governor. In 2002, Yobe State Revenue Bond and Ekiti State Revenue Bond took bonds for various developmental projects in their states, respectively. The Lagos State government under Tinubu in 2002 took N15 billion bond through the Lagos State Bond for the refinance of developmental projects in the state. As of February 26, 2015, Lagos State was leading other states with a total of N290.09 billion in bond issuance. The highest was N87.5 billion government Bond – Series 2 under the N167.5 billion debt issuance programme of 2013 for maturity in 2020. The bond raised, which was issued at a 13.5 coupon rate, was meant for infrastructure developments (roads, rail, buildings and bridges etc), health facilities, Adiyan Water Project Phase II construction, and shoreline protection work. Lagos had in 2012 issued a N80 billion bond under the Series 1 of the N167.5 billion debt issuance programme at a 14.5 per cent coupon rate for construction of Adiyan Waterworks (Phase II), infrastructure developments (roads, rail, buildings and bridges etc.), health facilities and redevelopment of Eric Moore Schools (Phase I).\n",

My team and I just arrived at the Government House in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, for the Commissioning of a new Flyover constructed by HE @GovWike. -PO pic.twitter.com/u3tI1h6reG — Peter Obi (@PeterObi) November 17, 2022 That was not the first time Governor Wike would invite a member of an opposition party for project commissioning in Rivers State. He had earlier invited the current Nigeria’s Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo, Speaker of the Federal House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, and a former Edo state governor, Adams Oshiomole, who were all members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) to commission some of the projects executed by his administration.

      "Reno Omokri joins APC supporters in London to campaign for Bola Tinubu at Chatham House.\n",
      "\n",
      "Evidence:\n",
      "Findings by The FactCheckHub show the claim is FALSE. The Chatham House is an independent policy institute headquartered in London. The group, also recognised as the Royal Institute of International Affairs, has become a place most presidential political candidates visit to showcase their agenda, especially as they get close to the election period. A former Nigerian Vice President, Atiku Abubakar, was at the Chatham House in April 2018. Meanwhile, an analysis of the video showed that contrary to the claim, Reno was actually using derogatory words against Tinubu in a protest at the same location (Chatham House). Screenshot of the tweeted video showing Reno Omokri was protesting against Tinubu’s candidacy in London on Monday with a placard that reads: ‘No to a drug baron in Aso Rock.’ Research showed that there were two camps around the Chatham House, a camp loyal to Tinubu, and Reno’s Camp (who were protesting against Tinubu’s candidacy). Armed with a megaphone, Reno had earlier displayed a placard with an inscription – “No To a Drug Baron in Aso Rock.” A fellow protester was with another placard with the inscription – “Nigerians Reject Bola Escobar And His Heroin Cartel.” They chanted demonstration songs amid the protests, findings revealed. In a separate video of about 39 seconds from the same location, Omokri and his team yelled in Yoruba language – ‘Tinubu Ole’, literally translated to mean “Tinubu is a thief” in English. However, due to the rival groups’ proximity in the controversial footage, pro-Tinubu supporters rather ended Omokri’s chanting with “Tinubu for president” as the two protesting groups shout.\n",

      "According to a recent report by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on multi-dimensional poverty, about 133 million people in the country, representing 63 per cent of the population, are living in different categories of poverty. The report stated that 65 per cent of the poor (86 million people) live in the North, while 35 per cent (nearly 47 million) live in the South. The National Multi-Dimensional Poverty Index (MPI) report is 0.257, indicating that poor people in Nigeria experience just over one-quarter of all possible deprivations. The report stresses that poverty levels across states vary significantly, with the incidence of multi-dimensional poverty ranging from a low of 27 per cent in Ondo to a high of 91 per cent in Sokoto. According to the report, over half of the population of Nigeria are multi-dimensionally poor and cook with dung, wood or charcoal, rather than with cleaner energy. According to the report, high deprivations are also apparent nationally in sanitation, healthcare, food insecurity, and housing. Accordingly, the incidence of monetary poverty is lower than the incidence of MPI across most states. In Nigeria, 40.1 per cent of people had been deemed poor, according to the 2018/19 national monetary poverty line, but 63 per cent have now been regarded multi-dimensionally poor according to the National MPI 2022.\n",

Checks using keyword searches online show that the video had surfaced online with similar claims around June 2022 after the PDP presidential primary election. Analysis of the video shows that it was cut from Wike’s interview with Arise TV broadcast on July 2021. In the original video, Wike was reacting to the defection of some governors and legislators from the PDP to the ruling APC. Prior to the interview, PDP had lost three governors and other party members to the APC in the space of seven months. The River State governor responded to the question by the Arise TV anchor, Oseni Rufai, who asked if the reason members of the party, especially from the South-East, were leaving the party was because the party did not consider zoning. In the full video (29:00-32:00 minutes), Wike argued that the defectors could not justify their reasons for leaving the party. He added that their reasons should be in the interest of their people and their region and not because of their political relevance. “What makes you a man is to be able to tell your people a simple truth,” Wike said. Citing an instance, he said in the 57 minutes video: “I am leaving PDP to APC today because PDP have not done anything for South-South, PDP have not done anything in Rivers State, PDP have not done anything for my people. I would catalogue everything. I’m leaving PDP to APC. See the reasons why I’m leaving PDP to join you. Tell me, are you willing to do all these things that PDP didn’t do for me….” Meanwhile, Kelvin Ebiri, the Media Aide to Wike, had in June 2022 debunked the viral video, adding that it should be disregarded.\n",

Prior to the interview, PDP had lost three governors and other party members to the APC in the space of seven months. The River State governor responded to the question by the Arise TV anchor, Oseni Rufai, who asked if the reason members of the party, especially from the South-East, were leaving the party was because the party did not consider zoning. In the full video (29:00-32:00 minutes), Wike argued that the defectors could not justify their reasons for leaving the party. He added that their reasons should be in the interest of their people and their region and not because of their political relevance. “What makes you a man is to be able to tell your people a simple truth,” Wike said. Citing an instance, he said in the 57 minutes video: “I am leaving PDP to APC today because PDP have not done anything for South-South, PDP have not done anything in Rivers State, PDP have not done anything for my people. I would catalogue everything. I’m leaving PDP to APC. See the reasons why I’m leaving PDP to join you. Tell me, are you willing to do all these things that PDP didn’t do for me….” Meanwhile, Kelvin Ebiri, the Media Aide to Wike, had in June 2022 debunked the viral video, adding that it should be disregarded.', 'FALSE', '04-11-2022', 'https://factcheckhub.com/false-claim-that-nyesom-wike-has-defected-to-apc-resurfaces-online/')\n",

      "Evidence:\n",
      "Findings by The FactCheckHub show that Obi’s claim is MOSTLY TRUE. The “2019 Poverty and Inequality in Nigeria” by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) remains the most authoritative data report on the state-by-state poverty rate in Nigeria. The report stated that 40 percent of the total population, or almost 83 million people, lives below the country’s poverty line of $381.75 per year. According to the report, most of the poorest states in the country are mostly from northern Nigeria. In fact, the report indicates that nine of the top 10 states with the highest poverty rates are from the northern region. However, Ebonyi, which is in the Southeastern geo-political region of the country, was ranked among the top 10 poorest states. NBS’ 2019 Poverty index rate in Nigeria They are Sokoto state (87.73%), Taraba state (87.72%), Jigawa state (87.02%), Ebonyi state (79.76%), Adamawa state (75.41%), Zamfara state (73.98%), Yobe state (72.34%), Niger state (66.11%), Gombe state (62.31%) Bauchi state (61.53%).\n",

      "Checks by Daily Trust show that the claims by Tinubu in the period under review are INACCURATE.\n",
      "\n",
      "Evidence:\n",
      "Checks by Daily Trust show that the claims by Tinubu in the period under review are INACCURATE. Data from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) shows that Nigeria recorded an average oil production of 2.05 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2011; 1.9 million bpd in 2012; 1.7 million bpd in 2013; and 1.8 million bpd in 2014. Similarly, Nigeria’s average annual price of crude oil in 1999 was about $17.4 per barrel. It rose to $27.6 in 2000, dropped to $23.1 in 2001, and maintained a slight increase in 2002($24.3), 2003($28.1) and in 2004(36.5) respectively, data from the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) as quoted by Statista, a data analysis platform showed. The data revealed that oil sold for $50.5 per barrel in 2005, $61 in 2006, $69 in 2007, $94.1 in 2008, $60.8 in 2009 and in 2010, the oil price was $77.3. In 2011, the average annual price of oil had gotten to a record high of $107 per barrel, increasing to $109 per barrel in 2012, $105.8 in 2013 and touched $96.2 in 2014 and partly in 2015 before President Buhari took over. This clearly shows that President Buhari didn’t take over a government with the worst oil production pricing as claimed by Tinubu. Also, OPEC data shows the highest price ever paid for crude oil was between June and July 2008, when a barrel of crude oil was sold for around $130 to $147, although the average crude oil price in 2008 ended up being $94.45 per barrel. Background Although Nigeria earns huge amounts of money from crude oil sales, fuel subsidy payment has done more harm than good to its revenues. As it stands, Nigeria does not have an accurate figure on how many litres are consumed by citizens as the figures quoted range between 50 million litres per day to around 103 million litres. Findings show that Nigeria spent N758.1 billion to cater for the cost of petroleum shortfall in the first quarter of 2022. According to media reports, Nigeria incurred a subsidy cost of N210.3 billion in January 2022, N219.783 billion in February, and N328.004 billion in March. Analysts have argued that the subsidy cost denies the country value that could have accrued from higher oil prices. The Petroleum Industry Act 2021 (PIA 2021), although suspended for now to accommodate subsidy payments from now till June 2023, is reported to be the game changer in Nigeria’s petroleum sector.\n",

Section 60(1) of the Act provides that the presiding officer shall, after counting the votes at a polling unit, enter the votes scored by each candidate in a form to be prescribed by the commission. “Section 60(5) of the Act makes it mandatory that the presiding officer shall transfer the results, including the total number of accredited voters and the results of the ballot, in a manner prescribed by the commission. After recording and announcing the results, the presiding officer shall then deliver the same along with election materials under security and accompanied by the candidates or their polling agents, where available to such person as may be prescribed by the commission. “The implication of this is that the collation process of results is still essentially manual, but the collation officer must collate subject to his verification and confirmation that the number of accredited voters stated on the collated result is correct and consistent with the number of accredited voters recorded and transmitted directly from polling units.” Notwithstanding, other political actors have begun to question INEC’s announcement.

      "Claim:\n",
      "That Osun state has not had any serious case of banditry, kidnapping and armed robbery since Gboyega Oyetola became governor of the state.\n",
      "\n",
      "Evidence:\n",
      "Checks by The FactCheckHub show that the claim is MOSTLY FALSE. While it is true that Osun is one of the states in Nigeria with few cases of violent attacks, findings by The FactCheckHub show that several cases of armed attacks have been recorded in the state under the Oyetola-led government. Preceded by Rauf Aregbesola, Oyetola assumed office as the governor of Osun State on the 27th of November, 2018. Analysing data from Nigeria Security Tracker (NST), a project of the Council on Foreign Relations’ Africa programme documents and maps violence in Nigeria that is motivated by political, economic, or social grievances, The FactCheckHub filtered out cases of armed violence recorded in Osun state between November 2018 when Oyetola assumed office up till July 2022 when he made the statement. The data shows that more than 100 cases of armed attacks ranging from armed robbery, communal clashes, and kidnapping, among others have been reported in Osun state under Oyetola’s administration. The data shows that the state has experienced no fewer than 20 cases of armed attacks in 2022 alone. The FactCheckHub highlights some instances of kidnapping, armed robbery and other cases of armed attacks recorded in the state during Oyetola’s tenure. Armed Robbery Armed robbers attacked a branch of Wema Bank Plc in Iragbiji, Boripe LGA of Osun state on September 28, 2021. The attack claimed the lives of two policemen who tried to thwart the robbery incident. The attack came barely two months after robbers attacked two commercial banks in Iree, Osun State. The gunmen killed one person and wreaked havoc on customers and members of staff of the banks. In a similar development, gunmen attacked a bank in Okuku, a city in Osun state on the 11th of March, 2021. The Punch reported that a commercial motorcyclist and a policeman were shot dead during the incident. On the 2nd of June 2021, armed robbers attacked two banks and a police station in Ikire and Apomu, Irewole and Isokan local government areas of Osun State. The attacks claimed the lives of seven people, the Premium Times reported. Armed robbers also attacked Ifelodun Microfinance Bank, Ikirun in Osun State. The robbers tied some hunters, broke an Automated Teller Machine, and carted away the money in it, according to a report by The Punch. Banditry and Kidnapping On the 4th of December, 2018, Gunmen kidnapped nine persons in an attack near the Osun State College of Technology, OSCOTEH, Esa-Oke. The gunmen also reportedly killed one person in the attack. Also on the 23rd of September, 2019, suspected Fulani herdsmen attacked a commercial bus in Ajeoku Village in Obokun Local Government Area of Osun State and kidnapped some passengers. The NST puts the value of kidnapped victims at eighteen. In a similar development, gunmen shot one person and kidnapped two others in Iwo on the 2nd of November, 2019. At least seven persons were kidnapped along the Ilesha- Akure Expressway by suspected armed Fulani herdsmen on the 8th of February, 2021. Similarly, a senior lawyer in Ibadan, Oyo State, Musibau Adetunmbi was also kidnapped in Iwaraja, Osun State on the 16th of April 2021. Also, two Chinese expatriates were abducted at a mining site located in Okepa/Itikan village in Ifewara, Atakumosa-West local government area of the state on the 5th of April, 2021. The abduction came barely two months after three Chinese were abducted and their police guard killed in the state. Furthermore, bandits invaded Ilupeju area, Ofatedo community in Egbedore Local Government Area of Osun State on the 29th of June, 2022. The Nation newspaper reported that the bandits had written a threat letter to the community demanding N20 million before the attack. On the 28th of August, 2021, gunmen killed two persons and kidnapped three others in Alapata village of Modakeke area of the state. Similarly, no fewer than five people were killed in Ilesha during clashes between two rival cult groups and suspected land grabbers on the 29th of January, 2022. In addition, on the 21st of February 2022, a clash between rival cult groups in some areas at Ilesha, Osun State, claimed the lives of about ten people.\n",

In a tweet archived here, a Twitter account with the username, @RealSamboFatiu posted the same image on the 9th of July 2022 with a caption that suggested that the image was from the just concluded Eid Mubarak celebrations.

When contacted by The FactCheckHub, the Chief Press Secretary to the INEC chairman, Rotimi Oyekanmi clarified that the claim is false. “The Independent National Electoral Commission has an official method of making Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) available for collection by their owners, also referred to as registered voters. “Our officials do not and cannot embark on a house-to-house distribution of PVCs. That is against our official policy,” Oyekanmi said. “The standard practice is that, voters go to the INEC local government office covering the area where they registered to physically collect their PVCs. And before doing so, they are expected to sign or thumbprint on our designated forms for record purposes.” He also clarified that the viral photo should be ignored as it has nothing to do with the voter’s registration for the 2023 general election.\n",

Further checks led to a different article written in Hausa and published in Premium Times, clarifying that the Emir did not author the quote.

The FactCheckHub also reached out to the Police Public Relations Officer of Enugu State Police Command, Daniel Ndukwe Ekea, who affirmed that no such event happened in the state last weekend. “It has been debunked. It is an old story. The candidate was not assassinated, and no such thing happened in the state,” he said. The media aide of the PDP governorship candidate, Dan Nwomeh, in a statement also debunked the assassination of his principal. “We have been inundated with calls over fake news in circulation on some social media platforms on the purported assassination of the Enugu state PDP governorship flagbearer, Peter Ndubuisi Mbah. “Our investigations indicate that the story was doctored from the video of the unfortunate gruesome assassination of one Dr. Ndubuisi (real name: Professor Samuel Ndubuisi), the director-general of the Science and Equipment Development Institute (SEDI), along the Enugu – Port Harcourt expressway. “It is the mere coincidence of “Ndubuisi” in the two names that have been twisted by some devious and malevolent characters to spread unfounded panic and alarm amongst our genuinely concerned teeming supporters and well-wishers in Enugu State and beyond. “We condemn this wicked, ill-conceived misinformation and urge the masterminds to play politics of moderation and sportsmanship, have the fear of God and develop respect for the sanctity of human life,” the statement read.\n",

Investigation revealed that the video was first published online in a news report on the murder of Professor Samuel Ndubuisi, the then Director-General of the Science Equipment Development Institute (SEDI), Enugu state along the Enugu – Port Harcourt Expressway on the 7th of July, 2021. It was also reported by several media houses including TVCNews, The NEWS, The Sun newspaper and Daily Trust, among others same day. The FactCheckHub also reached out to the Police Public Relations Officer of Enugu State Police Command, Daniel Ndukwe Ekea, who affirmed that no such event happened in the state last weekend. “It has been debunked. It is an old story. The candidate was not assassinated, and no such thing happened in the state,” he said. The media aide of the PDP governorship candidate, Dan Nwomeh, in a statement also debunked the assassination of his principal. “We have been inundated with calls over fake news in circulation on some social media platforms on the purported assassination of the Enugu state PDP governorship flagbearer, Peter Ndubuisi Mbah. “Our investigations indicate that the story was doctored from the video of the unfortunate gruesome assassination of one Dr. Ndubuisi (real name: Professor Samuel Ndubuisi), the director-general of the Science and Equipment Development Institute (SEDI), along the Enugu – Port Harcourt expressway. “It is the mere coincidence of “Ndubuisi” in the two names that have been twisted by some devious and malevolent characters to spread unfounded panic and alarm amongst our genuinely concerned teeming supporters and well-wishers in Enugu State and beyond. “We condemn this wicked, ill-conceived misinformation and urge the masterminds to play politics of moderation and sportsmanship, have the fear of God and develop respect for the sanctity of human life,” the statement read.', 'FALSE', '30-05-2022', 'https://factcheckhub.com/false-video-circulates-that-enugu-pdp-governorship-candidate-was-killed/')\n"

A screenshot of the landing page of the phishing website. The FactCheckHub observed that the page attempts to collect basic information like the names, phone numbers, and email addresses of users. When the website was subjected to verification on Whois – an internet tool for verifying domain names’ registration information, findings revealed that it was created on the 19th of January 2022, with New Jersey (USA) as its current IP location. The weblink automatically redirects to another phishing website, which was created on the 8th of August, 2021 with the same IP location as the former. The FactCheckHub also reached out to the Director, Media and Strategy for The Ademola Adeleke Campaign Organization, Olawale Rasheed, who clearly stated that the claim is FALSE. Olawale, in a WhatsApp conversation with The FactCheckHub stated that he had issued a disclaimer to debunk the news, adding that it is a scam. “There is no truth in that scam. We issued a disclaimer when the fake news was going viral. It was widely circulated then. Senator Ademola Adeleke is not giving any grant to anybody. He is also not soliciting for campaign fund,” he stated.

      "Evidence:\n",
      "Findings by the FactCheckHub show that before Saraki, there have been many groups who reportedly raised funds to purchase nomination and expression of interest forms for Nigerian politicians to contest elective positions. Here are a few instances of politicians who received the same gesture to contest for a presidential seat: (1) Atiku Abubakar: On the 18th of March, 2022 – a few days before Saraki’s announcement, a business forum named North East Business Forum purchased the 2023 Presidential Nomination and Expression of Interest forms for the former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar. The group, who later presented the forms to Atiku, a presidential hopeful at his Abuja residence, said the gesture was in fulfilment of their promise in 2021 to purchase the forms for him. The former president reportedly received the same gesture in 2018. (2) Muhammadu Buhari: The FactCheckHub recalled that in 2018, the incumbent Nigerian president, Muhammadu Buhari, also received the same gesture from a group called the National Consolidation Ambassadors Network (NCAN). The group paid a sum of N45 million for his nomination and expression of interest forms in 2018 to contest under the aegis of All Progressives Congress (APC). (3) Aminu Waziri Tambuwal: In 2014, some friends and political associates of the governor of Sokoto State, Aminu Waziri Tambuwal also bought him a nomination form to contest in the 2015 presidential election under the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC). There are also several instances of Nigerian politicians who received free nomination forms from support groups to contest for other elective positions as can be seen here and here.\n",

CLAIM2: 28 million Nigerians voted in the 2019 general election Findings show the claim is MOSTLY TRUE; This is because the number of people who voted is slightly higher than the number Moghalu gave. Although, Moghalu did not specify if he was referring to the presidential election but the data obtained from the INEC on the 2019 general election show that a total of 28.6 million (28,614,190) votes were cast in the last presidential election.

      "CLAIM 1: Are elections held in North Korea every 4 to 5 years? Report shows that the claim is true. In 2014, the Independent, a British newspaper reported that elections in North Korea is held every five years. The FactCheckHub findings show that the first election after Kim Jong-Un took over from his father was in 2014. He was later reelected in 2019, which is five years later. CLAIM 2: Kim Jong-Un has been contesting unopposed Report shows that the claim is true. North Korea analyst Fyodor Tertitskiy, who is based in the South Korean capital Seoul told the BBC that only one candidate is on the ballot paper. He explained that once it’s your turn, you receive a ballot paper with just one name on it. There’s nothing to fill in, no boxes to tick. You take that paper and put it into the ballot box, which is located in the open. He also clarifies that, even though there is only a name on the ballot paper , there are actually three different factions in parliament, “The Workers Party, of which Kim Jong-un is the chairman, is by far the biggest but a few seats are usually held by two other parties, the Social Democratic party and the Chondoist Chongu party”. The Independent report and another BBC report also put forward that only state approved candidate are placed on the ballot.\n",

      "Edo state is one of the states that hold off-season elections in the country. The Gubernatorial election in the state does not follow the timetable for the country’s general election. One of the front-line contenders among the candidates for the Edo 2020 election is Godwin Obaseki, a former member of the All Progressives Congress (APC), who is also the incumbent governor of the state. He is now the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for the election. Obaseki became governor in 2016 through the APC platform. The other contender is Osagie Ize-Iyamu who is the candidate of the APC. He was the candidate for the PDP in the Edo 2016 election. The NBS is the national body saddled with the responsibility of coordinating, researching and producing official statistics for Nigeria. In carrying out its duty, it is expected to be non-partisan. Therefore, having the PDP logo on an infograph being circulated days to an election in Edo state was a red flag. Another red flag is the incomplete data on the poster; as the South-South states’ unemployment rates were stated without specifying the year and the quarter. Furthermore, when The FactCheckHub contacted the NBS information desk, they said the infograph did not emanate from them. “We cannot do a poster like this,” says Sunday J. Ichedi, the Head, Public Affairs & International Relations Unit of the NBS in a phone interview. Also, in response to the image sent to his WhatsApp, Ichedi said “The correct thing should have been source\n",

Checks using keyword searches online show that the video had surfaced online with similar claims around June 2022 after the PDP presidential primary election. Analysis of the video shows that it was cut from Wike’s interview with Arise TV broadcast on July 2021. In the original video, Wike was reacting to the defection of some governors and legislators from the PDP to the ruling APC. Prior to the interview, PDP had lost three governors and other party members to the APC in the space of seven months. The River State governor responded to the question by the Arise TV anchor, Oseni Rufai, who asked if the reason members of the party, especially from the South-East, were leaving the party was because the party did not consider zoning. In the full video (29:00-32:00 minutes), Wike argued that the defectors could not justify their reasons for leaving the party. He added that their reasons should be in the interest of their people and their region and not because of their political relevance. “What makes you a man is to be able to tell your people a simple truth,” Wike said. Citing an instance, he said in the 57 minutes video: “I am leaving PDP to APC today because PDP have not done anything for South-South, PDP have not done anything in Rivers State, PDP have not done anything for my people. I would catalogue everything. I’m leaving PDP to APC. See the reasons why I’m leaving PDP to join you. Tell me, are you willing to do all these things that PDP didn’t do for me….” Meanwhile, Kelvin Ebiri, the Media Aide to Wike, had in June 2022 debunked the viral video, adding that it should be disregarded.',\n",

Charly Boy indeed referred to a recent interview granted by the INEC’s National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee, Festus Okoye, where he said election results would be collated manually. Okoye said the election would be collated manually in the interviews but explained the difference between collation and transmission of results. He states, “There is a marked difference between the transfer/transmission of results and the collation. Section 50(2) of the Electoral Act, 2022 gives the commission the absolute discretion to determine the mode and procedure of voting in an election and the transmission of election results. “Sections 60 and 62 of the Electoral Act govern post-election procedure and collation of election results. Section 60(1) of the Act provides that the presiding officer shall, after counting the votes at a polling unit, enter the votes scored by each candidate in a form to be prescribed by the commission. “Section 60(5) of the Act makes it mandatory that the presiding officer shall transfer the results, including the total number of accredited voters and the results of the ballot, in a manner prescribed by the commission. After recording and announcing the results, the presiding officer shall then deliver the same along with election materials under security and accompanied by the candidates or their polling agents, where available to such person as may be prescribed by the commission. “The implication of this is that the collation process of results is still essentially manual, but the collation officer must collate subject to his verification and confirmation that the number of accredited voters stated on the collated result is correct and consistent with the number of accredited voters recorded and transmitted directly from polling units.” Notwithstanding, other political actors have begun to question INEC’s announcement. A former presidential aspirant of the African Democratic Congress (ADC), Kingsley Moghalu, posted a thread of tweets at 5:33 p.m. the same day expressing concern. “@inecnigeria now says election results will be manually collated and transmitted? OK o! Is my not being on the ballot for 2023 a blessing in disguise after all? Like I said, I will remain engaged in nation-building from a nonpartisan standpoint,” his tweet thread partly read. INEC’s Press Release clarifying the Electronic Transmission of Election Result. Another Twitter user, Joseph Jonas (via @JosephJoJonas), warns INEC of the imminent problems if it goes ahead with its ‘decision’. “Make you warn dem oo, because they are looking for our Trouble,” he tweeted at 5:34 p.m on Sunday. INEC has, however, issued a press release clarifying the statement of its senior staff. “For clarity, the procedure for result transmission remains the same as in recent Governorship elections in Ekiti and Osun States. There will be no change in all future elections, including the 2023 General Election. “We wish to reassure Nigerians that the electronic transmission of results has come to stay. It adds to the credibility and transparency of the process when citizens follow polling unit-level results on the INEC Result Viewing (IReV) portal in real-time on Election Day. There will be no change or deviation in subsequent elections,” the statement partly read.

Munir Sanusi Bayero, Danburam Kano, and Chief of Staff to His Highness, Khalifa Muhammad Sanusi II, CON in a statement published by Daily Trust on Monday debunked the article. “Our attention has been drawn to an article circulating the online media space analysing the motives of the three presidential candidates in the 2023 elections. “We would like to emphatically state that this was not authored by His Highness, Khalifa Muhammad Sanusi II as is being widely attributed,” the statement read. He further clarified that the former Emir does not bear Sanusi Lamido Sanusi any longer; saying he is now referred to as ‘HH Muhammad Sanusi II.’ “We also take this opportunity to encourage readers to scrutinize the information they find online to identify false and misleading information purported to have come from eminent personalities and thought leaders,” he counselled. Similarly, our fact-checker observed that none of the social media users who posted the article disclosed their source(s) publicly, thus raising a red flag. Also, a keyword search on Google did not reveal anywhere or when the former Emir made the statement. Moreover, no credible media organisation in the country reported the article attributed to Sanusi. Further findings by The FactCheckHub traced the claim to a post made by Doyin Okupe, the former Special Assistant on Media and Publicity to a former Nigerian President, Olusegun Obasanjo. He attributed the article to an individual identified as Mohammed Sanusi but misconstrued it as written by the former Emir. Further checks led to a different article written in Hausa and published in Premium Times, clarifying that the Emir did not author the quote. The article, written in the Hausa language, was authored by Murtala Muhammad Gusau, the Chief Imam of Nagazi-Uvete Jumu’ah mosque in Kogi state. He is also a regular columnist on Premium Times. Part of the article translated using the Google Translate – a language translation platform – reads: “Dear brothers and sisters, as we wrote yesterday, we have spread the English language to attract the attention of the people, and today we are spreading the Hausa language. “As you know, there is an article by a man named Sanusi Mohammed or Mohammed Sanusi who writes on social media, criticising politicians, insulting and abusing other politicians, but some people, who have a purpose in life, and who do not know who the author is, spread the word, claiming that it was written by His Highness the Emir of Kano Khalifah Malam Muhammadu Sanusi II. “Therefore, we are trying to persuade the people to know that the attempt by some to link the writings of that man, Mohammed Sanusi, to the King is a great injustice. So, let’s be careful please! “We further draw the attention of the entire nation to the fact that the author of this article, Mohammed Sanusi, is not the Caliph of King Muhammad Sanusi II. It’s just a person, a social media guy doing this post. “And sadly, it is the writing of this man, Mohammed Sanusi, that you can see promoted by some great politicians to achieve their own ends! “As we have seen, Mr. Doyin Okupe is spreading this false text, even claiming that it is from the Caliph, which, by the way, is false, not true at all. So please, people, let’s be more careful.” The FactCheckHub also reached out to Murtala, the Islamic scholar. He was found to be a close associate of the Emir. He, however, confirmed that the former CBN governor did not write the article. “The article which is trending on social media was not written by him (Emir Sanusi), and that’s why we wrote and explained to people that they should stop displaying the article as an article written by him. “We even discussed seriously with the Emir Sanusi regarding one Mohammed Sanusi writing on social media and that people are mistakenly attributing it to him.”',\n",

      "0\t As of 5pm on Tuesday (March 21), INEC is yet to declare the winner of the gubernatorial election in Enugu state. A press statement released by the commission says collation has been suspended in the state. Vanguard, Thisday live, and Tribune online all reported the suspension of the collation. \n",
      "\n",
      "1\t According to Radio Nigeria’s report, INEC’s office in Obingwa Local Government of Abia state was attacked last Sunday. Some of its officials were held hostage in connection with the collation of results. The incident has prompted INEC’s review of the result. \n",
      "\n",
      "2\t The alleged statement is found to have been doctored and altered. Although Ms Oti made a statement before calling on her administrative secretary to read the INEC’s press release suspending the election, she never insinuated foul play, as stated in the viral post. A 13-minute-long video report by TVC contains her actual statement. The INEC chairman and her administrative secretary debunked the claims when the NFC contacted them. Rotimi Oyekanmi, Chief Press Secretary to INEC, has also issued a rebuttal debunking the claim. \n",
      "\n",
      "3\t From the NFC’s footage review, the police officers did not engage the INEC officers. Also, CODE observer Evelyn Williams, in Rivers state, confirmed to the NFC that thugs snatched ballot boxes in some local government wards in Obio-Akpor and PHALGA. Still, there were no reports of police officers’ involvement. \n",
      "\n",
      "4\t The report is based on a viral video, which shows Soludo discussing with a few people in Igbo language, standing in front of the Anambra State government House. The governor told a story claiming that Micheal Okpara, the premier of the Eastern Region in the First Republic, unearthed pipes his government laid in Inyi because the town did not vote for his party NCNC. Soludo concluded, “there must be a consequence, and there must be a reward.” \n",
      "\n",
      "5\t Using Google Earth, the NFC performed a geo-location on the video and discovered it was captured at Shadia Onanuga street, Abule-Ado, in Lagos state. \n",
      "\n",
      "6\t Based on the final list of House of Assembly contestants released by INEC and published by Premium Times, Mr Muhammad Adamu Oyanki, contesting under PDP, is 26 years old, not 23. As of 10 am today, INEC is yet to release the results of the Nasarawa state HOA elections. \n",
      "\n",
      "7\t In the video, protesters sang and prayed in Igbo, a language widely spoken in Enugu state, and they held posters of the Labour Party (LP) governorship candidate in Enugu, Chijioke Edeoga. Enugu-based journalists confirmed the incident saying they are LP supporters protesting due to allegations of manipulation of the governorship election results of two outstanding local government areas – Nsukka and Nkanu East. In response, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) announced the suspension of collation in those local government areas. \n",
      "\n",
      "8\t The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has suspended the collation of results in the state. The commission said the suspension was to review results from two outstanding LGAs of Nsukka and Nkanu East. \n",
      "\n",

A 13-minute-long video report by TVC contains her actual statement. The INEC chairman and her administrative secretary debunked the claims when the NFC contacted them.
