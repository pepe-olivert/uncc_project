CLAIM: INEC has uploaded National Assembly election results on the IReV portal but has yet to do so for presidential elections.,"Reactions worldwide have followed the February 25th  presidential election in Africa’s biggest democracy, which produced Bola Tinubu as Nigeria’s next leader. Mr Tinubu was the candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). Major opposition parties in the fiercely contested polls have refused to concede defeat, and the two closest contestants have formally challenged the results in court.  Mr Tinubu, 70, scored 8,794,726 votes, the highest of all the candidates. His closest rival, Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), scored 6,984,520 votes to emerge second in the election, while Labour Party’s Peter Obi got a total of 6,101,533. PDP’s Mr Atiku called the result “a rape of democracy” after getting 29 per cent of the vote, and Labour Party’s Mr Obi, who got 25 per cent, told supporters they had been “robbed” of victory and said the elections is “worst in Nigeria’s recent history.” The opposition parties are lamenting the inability of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to upload screenshots of polling station results to a central portal, IReV, created for the purpose.  INEC’s guideline for the election explicitly states that results from each of the more than 176,000 polling stations will be electronically transmitted to the commission’s collation system and also uploaded to its website. But that was not possible with INEC apologising for “technical glitches.” As Mr Obi and Mr Atiku continue their challenge of the presidential elections results for not being uploaded on IReV timely, they have ironically endorsed and celebrated some of the election results at the national legislative levels favourable to their parties. The Elections of the federal lawmakers were simultaneously held on the same day as the presidential election.  For instance, on 8 March, Mr Obi organised a dinner for the elected legislative members of the Labour Party. “This evening, I hosted the welcome dinner for Labour Party Senators and Members of the House of Representatives in Abuja,” he wrote on Twitter with pictures attached from the event. The senator-elect of the FCT, Ireti Kingibe, also posted: “The elected Senators and House of Representative members of our great party came together to dine and celebrate with each other in harmony. Thank you @PeterObi, for hosting us.” The Labour Party won 40 seats in the National Assembly, 6 Senates and 34 House of Representative positions. On the other hand, the PDP got 29 seats in the Senate and 102 in the House of Representatives. The APC won most of the seats, with 57 in the Senate and 162 in the House of Representatives. The results of the Senate and House of Representatives elections are expected to be uploaded and published on the IReV portal at the end of voting. Some public commentators have claimed that INEC has since uploaded the national legislative-level election results. In a widely circulated video, Emmanuel Ogebe, the Coordinator of Washington-based Democratic Election Monitoring Observers (DEMO), said: “Just to show you the extent of the mischief that occurred, the result of National Assembly elections which happened at the same time simultaneously with presidential elections results were able to be uploaded on IReV but the presidential election results were not uploaded. “Till this moment, the results have not been completely uploaded,” Mr Ogebe said at an event on 8 March in Washington. Then a Twitter user Daniel Okezue wrote: “I told you that @inecnigeria could not be trusted. I told you that elections are not rigged at PUs but at collation centres. Whatever makes you able to upload National Assembly results but couldn’t upload the presidential is the beginning of rigging. INEC has to answer for this.” One of Mr Obi’s special advisers, Valentine Ozigbo, wrote: “INEC officials uploaded the results of the National Assembly elections to the server without hitches.” But how true is the claim that INEC has uploaded the National Assembly elections results on IReV but has yet to do so for the presidential election? PREMIUM TIMES extracted data on the INEC portal on Monday, 27 March, and we discovered that out of 176,846, INEC has uploaded 166,656 polling unit results from presidential elections. This represents 94.24 per cent. The electoral commission is still expected to upload 10,190 polling units results. On the other hand, INEC has uploaded 150,281 polling units results for senatorial elections on the IReV portal, representing 84.97 per cent of the total.  As for the House of Representatives, the electoral commission has uploaded 152,055 polling units results from federal constituencies on IReV. This represents 85.98 per cent of the results. A review of the results by PREMIUM TIMES shows that as of Monday, 27 March, only 48 per cent of FCT senatorial elections results were published on IReV. INEC has published only 1,356 out of 2,822 polling unit results in the FCT senatorial district. Similarly, only 78 per cent of senatorial election results in Akwa Ibom South are uploaded on IReV. PDP’s Ekong Samson is the senator-elect of the Akwa Ibom Senatorial South district election. The electoral commission uploaded only 996 out of 1275 polling units results in the senatorial district. Then in Delta Central, INEC published 1399 out of 2180 polling units results of the senatorial elections. This represents 64.17 per cent of the final results that produced APC’s Ede Dafinone. Using official data from Nigeria’s electoral umpire, INEC, we found that out of 176,846, INEC has uploaded 166,656 polling unit results from presidential elections. This represents 94.24 per cent. On the other hand, INEC has published 150,281 (84.97 per cent) of the total results of senatorial elections and 152,055 (85.98 per cent) of the House of Representatives elections results uploaded on the IReV portal as of Monday, 27 March. Therefore it is false and misleading to say INEC has uploaded the results of national legislative elections but has yet to publish the presidential elections results. The data shows that INEC has uploaded and published more presidential election results on IReV than national assembly elections.

Claim: The bacteria in yoghurt is the same as the one in the vagina.,"Yoghurt, the creamy and tangy dairy delight, has been a staple in cuisines worldwide for centuries. Whether it’s enjoyed on its own, as a savoury dip, or as a refreshing topping for your favourite fruits and granola, yoghurt is a versatile and nutritious food that has something for everyone. Yoghurt is made by fermenting milk with live cultures of bacteria packed with probiotics that promote healthy digestion and boost the immune system. It’s also a great source of protein, calcium, and other essential vitamins and minerals.  People often wonder about two common types of bacteria found in yoghurt and those in the vagina. While both types of bacteria are important, are they the same? Recently on Twitter, in a post, temmie (@me_lanin_pie) asserted that the bacteria found in the vagina is the same in Yoghurt. The tweet reads, “The bacteria found in yoghurt is the same bacteria found in the vagina”. As of the time of filing this report, the tweet had a combination of retweets, likes, comments and views of over 742,000 engagements. DUBAWA thought it important to verify this because of the conflicting views about the bacteria found in yoghurt and the vagina, its virality and the sensitive nature of the issue concerning public health. According to an Oxford University Press on National Library publication, the word “yoghourt” is believed to have come from the Turkish word “yoğurmak,” which means to thicken, coagulate, or curdle. During references to the health-promoting properties of yoghurt date back to 6000 BC in Indian Ayurvedic scripts, it was not until the 20th century that Stamen Grigorov, a Bulgarian medical student, attributed the benefits to lactic acid bacteria.  Bacteria play an essential role in our bodies, and we encounter different types of bacteria in various parts of our bodies. Medical News Today defines bacteria as microscopic, single-celled organisms that exist in their millions, in every environment, both inside and outside other organisms. Some bacteria are harmful, but most serve a useful purpose. They support many forms of life, both plant and animal and are used in industrial and medicinal processes. Yoghurt is a fermented milk product made by adding specific strains of bacteria to milk. It is made when heated milk is combined with bacteria and left to sit at a warm temperature for several hours.  According to Simon Pedersen, a Food Scientist at Arla Foods, “When we add bacteria to milk products, we refer to them as cultures and use those with a good reputation. They are called lactic acid bacteria or lactic acid cultures.” These bacteria convert the lactose in milk into lactic acid, which causes the milk to thicken and develop its characteristic tangy taste. The two most common species of lactic acid bacteria used in yoghurt production are Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilous. On the other hand, the vagina contains a complex microbiome of different types of bacteria. The most dominant type of bacteria in a healthy vagina is the Lactobacillus species. These bacteria help maintain the vaginal pH, preventing the overgrowth of harmful bacteria that can lead to infections. The specific species of Lactobacillus present in the vagina include Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus iners, and Lactobacillus gasseri, among others. In 2015, Cecilia Westbrook, an MD/PhD student at the University of Wisconsin, made yoghurt using her vaginal bacteria. Rosanne Hertzberger, a Dutch microbiologist who studies vaginal bacteria at Washington University School of Medicine in the US, told ScienceAlert this was apparently not a good idea because our vaginas contain many of bad, as well as good, bacteria.  The dominant bacteria in the vagina is Lactobacillus, similar to the bacteria used to make yoghurt. However, not all Lactobacillus strains can create yoghurt, and the yoghurt we buy at supermarkets is made from a combination of different bacterial strains.  Ms Hertzberger replicated an experiment to make yoghurt using different Lactobacillus strains, but only one was remotely successful, producing sour milk with precipitated milk protein.  Gregor Reid, a professor of microbiology at the University of Western Ontario in Canada, also disagrees with the experiment by Ms Westbrook. According to Mr Reid, it is improbable that the experiment conducted by the woman resulted in any health benefits.  He said, “if she was eating it to get the benefits of the lactobacillus, she already has plenty in her vagina, so that makes no sense.” The bacteria used in yoghurt production are selected for their ability to ferment milk and create a specific taste and texture. According to a publication on Science Direct, the bacteria in the vagina are naturally occurring and play a vital role in maintaining the vaginal environment. One of the most significant differences between the bacteria in yoghurt and the vagina is their location. Yoghurt bacteria are primarily found in the digestive system, whereas vaginal bacteria are found in the reproductive system. Additionally, yoghurt bacteria are not a natural body part, whereas vaginal bacteria are. Another important difference is the role they play in the body. While yoghurt bacteria can help promote digestive health, vaginal bacteria are essential for reproductive health. A health expert, Omale Ogbe, in an interview with DUBAWA, stated that the bacterias are not the same based on the taxonomy.  “They may be of the same genus, but they are not the same specie as can be seen here for bacteria found in the vagina (Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus iners, Lactobacillus. jensenii, and Lactobacillus gasser) and here for yoghurt bacteria (Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus),” Mr Ogbe explained. While the bacteria found in yoghurt and the vagina may have some similarities, they are not the same. Yoghurt bacteria are selected for their ability to ferment milk and create a specific taste and texture, while vaginal bacteria are naturally occurring and play a vital role in maintaining reproductive health.

Claim: A viral WhatsApp message claims that the government of Dubai is giving out $110 as a Ramadan relief fund.,"Worldwide, Muslims start their annual fast period in the month of Ramadan. During this period, information continues to flood the internet. Amid their fast, Muslims are bound to have a special need to buy foodstuffs and carry out their faith in good health which requires funds.  Amid this, a message that the government of Dubai is sharing $110 as Ramadan Relief Funds, and every individual of all nationalities can apply. DUBAWA carried out a keyword search on the Dubai Ramadan relief fund mentioned in the message but did not find any. Our findings, however, showed different organisations and charities are giving out food to people during Ramadan. According to the Arab News, Dubai’s ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al-Maktoum, started a program to sustainably provide hundreds of millions of meals to those in need during Ramadan. We subjected the link to Whois.com to verify the website’s source, and we found that the website was created in Oyo state, Nigeria, not in Dubai. Another red flag is that people who visit the website can bypass the form on the page without filling out the “application form,” suggesting it is a malicious act. Another glaring red flag was the presence of fake testimonial statements. This is a common technique online con artists employ to entice prey into their cave. Despite not being clickable, the links to the alleged remarks still serve as a trickery tool for users. After clicking “submit” without inputting my details on the landing page, we came across messages that revealed the number of applicants is limited to 50,000. After submission, the website requests additional information from visitors before granting entry to the grant, as seen in the screenshot below; a trick commonly used by con artists to get people to visit their websites. Part of this additional information which is the request to share with groups and friends, explains why the message went viral on WhatsApp.  Our findings show that the Dubai government is not giving out Ramadan relief funds, and the message was shared with ill intent. Hence the claim is false. ",FALSE,03/04/2023,https://dubawa.org/dubai-government-not-giving-ramadan-relief-funds-as-claimed-in-viral-whatsapp-message/
"Claim: Pastor Enoch Adeboye, the General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), allegedly led a protest against former President Goodluck Jonathan in 2014.","On February 21, 2023, a Twitter user with the handle Bibi Baby Boy @escobless tweeted a photo showing Mr Adeboye with other men dressed in suits and paramilitary uniforms holding placards as a sign of protest. The Twitter user shared the image with a caption suggesting that the cleric was leading church members in a protest against Mr Jonathan in 2014. The tweet garnered over 3,000 retweets and over 7,224 likes and reads: “In 2014, RCCG led a march against Jonathan cos they wanted Buhari with the hope that Osinbajo will take over in 2023. Four days to the polls with one viable Christian on the ballot named Peter Obi they’re suddenly quiet. Pastor Paul Adefarasin is telling us to vote Saul. Frauds!!” Results from the search showed that the image was captured in 2020 during Mr Buhari’s administration. Findings revealed that the photo was from a peaceful protest, led by Mr Adeboye, against widespread killings in the country at the time, as seen here and here.  Meanwhile, according to a report by Vanguard Newspaper, Mr Adeboye had earlier in 2010 sent a petition to stage a one-million protest against the spate of insecurity in Nigeria. However, a  thorough online search shows that the protest did not hold. The viral photo was originally taken in 2020 during Mr Buhari’s administration – not in 2014 as claimed. Mr Adeboye did not lead a protest against Mr Jonathan in 2014. The photo was, therefore, shared in the wrong context to mislead people.

"Claim: “The purported letter from U.S Ambassador McCarthy accusing Liberians in the USA of spreading information is fake,” says activist Martin K.N. Kollie","Liberians residing in the United States who were noted for using the traditional media or radio stations back home to spew allegations were shocked after the US embassy openly debunked their actions. The US envoy in Liberia said most of the controversies emerging in Liberian media ahead of the elections originated from the United States. “Today, I am ashamed to tell you that the most irresponsible controversies to emerge in Liberia’s media over the past month have originated from the United States. While responsible critical observations from the Liberian diaspora can be healthy, some cowardly media personalities and political personalities have intentionally disseminated rumours or misinformation into Liberia’s political environment from the safety of their studios and offices in the U.S.,” Ambassador McCarthy said in his opening remarks with the anti-corruption coordinators. His statement comes on the heels of allegations by persons based in the US that City Mayor of Monrovia, Jefferson Koijee, masterminded the killing of former Chief Justice’s daughter, Charloe Musu, by sponsoring a City police officer, Varlee Telleh, who is an ex-fighter for former President Charles Taylor during Liberia’s civil crisis.  Liberian lawyer Jerome Verdier, currently residing in the US, made this particular allegation.  He was also the online guest panellist on the SpoonTalk show. The Mayor, who was accused of masterminding the murder, has, through his legal team, challenged Verdier to provide evidence to authenticate his claim to help the Police force with an ongoing investigation. Verdier is not the only person known for trading allegations and disinformation. Martin Kollie, who also resides in the diaspora but is vocal on local issues in Liberia, is known to have traded some false news as well, one of which was investigated by DUBAWA.  For example, his claim about the doctor to patients ratio in the country was found to be palpably false after DUBAWA ‘Fact-Checked the claim. Attached is the report. In discussing the issue raised by Liberia’s US Ambassador about disinformation from Liberians in the US, Martin Kollie sought to deny there was no such comment by the US Ambassador. He alleged the comment attributed to the US Ambassador was no more than pro-CDC propaganda being shared on Facebook. Kollie’s post, dated March 15, 2023, has generated over two hundred controversial comments, thirty-one shares and 292 Facebook likes and emojis. Though some Facebook commenters disagreed with the claimant under his post, others believed him. Given the mention of a prominent diplomat and the significance of the information to Liberia and its biting effects on the nation, DUBAWA decided to verify the post by activist Martin K.N. Kollie. Again, as a result of the controversy generated by Martin Kollie’s post, insisting the comment by the Ambassador was non-existent, DUBAWA had every responsibility to verify if the US Ambassador’s comment was indeed made.

"Claim: Nigeria’s Minister of Finance, Zainab Ahmed, recently claimed that the country’s 7.5% VAT rate is the lowest in the world.","As Nigeria struggles with a rising cost of governance and depleting revenue, the government continues to look for avenues to raise money. One such way is through Value Added Tax (VAT).  Recently, the country’s Minister of Finance, Hajia Zainab Ahmed, while paying a courtesy call on Nigeria’s international broadcasting station, Voice of Nigeria, argued that Nigeria should raise more revenue from VAT, by increasing the rate from 7.5% to 10%. To justify her stance, the minister stated, “VAT was one of the ways to increase revenue, and we still have to increase VAT because, at 7.5 per cent, Nigeria has the lowest VAT rate in the world, not in Africa, in the world.” VAT is a consumption tax added to the price of goods and services and paid when a good is purchased, or a service is rendered. The consumer carries the cost. Introduced in 1993 to replace the sales tax in Nigeria, VAT continues to take more space in its contribution to Nigeria’s revenue, reaching a whopping N1.2 trillion Naira in the first six months of 2022.  VAT is a major source of revenue for governments worldwide and requires businesses to keep detailed records of their sales and purchases. The minister’s position as a high-ranking government official, and with powers to make decisions with far-reaching consequences, informs DUBAWA’s fact-check. To verify the minister’s claim, DUBAWA first looked through “tax summaries,” an online tax portal run by one of the world’s leading financial consultancy companies, PricewaterhouseCoopers, PWC. The website holds an overview of up-to-date statutory VAT rates across different countries.  At least three countries –Thailand, United Arab Emirates, and Oman– on the portal have VAT rates lower than the 7.5% of Nigeria as of 2023. To confirm that the information on the portal is accurate, DUBAWA dug deeper into state-owned websites. On the website of Thailand’s revenue department, the VAT rate for the country is listed as 7%. Also, information on the website of the UAE’s Ministry of Finance says VAT, which was introduced in the country in 2018, is charged at the rate of  5%. In addition, chapter 5, article 36 of Oman’s VAT law, available on the Tax Authority website, fixes the country’s VAT at 5%, lower than Nigeria’s 7.5% VAT rate.  Findings by DUBAWA and as available on the websites of three other countries show that Oman (5%), Thailand (7%), and the UAE (5%) have VAT rates lower than Nigeria’s 7.5% charge.

"Claim: Chris Ngige advised APC not to celebrate the presidential election victory, drawing from his legal experience with Peter Obi.","One such claim is the Twitter post by Gabriel Chima (@gabrielchimam) on March 21, 2023. In this tweet, Mr Chima claimed that the Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige, said he had told the APC not to celebrate the presidential election yet, drawing from his experience with Peter Obi in court.  The Twitter account used an image of Mr Ngige answering questions from journalists to support the tweet.  “I told APC not to celebrate the presidential election yet because only me knew what I saw in Peter Obi’s hands during our court case,” the quote reads. Recall that after INEC declared Mr Ngige of PDP as governor-elect in the April 19, 2003 governorship election in Anambra State, Mr Obi, who contested the election under All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA), went to court to challenge the result.  He got his mandate back on March 17, 2006, following the Appeal Court ruling that Mr Obi was the rightful winner of the April 19, 2003 election. A detail of this account and the long judicial battle embarked upon by Peter Obi in Anambra State can be found in this publication by Premium Times.  As of March 22, 2023, @gabrielchimam’s tweet had gathered over 3,000 engagements, including views, likes, retweets and comments.  However, Twitter users in the comment section expressed disbelief. Twitter users’ suspicion of the tweet and the post’s virality prompted DUBAWA to verify it.  We conducted a keyword search to discover if the claim was reported on credible news platforms. We also searched for the alleged quote in recent news, but there was none.  We further discovered that Mr Ngige does not have a Twitter or Facebook. account.  DUBAWA then contacted the minister’s spokesperson, Emmanuel Nzomiwu, via WhatsApp, who debunked the claim. Mr Nsomiwu also confirmed via phone that Mr Ngige is not active on social media.  “Fake news. Disregard it, please. Thanks for reaching out,” Mr Nzomiwu said.

"CLAIM: The President of Sierra Leone, Julius Maada Bio, has commissioned a brand New Freetown International Airport in Sierra Leone.","The Freetown International Airport has been a trending topic of discussion lately. This is owing to arguments around the newly commissioned facility in the Lungi airport by President Julius Maada Bio on Friday, March 3, 2023. While some say the facility is a ‘brand new’ airport, others believe it is an ‘extension’ of the existing one. Since the commissioning of the facility, some critics, including a Social Media Influencer, Joe Hanson, argued that the president commissioned a new terminal extension at the already existing Freetown International Airport, which contradicts the stand of supporters and government officials of the Sierra Leone People’s Party hailing construction of a new airport.  A member of the Strategic Communications Units at the Ministry of Information and Communications, Peter Beckley, also shared on a Facebook post that the new facility is an airport. He said in his post, “I witnessed the opening of the new Ultra modern Airport on Friday, March 3, 2023, which was an experience close to hysteria.” Given the controversy, this story has generated in Sierra Leone over the last couple of weeks and the need to set the records straight on the matter, DUBAWA decided to investigate the matter. DUBAWA sought to discover whether or not the edifice was a completely new one or an old one that had undergone a significant facelift.  On Wednesday, December 16, 2020, the Parliament of Sierra Leone debated and ratified the Lungi Freetown International Airport expansion project agreement between the government of Sierra Leone and the Russian-owned Summa Airports Limited. In his statement while presenting the agreement in parliament prior to ratification, the Deputy Minister of Transport and Aviation, Sadiq Sillah, said that the Freetown International Airport project would focus mainly on the construction of a new passenger terminal that will cater for three million passengers, construction of a VIP/presidential lounge, resealing of the runway, construction of the taxiway, a new airport traffic terminal, search and rescue fire force unit, rehabilitation of the car park and road safety and its signs. On Thursday, November 12, 2020,  the President,  Dr Julius Maada Bio, turned the sod for what State House described as, “the commencement of a $270 million work on the new airport terminal project that will accommodate one million passengers per year and provide 2000 direct jobs for Sierra Leoneans in the construction phase.” The Country Director of the SUMMA Group in Sierra Leone, Ibrahim Sheriff, said, “They were a multinational Turkish company operating in about  eight African countries, adding that they are building a new terminal that would create the transformation of a new airport in Lungi.”  In his keynote address, while launching the project, Dr Julius Maada Bio said, “They will build a brand new airport terminal, Presidential and VIP lounge – with ultra-modern equipment. The airport, he said, would accommodate at least eight large aircraft, adding that after its completion, Sierra Leone will have a brand new airport – a modern, safe, and state-of-the-art international airport reflective of the New Direction Government.” Contrary to what some Sierra Leone People’s Party party supporters and senior government ministers have been saying, President Bio, during the commissioning, cleared the air. He announced that the project is not a newly built airport, but a new passenger terminal: A new arrival and departure terminal built adjacent to the existing Lungi Freetown International Airport. This can be found on page six of his remarks at the Formal Commissioning of the New Freetown International Airport Terminal and Facilities on March 3, 2023. President Bio, in his statement, said that they had undertaken this investment because they believe it promotes job creation, boosts new growth sectors (tourism),  supports international trade, and attracts new investment streams in other sectors.  The president, on page number 6 of his statement, asked; c. a new Air Traffic Control Tower with ultramodern equipment, ICT infrastructure, and radiotelephony;  d. a new parallel taxiway that connects to the existing runway, with connecting bridges;  h. A 1.5 MW solar farm that supplies green energy to the new airport facility. This is unique in the region.  Further, a tweet shared by Mr Bio on his Twitter page also dispels the suppositions that the new infrastructure is a new airport. The president said, “04/03/2023 was a momentous day for our great nation #SierraLeone. As part of my SLPP Government’s efforts to transform the infrastructural landscape, I opened the new state-of-the-art Freetown International Airport Terminal Building & supporting infrastructure in Lungi, Port Loko.” President Julius Maada Bio, on Friday, March 3, 2023, didn’t commission a ‘brand new’ airport but a new terminal for the existing airport. The project since inception was to expand Lungi airport to include a new and larger terminal and relaying of the runway to accommodate larger and more airlines, in keeping with international standards.

"Claim: The family of Justice Gloria Musu-Scott, in a recent statement, quotes the ruling party Chairman Mulbah Morlu as saying, “their daughter Charloe Musu was killed for ritualistic purposes.”","The murder and armed robbery attacks on the home of Liberia’s former Chief Justice, Gloria Musu-Scott, have been greeted with several accusations, one of which is coming from the family of Justice Scott. Charloe Musu, daughter of Justice Scott, was murdered on the morning of Thursday,  February 23, 2023, at Justice Scott’s residence in Brewville on the outskirt of the city. Other members of the household suffered injuries in the attack. It is not yet clear the motive for the murder and the attack but the news of the murder has since gone viral.   The police have since begun an investigation into the matter. While citizens look forward to a speedy investigation and the arrest of the culprits, there have been some allegations and counter-allegations. One such is from the family of the former Chief Justice.  On March 6, 2023, the family issued a statement accusing the ruling party chairman, Mulbah Morlu, of making statements against the family. The statement partly reads, “On Thursday, March 2, 2023, the chairman of the ruling Coalition for Democratic Change – CDC, Mulbah Morlu, had a Press Conference at the CDC headquarters in Sinkor. It was held immediately after the Liberian Women Sit-in Action in protest at the Legislature on Capitol Hill seat against the murder and assault against the Musu family.” The family statement accused Mr Morlu of saying Charloe was killed for “ritualistic purposes.” The murder of Charloe has triggered widespread, vehement public condemnation in the country.  The institutions and groups that have expressed disdain over the attacks include the Liberia National Bar Association, former Vice President and Standard bearer of the former ruling Unity Party, Joseph Nyuma Boakai. The gravity of the situation involving former Chief Justice Gloria Musu Scott and her daughter’s death and the accusation against the party chairman form the basis for this fact-check. Given the sensitive nature of the claim, DUBAWA decided to contact the family for evidence of its claim against the party chairman. But the family of the former Chief Justice, when contacted for a response, declined to verify the claim as indicated in their Press statement. The Family spokesperson Julius Musu in a telephone conversation with this researcher, said the family would not respond to the inquiry seeking answers over an allegation raised in their most recent release. “All I can tell you is that the matter is before the police, and the family is cooperating, and that is all for now,” Julius Musu said on the phone.

Claim: A Twitter user alleged that a 19-year-old boy committed suicide by hanging due to Peter Obi losing the presidential election to Bola Tinubu.,"A suicide photo of a young man has surfaced on social media with a rather tragic narrative. Peter obi’s Kidney (@Dalapflourish) tweeted the picture alleging that the boy committed suicide because Peter Obi lost the just concluded 2023 presidential polls to Bola Tinubu.  The Twitter user, implicitly eulogised the death of the alleged boy, citing the reason for the demise of Nigeria’s future hopelessness as Mr Obi lost the election.  “*SAD NEWS:” He tweeted, “I will tell God INEC killed me. A young boy from Plateau state commits suicide and dies after Obi loses a rigged election. The 19-year-old boy left a short note behind which reads – no hope for Nigeria for the next 20 years after Obi lost the election.”  The tweet generated diverse opinions on the platform. For instance, (@Mrbalance13), who believes the claim valid, expressed sadness over the scenario. “Sad news,” he wrote. Another Twitter user, Bernard Clifford Asoka (@AsikaClifford), replied, “Lord have mercy.” Some people, however, referred to the information as false. Samsonyte (@ogbebor_samson) was one of them. He said, “this is not true, please.”  As of this report’s filing, the tweet has been viewed 8,947 times and garnered 70 likes, 58 retweets, and ten quote retweets.  The sensitivity of the claim and its potential to go viral and mislead people is why DUBAWA is fact-checking it to set the records straight.  DUBAWA first ran a Google reverse image search on the alleged image to discover where else it has appeared online and with what narrative. The results from the search traced the earliest appearance of the image back to 2016.  An online blog, Talk Glitz Media, on December 26, 2016, ran a story with the alleged picture alongside the headline “Yahoo Boy Commits Suicide In Warri.” Another platform, Urhobo Today, on December 26, 2016, ran a similar story with the headline “Yahoo, Yahoo Boy Commits Suicide In Warri” with the same picture.   While DUBAWA cannot ascertain the veracity and truth in the report these blogs share, it has been established that the image has been available online since 2016. The Plateau State (the alleged location) Police department had also debunked the news of anyone committing suicide related to the presidential elections. DSP Alabi Alfred, the Police Public Relations Officer in the state, told journalists that the claim is false and unfounded and capable of inciting violence within the state. “To ascertain the post’s veracity, the command contacted all its divisional headquarters in the state, but no case of such nature was reported to any police area command/divisional headquarters, outpost or formation in the state,” the PRO confirmed.

Claim: The viral bloodied image of Labour Party House of Assembly candidate Olumide Oworu is from the attack on his campaign council.,"Claim: The viral bloodied image of Labour Party House of Assembly candidate Olumide Oworu is from the attack on his campaign council.  Verdict: MISLEADING. Our findings show the bloodied image of Mr Oworu is from a movie shoot. It is not due to an attack on his campaign team. Less than 48 hours to the Lagos state governorship and House of Assembly election, a bloodied image of Olumide Oworu, the Labour Party’s candidate for Lagos State House of Assembly in Surulere Constituency 1, went viral.  Thugs reportedly attacked Mr Oworu and his supporters on Thursday, March 16, 2023, Channels TV reported. The image circulating online after the alleged attack shows Mr Oworu’s face and shirt covered with blood with the claim that thugs hired by the All Progressives Congress (APC) bruised him during an ambush. A Twitter user, @omolerinjare, tweeted the photo with an allegation that Desmond Elliot orchestrated the attack. Another Twitter user, @ayemojuba tweeted the photo with another caption, “Olumide Oworu was attacked by APC thugs.” The virality and sensitive nature of the claim on the heel of the state election called for verification.  A check by The FactCheckHub shows that the image has been online for over five months. Mr Oworu,  a Nigerian actor featured in several Nollywood movies and who won many awards for his diverse roles, uploaded the image on his Instagram handle with a caption indicating it is from a movie production. He shared the photo on October 3, 2022, with the caption, “Alagbado John Wick. #OntheEdge on his Instagram page.” Similarly, the claim that APC thugs attacked him could not be independently verified as of this report’s filing. Our findings reveal that the bloodied image of Mr Oworu is from a movie shoot. This report was written by FactCheckHub and republished by DUBAWA as part of the Nigerian Fact-checkers’ Coalition initiative. See the original piece here.

"Claim: The APC Women Leader, Dr Betta Edu, in a recent interview, claims that the Labour Party has no governorship candidate in Cross River State. She added that her party had won all House Representatives seats in the state except in the Northern Senatorial District.","In a recent interview on Arise TV, a former commissioner of health in Cross River state and the current National  Women Leader of the ruling All Progressive Congress, APC made various claims regarding the recent elections. Speaking about the national parliamentary elections, Ms Edu said: “I want to put this to the fore that APC won the House of Representative seats except that of the Northern part of the state. So, APC won in the central, APC won in the south, and we only lost in the Northern part of the state.”  On the state governorship elections, she said: “The Labour Party won [the presidential election in the state], APC came close second, and then PDP came far third. Going into the next election, Labour Party doesn’t have a candidate.” Ms Betta added, “for PDP, we are not worried about them. They are not a threat to us. We are discussing with them and working hand in hand with them because they do not even have a governorship candidate. They will work with us in APC.”  In verifying the claim that the APC swept all the House of Representatives seats in the central and southern part of the state, DUBAWA looked through the list of members-elect of the House of Representatives shared by the Independent National Electoral Commission.  On the list published by INEC, of the eight seats, PDP won the two available slots in the Northern Senatorial District. APC won all three available seats in the Central Senatorial District, while the APC took two seats and LP one seat in the Southern Senatorial District. Under the column for Cross River State and number 81 on the overall list, Akiba Bassey Ekpenyong of the Labour Party is listed as the winner of the Calabar Municipality/Odukpani Federal Representative Seat.  While INEC has yet to upload a comprehensive list of governorship candidates, information from credible media houses such as Vanguard and Daily Post show that Mr Ogar Osim is the Labour Party’s candidate for the governorship seat in the State alongside Ekpezu Obu as his running mate.  Following claims made by the APC in Cross River that the party was working hand-in-glove with the Labour Party, the State Publicity Secretary of the Labour Party, Dr Lekan Ofem, denied the existence of such arrangement, insisting that the party “has a Governorship Candidate in the person of Patriarch Ogar Osim who is in the race to victory.”  Claims by Ms Edu that the APC had won all the available House of Representatives seats in the Central and Southern part of Cross River State in last month’s elections are misleading, as the party lost the Calabar Municipality/Odukpani seat to Bassey Akiba of LP.  Also, the claim that the Labour Party has no governorship candidate in this Saturday’s polls is false, as Mr Osim is flying the LP’s flag in the elections.

"Claim: Nigerian professor and Dan David Prize winner, Saheed Aderinto, requested Peter Obi’s mandate from the president-elect, Tinubu.","Nigerian creatives typically perform well in global scenes like Saheed Aderinto, a Professor of African history and African diaspora studies at the Florida International University, recently did.   On February 28, 2023, he went on his Facebook account to announce his clinching of the prestigious Dan David prize of $300,000, equivalent to N220 million. Mr Aderinto is the first Nigerian to win the award.  Soon after, his achievement attracted the attention of social media users, including the Chairperson Diaspora Commission, Abike Dabiri-Erewa (@abikedabiri), who celebrated Mr Aderinto on Twitter. Congratulatory messages from prominent Nigerians and the international community soon followed this.  Amongst the congratulatory messages were those of Peter Obi and President-elect Bola Tinubu. In the messages sent by Mr Obi and Mr Tinubu, they praised Mr Aderinto for clinching the $300,000 prize, making Africans proud. To ridicule Tinubu and project Obi, a parody Twitter user named “Saheed Aderinto (@Aderinto0)” quoted the congratulatory messages of Mr Obi and Mr Tinubu.  The parody account retweeted Obi’s congratulatory message addressing him as his President-elect while he urged Tinubu to allow the mandate of the people to prevail. He retweeted Tinubu’s congratulatory post on March 13, 2023, while that of Obi was retweeted a day earlier, on March 12, 2023.  As of March 14, 2023, the post on Tinubu had been retweeted over 13,000 with over 27,000 likes, while Obi has over  23,000 likes and 5,665 retweets. In the comments section for the retweet of Obi’s post,  some users became cynical about the credibility of Mr Aderinto. A Twitter handle @FabunmiAdeyemi wrote, “I am very sure that you will not win this award if you write like this, someone that came third in an election is your own President-elect. Anyway, I celebrate with you and congratulate you on the award.” Another Twitter user, Mouthpies @amhussle, wrote, “Prof can’t afford blue tick yet won $300,000.” We also discovered the claim was trending on Facebook. Our search showed that the posts had been trending as over 2,000 engagements as of March 14, 2023.  The post was also spotted on WhatsApp groups, TikTok and YouTube. At the moment, Nigerians are still divided over the outcome of the presidential election as opposition parties have begun challenging the result. Therefore, considering the virality of the post and the consequences of the claims, DUBAWA deemed it necessary to verify. A quick search of the name Saheed Aderinto on Twitter showed various mentions. DUBAWA navigated to the account name Saheed Aderinto writing under (@Aderinto0). The account opened in  2019 has 3,193 tweets with 8,180 followers. As of 10:25, March 14, 2023, the said account, with the username @Aderinto0 had changed to @ParodyElluP, still with the name Saheed Aderinto. However, by 11:38 am of the same day, it had changed its username to @ElluP01 with the name changed to Saheed Aderinto Parody.  However, in the comments session, his initial handle, @Aderinto0, still reflected as people mentioned him. These moves were observed by some Twitter users, while others tried to excuse his actions.  Another user @AderonkeW pointed out that the account is fake while sharing a screenshot of Aderinto’s Facebook post denouncing the Twitter handle. She alleged the person behind the parody account is one Iteola Akinpelu Oladele, calling on security operatives @OfficialDSSG to wade into the matter. Reacting to the several comments calling him out, the person responded that nobody cares if the account is a parody. He wrote, “They said it’s a parody account. Who cares?? Pls Return that stolen Mandate ASAP.” He tweeted a follow-up taunting the people calling him out and challenging them to go to court. “They said my name is not Saheed Aderinto. If you are not satisfied with it, Go to Court!!!” he wrote. He subsequently made another tweet, confirming his account to be a parody. A check on Aderinto’s Facebook page showed that he knows the Twitter post and has disassociated himself from the account. He also did the same on LinkedIn. Further checks revealed that Aderinto posted his receipt of the prize on February 28, 2023, and also reacted to President Muhammadu Buhari’s message. DUBAWA discovered that the Twitter account which made the controversial tweet is a parody. Mr Aderinto has also clarified that he does not have a Twitter page. Hence, the claim is false.

Claim: A throwback photo attributed to Tinubu and current Nigeria’s Chief Justice has gone viral on Twitter.,"Claim: A throwback photo attributed to Tinubu and current Nigeria’s Chief Justice has gone viral on Twitter. Verdict: FALSE. The image is that of Bola Tinubu and Dele Momodu from 1996.  Following the emergence of Bola Tinubu as the February 25 Presidential election winner, the opposition parties have expressed dissatisfaction with the election and collation process by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and Labour Party have refused to concede defeat. They have subsequently gone to court to request access to sensitive materials deployed by INEC for the presidential election. A supporter of the Labour Party, Obident Nature (@Naturenwa), doubts the credibility of the court procedure. Questioning the court’s integrity, @Naturenwa, in a now-deleted tweet, shared a picture of Tinubu and a man he claimed to be the current Chief Judge of the Federation, Olukayode Ariwoola.  “Tinubu and current Chief Judge of FRN,” the tweet caption reads. Before the tweet was taken down, it had garnered 242,000 views, 63 likes, 38 retweets and 325 quote retweets. The picture has also gone viral on WhatsApp with different narratives.  DUBAWA decided to investigate the claim due to its virality and the sensitivity of the issues surrounding the 2023 Presidential election. We deeply analysed the picture using the Invid photo debunker application. We discovered it was an old picture of Tinubu with Dele Momodu, a Nigerian Journalist, in 1996 while in London. We also manually searched Mr Momodu’s Twitter (@DeleMomodu) feed and found that he posted the picture on March 4, 2021.  We also compared the image of Mr Momodu and Mr Ariwoola and saw no similarity.  The alleged throwback image of Mr Tinubu and the Chief Judge is that of Mr Tinubu and Mr Momodu. The claim is, therefore, false. ",Verdict,15/03/2023,https://dubawa.org/dele-momodu-not-nigerias-chief-justice-olukayode-ariwoola-was-standing-next-to-tinubu-in-viral-throwback-photo/
"Claim:  Viral news articles published by “The Indiana Express, Dhaka Tribune” stated that the Bangladesh language named: ‘Bengali/Bangla’ was announced as the official language of Sierra Leone in 2002 by late former President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah.","Two popular news outlets in Asia, namely, The Indiana Express, an Indian-based media house and Dhaka Tribune, a Bangladesh-based media organisation, on varied dates — February 23, 2017 (Dhaka Tribune) and February 21, 2017 (Indiana Express) have published an article with a similar statement. The media houses in their publications noted that the Bangladesh language called ‘Bengali / Bangla’ was declared an ‘official language’ to be used by Sierra Leoneans by the late former president of the small West African nation — Dr Alhaji Ahmad Tejan Kabbah (of blessed memory).  “Soon after peace was restored in 2002, the country’s president Ahmad Tejan Kabbah announced that Bengali would henceforth be considered an official language of the Republic of Sierra Leone in recognition of the work done by Bangladeshi troops in restoring peace to the region. “We might reflect upon the example set by Sierra Leone to understand that celebrating languages from different countries goes a long way in building a strong bond among global powers,” — Indiana Express further indicated.   The bilateral relationship between Sierra Leone and Bangladesh has been long and cordial. Bangladesh has not only helped Sierra Leone to defeat its rebels. Still, it has equally made some huge social, economic, and infrastructural developments which the country is enjoying even to this present period. Bangladesh made its way into the heart of Sierra Leone and its people when the Asian nation committed itself to be part of the United Nations Peacekeeping Forces that helped to redeem the country from the hands of the rebels who invaded the country in 1992, stating further that, Bangladesh provided one of, if not, the largest contingent of military personnel to help Sierra Leone’s military to curb the civil conflict.  The 11-year civil war left the country’s economy and infrastructure with shattered hope of rekindling. The conflict took away thousands of precious lives, and properties worth millions of leones were destroyed.  DUBAWA’s research discovered that Bangladesh had not only helped to redeem Sierra Leone from the civil conflict but has also made immense contributions in the business and NGO worlds in Sierra Leone, as evidenced here and here.  The issue of Bengali being an official language in Sierra Leone had engaged the minds and attention of researchers in Bangladesh. One of them, Sayeem Hassan, Head Researcher, Rumor Scanner — a fact-finding organisation based in Bangladesh, contacted DUBAWA to investigate the viral claim made in the referenced publications.  He added that he had yearned for a while now to ascertain if Bengali is used as the official language in the far-way West African nation once colonised by England.  Hassan told DUBAWA that many citizens in Bangladesh believe that ‘Bengali is used as Sierra Leone’s official language’. It is for this reason that DUBAWA decided to investigate this claim.  The claims made in viral publications by the three Asian media houses have been made for over a decade, with no real evidence to support the same.  The small British colonised nation has numerous languages. However, none of these numerous languages is used as the country’s ‘official language’; instead, the language of the nation’s colonial masters, which is ‘English Language,’ is the officially recognised and/or accepted language used in all formal gatherings within the borders of Sierra Leone.  DUBAWA’s desktop research results show that the official language of Sierra Leone is “The English Language.”   According to the World Atlas, Sierra Leone’s official language is ‘English language’ – a language left behind by the country’s colonial fathers is predominantly spoken in formal functions and/or settings, which include: schools, government institutions, the Court of law, and the media.  There is no data nor proof to ascertain that late president Kabbah ever made such a statement or declaration for ‘Bengali/Bangla’ to be used as the official language of the former British colony.  The Institute for Sierra Leonean Languages (TISLL) is based in Freetown and educates citizens and foreigners who wish to acquire more in-depth knowledge of the country’s various languages. It also serves as a resource centre for research purposes concerning spoken languages in Sierra Leone.  DUBAWA contacted the Program Director — Mr Lamin H. Kargbo of The Institute for Sierra Leonean Languages (TISLL), to know if Bengali/Bangla is Sierra Leone’s official language. The Director refutes the claim, adding that ‘Bengali/Bangla’ has never been used nor announced as Sierra Leone’s official language.  Asked if the late former president ever declared or announced that Bengali would be used as an official language in the country, Kargbo noted that — all that he is aware of is that the late president did mention that ‘Bengali’ would be considered or included as a language of Sierra Leone, but not as an official language, he added.  DUBAWA probed why the late former president could make such a statement when Bengali has never been part of the numerous languages spoken in the small West African nation; the expert reliably said that the late president made the said statement to commend Bangladesh Government and its people for the great contributions and support rendered to Sierra Leone during the country’s civil war, which commenced in 1991 and ended in 2002 “Bengali was never declared as an official language of Sierra Leone. However, late president Kabbah in one of his numerous statements after the war, mentioned that Bengali would be considered and/or included as a part of Sierra Leone’s languages.    “The late president made the statement due to Bangladesh’s immense contributions to putting the senseless 11-year civil conflict in the country to an end. Ironically, since the announcement was made, Bengali has not even been recognised as a language by Sierra Leoneans, nor has it been spoken as a language in any part of Sierra Leone,” he narrated.  He noted further that the country has only one official language — the ‘English language’, stating that, other than English, all other languages in the country are only used for informal communication in places such as homes, mosques, churches, villages etc.  Ms Sia Tengbeh, a teacher of over 25 years, also told DUBAWA that in her over 25 years of a teaching career, she is unaware of a point in time any president or authority of any sort announced that the country’s official language would be changed. She averred that Sierra Leone’s official language has always been the  English language.   Despite Sierra Leone’s small geographical location and its 6.5 to 7 million population, according to the 2021 Mid-Term Housing & Population Census conducted by Statistics Sierra Leone (Stats-SL), the country can boast approximately 16 national languages/ethnic groups spoken predominantly in different areas nationwide.  National languages spoken in Sierra Leone and by Sierra Leoneans includes the following: Temne, Mende, Krio, Kissi, Fulla, Soso, Yalunka, Kono, Limba, Sherbro, Loko, and Madingo; these languages are only used in informal settings, such as — homes, in the streets, religious gatherings, and in a host of other non-formal settings.  Each of these languages has locations/areas where Sierra Leoneans residing in those places predominantly speak either one or two of the mentioned languages. According to Family Search’s recent data on Sierra Leonean Languages, ‘Temne & Mende’ constitute the lion’s number of speakers in the country, with ‘Temne’ speakers constituting  37% of the country’s population, and it is predominantly spoken in the Northern province; while speakers of ‘Mende’ constitutes 31%, and it is mainly spoken in the Southern & Eastern provinces of Sierra Leone. Bangladesh played a significant role in bringing peace to Sierra Leone during the 11-year civil conflict. However, it is false that Bengali, the language of the people of Bangladesh, was announced and/or adopted as Sierra Leone’s official language.

Claim: “Viral image of a lady smoking hookah is the deputy governorship candidate of the Labour Party in Lagos.”,"As the rescheduled governorship election in Lagos state and other states draw nearer, campaigns and counter-campaigns have intensified, heating the polity. Recently, an image of a lady smoking hookah went viral with the claim she is the running mate of Gbadebo Rhodes-Vivour, the governorship candidate of the Labour Party (LP) in Lagos state. The LP deputy governorship candidate for Lagos state is Princess Abiodun Oyefusi, whose running mate  described as a “super capable running mate.” Oyefusi (@PrincessOyefus1) was a former Lagos East Senatorial District candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in 2019. On Monday, March 13, 2023, Twitter user Ayekooto (@DeeOneAyekooto) suggested that the lady in the image was the deputy governorship candidate of LP.  “See the deputy governorship candidate of a certain political party in Lagos,” the tweet reads.  The post has garnered over one million views, 8,721 likes, 1,130 retweets, and 253 quote tweets as of Monday, March 13, 2023. Many Twitter users also posted the image with similar captions. The image with the same narrative has also made it to Facebook. It was shared by Tunde Salam, who said “Lobatan,” meaning “it is finished” because the LP deputy governorship candidate was allegedly smoking. “The Lagos State Deputy Governor under Labour Party- Princess Islamiyat Oyefusi,” the Facebook post reads. Lobatan!” An advanced image search by Google also led to an article by Momedia with the headline “Don’t just vote, do your research – reactions as Kemi Olulonyo shares rare photos of Labour Party deputy governorship candidate of Lagos state”. The article referenced an Instagram post by controversial journalist Kemi Olulonyo with the same picture and claim.   A Twitter user Nkechi2Lagos (@NkechiofLagos2), who appeared to believe Oyefusi was the one in the image, criticised the act of trying to discredit a candidate due to smoking. What she described as an “irrelevant case”. Reacting to the viral image, a Twitter user Persian Queen (@teeana_world), questioned the claim’s authenticity.  The virality of the image and the significance of this claim to voters’ perception prompted us to verify.  Although DUBAWA could not identify the photo’s origin, it appeared it had been used earlier on social media platforms with different narratives. From the allegation that the image is the deputy governorship candidate of LP to the narrative that it depicts the “next-generation of mothers,” social media users use it with various captions to share their biases. A Twitter user H.O.D Vawulence Dept for PO (@festiveplug), shared the image on March 10, 2023, tagging it “next generation mothers.” A keyword search on Facebook further led to an earlier version of the image shared on March 7, 2023, alongside a tray of food by Ojong Agbor, attributing the person in the image to a certain Amaka. Oyefusi addressed the viral image in a post on her official Twitter account, clarifying that the lady in the picture is not her. She tagged the narrative as propaganda. The General Secretary of the LP, Lagos State, Sam Okpala, in a phone interview with DUBAWA’s researcher, stated the claim is untrue and attributed it to the handwork of detractors. “Our deputy governorship candidate is a respected Princess in Lagos, and she does not smoke,” he said. Aside from the alleged picture of the lady smoking hookah has appeared on several social media platforms with different narratives, a comparative analysis of the said picture with another photo of the LP candidate on Forensically highlights apparent differences.  The upper finger knuckles of the LP candidate (left) are smoother and less dark than the smoking lady. Additionally, the LP candidate has slimmer and longer fingernails than in the alleged picture.  A comparative analysis of the nose features shows Oyefusi has a somewhat protruding nose than the one in the alleged picture. While the smoking lady appears flat and more open, that of the LP candidate is more pointy and enclosed. Our findings show that the Labour Party deputy governorship candidate, Abiodun Oyefusi is not the woman in the hookah-smoking picture. The claim is false.

Claim: Fasting can be used in the treatment of cancer.,"According to the World Health Organization (WHO), cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for ten million deaths in 2020. Simply put, nearly one in every six deaths is caused by cancer.  The most common cancers are breast, lung, colon and rectum and prostate cancers. A cause of death of this magnitude is a serious concern for the patient and close ones and society at large. This concern, in many cases, has led to serious research in the medical field with corresponding useful findings. You can find some of these breakthroughs here, here, and here.  Amid these many innovations and findings is the claim that fasting can be used to treat the dreaded health condition. A Twitter account LivertySavage (@AxelSavage4), wrote, “… fasting is one of the cures for cancer that the establishment does not want you to know about.” Another Twitter user Axel (@LibertySavage01), wrote, “Fact: Fasting cures cancer.   Another user SBitcoinHoarder (@BHoarder1), also asserted that this is a fact doctors won’t tell the public because they are not provided with this information. He also insinuated that pharmaceutical companies control this narrative.  Combined engagement on these tweets is over 2,798. While some users believed the claim to be true, others did not. For example, a comment on @BHoarder1’s tweet noted this was untrue.  Based on these mixed engagements, DUBAWA fact-checked this claim to ascertain its veracity and set the record straight.   DUBAWA investigated a quoted YouTube video by one of the claimants, @BHoarder1. The video is a 2019 presentation by Pradip Jamnadas (Medical Doctor), where he made a biochemistry case for fasting. According to his presentation, one of the benefits of fasting is that it helps kill cancer cells. He mentioned this between 34 minutes to 36 minutes of the video.  The National Library of Medicine US published on PubMed.gov in October 2022 titled Effect of fasting on cancer: A narrative review of scientific evidence.  The report states, “emerging evidence suggests that fasting could play a key role in cancer treatment by fostering conditions that limit cancer cells’ adaptability, survival, and growth. It added that fasting could increase the effectiveness of cancer treatments and limit adverse events.” However, it says it is difficult to establish a link between fasting and the prevention and treatment of cancer.  The report, therefore, recommended a combination of prolonged periodic fasting with a standard conventional therapeutic approach to promote cancer-free survival and treatment efficacy and reduce side effects in cancer patients. An article by Healthline.com says recent animal studies and a few preliminary human trials have shown a decrease in risk for cancer or a reduction in cancer growth rates. It states the result may be due to the following effects from fasting: decreased blood glucose production, stem cells triggered to regenerate the immune system, balanced nutritional intake, or increased production of tumour-killing cells. Another article by Medicalnewstoday.com wrote that some research suggests that fasting helps fight cancer by lowering insulin resistance and levels of inflammation. Fasting may also reverse the effects of chronic conditions such as obesity and type 2 diabetes, both risk factors for cancer. BreastCancer.org reported in its November 30, 2021, research news article that humans were first used in the trial other than animals.   The article titled Intermittent Fasting May Help Cancer Treatments Work Better, Small, Early Study Suggests that a specific type of intermittent fasting is safe and possible for people diagnosed with cancer and may boost the effectiveness of cancer treatments such as chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and hormonal therapy. It’s the first time this type of intermittent fasting has been studied in people. An Oncologist,  Jummai Jimeta, said she does not know much about the claim.  “not much is known about this claim, and in the instance, there is any chance of it, then it has not been well researched,” she said. Jummai Jimeta is the secretary general of Nigeria’s Association of Radiation and Clinical Oncologists.  The company doctor at AIM group limited, who also hosts ‘health and safety cafe’ on 99.3 Nigeria Info FM Lagos, Frederick Unuigbokhai, submitted that “it is true that fasting has a lot of benefits, but with regards to cancer, findings are still very young.” While agreeing that findings and many breakthroughs have been recorded with animal models, Mr Unuigbokhia added that “the findings on the ground are not enough to run with.”  Available evidence shows that although fasting has been proven effective in treating cancer, it is not a cure. The claim that fasting can cure cancer has been well-researched in the medical field. Although not much work has been done on human trials of this treatment method, it has been proven with animal trials that fasting can be effective in treating cancer.  However, early detection remains the best approach to fighting cancer effectively. ——————————————————————————————————— ”",MOSTLY-TRUE,14/03/2023,https://dubawa.org/how-true-is-twitter-users-claim-fasting-cures-cancer/
"Claim: Lagos state governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, claims his cabinet consists of over 30% women.","Claim: Lagos state governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, claims his cabinet consists of over 30% women.  Verdict: TRUE. Our findings show the Lagos state government’s cabinet has a representation of women 30% and above. In the lead-up to the governorship and state House of Assembly election, candidates contesting for public offices have intensified their efforts to get the support of the people.  On Wednesday, March 8, 2023, the Lagos state governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, seeking re-election for a second term, made a series of tweets to celebrate International Women’s Day.  In this Twitter thread, he asserted that his government had kept its promise of having over 30% women in its cabinet.  A cabinet consists of high-ranking state officials responsible for providing government services. In some places, they are a collegiate decision-making body with collective responsibility, while in others, it may be to play a purely advisory role or assisting role to the head of government (governor or president). According to the governor, his deliberate policy on female representation brought a lot of women leaders into key positions in Lagos. While many applauded the governor for a job well done, a Twitter user Doctor Spec (@doctorspec_ds), disagrees. In his comment, Doctor Spec said, “No one believes your words because it’s full of lies.” DUBAWA decided to verify Mr Sanwo-Olu’s assertion to set the records straight. According to Lagos State’s official website, there are 42 state Executive Council members, for Lagos state including the governor and deputy.  Outside the governor and deputy governor, there are 40 executives, 12 females and 28 males, 30% and 70%, respectively.  Also, a report by Premium Times showed seven special advisers appointed by the governor in 2022. This appointment is male-dominated, having just two female appointees. These female appointees are Aderemi Adebowale; Special Adviser, Civic Engagement and Toke Benson-Awoyinka; Special Adviser on Housing. A comprehensive list of commissioners and special advisers appointed by the Lagos state government from 2019-2023 also shows a similar trend.  Eight of the 22 commissioners appointed are female, while 14 are male. This shows approximately 36% representation of women and 64% representation of men. The eight female commissioners are; Folashade Adefisayo (Education), Cecilia Bolaji Dada (Women Affairs and Poverty Alleviation), Ajibola Ponnle (Establishment, Training and Pension), Aramide Adeyoye (Works and Infrastructure), Uzamat Akinbile-Yusuf (Home Affairs), Yetunde Arobieke (Local Government and Community Affairs), Lola Akande (Commerce and Industry) and Olufunke Adebolu (Tourism Arts and Culture).  There are nine men and four women for special advisers, which is 69% and 31%, respectively.  The four special advisers are; Ruth Bisola Olusanya (Special Adviser on Agriculture), Aderemi Adebowale (Special Adviser on Civic Engagement), Toke Benson-Awoyinka (Special Adviser on Housing) and Solape Hammond (Special Adviser on Sustainable Development Goals). Our findings show that the Lagos state government’s cabinet has a representation of women 30% and above. The claim by the governor is, therefore, true.

"Claim: A Facebook post, allegedly by BBC, solicits funds for Joshua Tosin Ajayi, who sustained injuries from a quarry accident.","GoFundMe and several social media approaches have been used to solicit funds for ailing patients unable to cater for their bills, and Nigerians have been known to sometimes come through with their contributions.  Recently a Facebook post by an alleged BBC News Nigeria seeking support for an ailing man caught the attention of DUBAWA.   The post was shared on February 4, 2023, with three picture frames of a certain Joshua Tosin Ajayi suffering from a spinal and leg injury from the collapse of a quarry he was working in the year 2021.  The tone of the post could manipulate people into contributing. The purported BBC page currently has 73 followers, while the post has garnered over 9,200 reactions with over 5,000 comments and has been shared about 480 times on Facebook. In the past, people have taken advantage of such posts to defraud the public, so DUBAWA decided to verify it and alert the public to the fraudulent scheme.  We first observed this page is not verified, and the number of followers on this account is suspicious compared to the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) status. DUBAWA, hence, searched the official pages of the BBC and discovered that the authentic page of the BBC is BBC News Africa, not BBC News Nigeria. BBC News Africa page is followed by over 5 million Facebook users and is verified by Meta. DUBAWA sent a direct message to BBC News Africa’s official Facebook account to clarify the authenticity of the page that shared the information, but there was no immediate response. We conducted a google reverse image search on the pictures of the supposed victim contained in the post, and it showed no history of such images. A search on TinEye also showed no matches. However, a search on Veracity showed distortions to one of the images posted. The face and neck parts of the picture, given a close look, were photoshopped. Further search showed a Facebook page Daily Nigeria News created on February 8, 2023, with no likes or followers and currently running adverts sharing the same post. The page had the mailing address [email protected]. Also, a google search of Daily News Nigeria showed the site was non-existent and did not have pre-existing content before the post was made to solicit funds from the general public for Joshua Tosin Ajayi. With these perpetrators not giving up their antics towards defrauding unsuspecting Facebook users, another post was shared on a fake NTA News Nigeria page created on February 12, 2023, but this time around with a video of a woman identified as Madam Comfort who delivered twins soliciting for the sum of N750,000 to facilitate her discharge from hospital. Surprisingly,  the post contained the same account details as Joshua Tosin Ajayi, 0728203559, GT Bank The video in the above post has been viewed by 25,000 Facebook users, shared over 80 times, and viewed by over 109,000 users. A reverse image search on Google did not reveal significant information on the video. Hence, DUBAWA conducted a keyword search on Google pinpoint and YouTube, but there were no traces of the videos on those platforms. A keyword search across social media platforms also revealed the same video of a certain Comfort Apeh being shared but this time with an anonymous account with just 23 followers and seven likes.  DUBAWA’s investigation further showed another Facebook page named TVC News Nigerian, with just 153 followers, also put up the same post soliciting funds. The genuine Television Continental Facebook page (@tvcnewsng) is verified by Meta and has over 300,000 followers. An analysis of this series of posts showed notable red flags on all pages that have shared this post. For one, the pages are without proper contact addresses and phone numbers. There is also minimal or no information on when a user clicks on these pages’ ‘About’ section.  These pages all carry a different URL and name when compared. According to Meta policy, a page or account must have the name of the page or account in the URL when copied, but this is not the case for these pages. These pages were all sponsored using unverified email addresses, all almost within the same time frame, with only one post on the profiles. DUBAWA’s investigation reveals that the viral Facebook post showing a bedridden Joshua Tosin Ajayi with leg and spinal cord injury is misleading. The post, alongside a thirty seconds video showing a certain Madam Comfort appealing for financial support, is sponsored to defraud unsuspecting citizens. Thorough research showed these posts were planned to manipulate users into donating money.

"Claim: Results from the IReV portal show that Peter Obi won 19 states, including the FCT.","Following the emergence of Bola Ahmed Tinubu as the winner of the presidential election of February 25, 2023, supporters of opposition parties have expressed their angst against the results announced by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). Mr Tinubu, President-elect of Nigeria, was announced to have polled 8,794,726 votes defeating the 17 other candidates in the presidential race.  He was followed by Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) with 6,984,520 votes, while Peter Obi of the Labour Party took third place with 6,101,533 votes.  The trio of Mr Tinubu, Mr Obi, and Mr Atiku reportedly won in 12 states each, while Rabiu Kwankwaso of the New Nigeria People’s Party (NNPP) won one state. However, some candidates in the election have expressed their disapproval of the result announced. On Monday, Mr Atiku led members of his party (PDP) in a protest at the INEC headquarters in Abuja to register his displeasure over the result.  Mr Obi also said he won the presidential election and would pursue justice through the court. The main bone of contention was the failure of the Bimodal Voters Accreditation System (BVAS) machine to upload the results of the elections held on February 25. Some Facebook users, who are also supporters of the ‘Obidient’ movement, have claimed Mr Obi won in 19 states of the federation, including the FCT. They also added that the PDP candidate only won eight states; the APC presidential candidate won in seven states, while the NNPP candidate won in two states. The claim had gone viral on social media, which prompted us to fact-check the claim. It can be seen here, here and here. DUBAWA visited the INEC’s result viewing portal. As of the time of filing this report at 05:47 pm on March 7, 2023, only results from 164,233 polling units have been uploaded on the IREV portal representing 92.87% of the total 176,846 polling units. This means the results of 12,613 polling units nationwide had yet to be uploaded on the IReV portal. It is, therefore, misleading to dismiss the result announced by INEC and claim that Mr Obi won 19 states, including the FCT. Also, the result uploaded by a Facebook user, Mazi Chiemena Samuel, which showed Labour Party’s victory in about 18 states, including the FCT, is not from the IReV portal. Instead, it is a report from a poll conducted by Nextier on January 27, 2023.  The claim that Obi won in 19 states based on results uploaded on INEC’s IReV is misleading. The 92% uploaded what did it show what is the figure so far I expected to see some kind of proof to what you’re saying not coming to tell me stories, show me data, show me how you added the results then got your conclusion, else shut your mouth up This is great, it is expected of the opposing parties to show us their collated figures and lets compares it with INEC reported report. It is wrong and misleading telling people you won without valid evidence. Please give us proof of the main resilt So, how many states did each candidate win, please verify?

Claim: A newspaper and a pressure group say AMEU President Alvin Attah and AMEZU President Benjamin Lartey have both stepped down.,"On Tuesday, February 14, 2023, the Liberian Government, through the National Commission on Higher Education, issued a statement mandating all Presidents and Vice Presidents for Academic Affairs of Universities in the country to have doctorate degrees. The statement, which went viral on Facebook, states that honorary degree holders are disallowed from serving as a President or Vice President for Academic Affairs at any higher education institutions (universities) in Liberia. As a result of this statement, the lead campaigner of the Campaigners for Academy Crimes Court (CACC) in Liberia, Martin Kollie, posted on Facebook that the Presidents of the African Methodist Episcopal University (AMEU) and the African Methodist Episcopal Zion University (AMEZU) Alvin Attah and Benjamin Lartey respectively had resigned their posts. This post made by Martin Kollie had over 240 comments, 54 shares and over 335 emojis. DUBAWA also contacted Martin Kollie to discover the source of his information, but he said he could not disclose his source because “they are insiders at the two universities.” Martin suggested to DUBAWA that “the presidents resigned but only chose to be hypocritical to save face when Minister Ansu Sonii ‘suspended’ the NCHE policy four days after.” Also, a local daily, The Analyst newspaper, reported in its Friday, February 17, 2023, edition that the Presidents of the two universities have resigned. DUBAWA visited the official websites of AME University and AME Zion University to ascertain whether official statements had been issued by the universities regarding the matter but could find nothing to that effect.      Instead, the two universities stated on Tuesday, February 21, 2023, denying the report by the Analyst newspaper and the lead campaigner of the Campaigners for Academy Crimes Court (CACC) in Liberia, Martin Kollie. “The Board of Trustees of the AME University, the policy-making body of the university, would have had to meet any acceptance of the alleged and speculative resignation letter of the President of the University, as well to decide on any further course of action needed to be taken for the protection and continued smooth operations of the university,” a statement signed by the AME University Board of Trustees reads. The statement furthered, “the publication was made in the absence of any evidence of a meeting having been held by the Board of Trustee of the AMEU to discuss any of the issues stated in the analyst’s speculative and false news story.”  A statement signed by the AME Zion University Vice President administration also reads, “the Board of Trustees and administration of the African Methodist Episcopal Zion University (AMEZU) all partners, students, employees and the general public, that information being circulated about the resignation of Dr Benjamin Lartey, President of the University is false and diabolical and intended to undermine the University.”  DUBAWA also engaged authorities of the National Commission on Higher Education (NCHE) as to what prompted their recent decision and why it was necessary. According to the NCHE Head, Professor Edward Lama Wonkeryor, the decision resulted from a promise made months ago to eliminate the rising number of tertiary institution presidents without terminal degrees. He clarified that it was a way to stop the country’s higher education system from deteriorating. “To achieve the much-needed reform of our higher education system as advocated by President George Manneh Weah, the NCHE is implementing all policies and standards established for the governance of the sector, especially those policies that seek to place our higher education system into equivalence with our regional and international contemporaries,” the Professor said.   However, DUBAWA discovered that the Ministry of Education is not in favour of said policy issued by the NCHE. Consequently, the Ministry, through its Minister, told the state-owned media entity, The Liberia Broadcasting System or ELBC, that the policy has been suspended and will remain so until the Board of Commissioners of the NCHE meets. “The policy will remain suspended until the NCHE Director General, Dr Edward Wonkeryor, and the Board of Commissioners meet for appropriate consultation and justification. While the Board of Commissioners is committed to reforming the higher education sector, and policy implementation must be done appropriately,” Minister Ansu Sonii said. The National Commission on Higher Education (NCHE) was founded in 1989 by an Act of the National Legislature to formulate broad policy guidelines for establishing Institutions of Higher Education in Liberia. It serves as the regulatory body for all institutions offering degrees and as the principal liaison between institutions of learning offering degrees in the country. Based on extensive research made by DUBAWA concerning claims made by both the Analyst newspaper and the lead campaigner of the Campaigners for Academy Crimes Court (CACC) lead campaigner, the two university presidents are still effective in their respective posts.

"Claim: A Twitter user tweeted that over 4,000 couples applied for divorce in January 2023.","In recent times, Nigerians have raised concerns around the rising divorce cases, especially among young couples, with more individuals looking southward when discussing marriage as an institution.  Premium Times also reports that couples file for divorce due to issues around lack of compatibility, abandonment, infidelity, and so much more. These factors make it imperative to ensure that information that is digested by the general public, especially on social media, is accurate and will not be the last straw that breaks the camel’s back. Consequently, a Twitter user, Shaba Baba Muhammad (@spychief), in a viral tweet viewed by over 51,000 Twitter users and shared multiple times on other social media platforms, alleged over 4,000 divorce cases have been filed in Nigeria’s capital city, Abuja, in January alone. He states that these couples are mostly less than one year in the marital institution. However, some people questioned the source of the claim.  The importance of verifying this claim is due to the engagement that has followed since it was first shared and to enlighten the general public on the accurate number of divorce cases filed in the month under review, as this will help end this falsehood being peddled annually. Although there’s a spate of rising divorce cases, as young people become weary of the marital institution, figures made available to DUBAWA’s researcher show the figure is not as high as 4,000. DUBAWA visited the high court of the Federal Capital Territory, Maitama, Abuja and found out that only 32 divorce cases have been filed as of January 24, 2023.

Claim: Africa Facts Zone claims the Labour Party (LP) won 42 National Assembly seats and seven Senate seats.,"The announcement of results from the Nigerian general elections has set off controversial debates among citizens who question the fairness of the voting process. Following this, Africa Facts Zone announced on Twitter that the Labour Party (LP) had won 42 seats at the National Assembly and seven at the Senate after the Labor Party presidential candidate Peter Obi joined the political group. The claimant further alleged that the LP won seven and 35 at the Senate and House of Representatives, respectively. The claim has attracted over 13 thousand likes, 4,481 retweets and 251 comments featuring misinformation. For instance, @IbomPrincess, a user who believed this information to be accurate, affirmed “the feat” without questioning. “They said LP had no structure. Well, here it is. He who laughs last laughs best,” she reacted. Similarly, another user, @ADEBOWALE_03, also commented, believing the tweet to be accurate. He said: “Peter Obi’s grace is exceptional. In fact, someone can use his name to seek blessing and grace from Al-Mighty God, and such prayers would be answered. Grace dey flow on that man’s head.” To curb the spread of misinformation and highlight the accurate result, DUBAWA decided to investigate. Firstly, we conducted a Google keyword search, producing many reports published by credible news platforms. In a Premium Times publication, referencing the breakdown released by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), the Labour Party won 34 and six at the House of Representatives and Senate, respectively. This makes a total of 40 seats, as against the viral post, which had “42”. Likewise, this same information has been published by TheCable, ChannelsTV and ThisDay. The Labour Party has only won 40 National Assembly seats, not 42 as purported by Africa Facts Zone. ",FALSE-,06/03/2023,https://dubawa.org/labour-party-won-40-not-42-seats-at-national-assembly/
Claim: “Most guys are not bald naturally; masturbation makes them bald.”,"Baldness in men is a common phenomenon but sometimes becomes a concern when it happens at a much younger age. Sometimes, people who experience hair loss have used medical intervention to redeem it.  A former English striker, Wayne Rooney, is an example of a person who has undergone a hair transplant. It was so important to him that, two years after the first transplant failed, he went again at age 27 for a second one. While the cause of Rooney’s baldness was known to be male pattern baldness and found to be hereditary, several other reasons exist. However, a tweet asserts that masturbation is why most men are bald. “Most guys ain’t bald naturally, masturbation made them bald, the more you masturbate, the more you lose hair, stop masturbating guys to keep your hairline intact,” the tweet reads.  The tweet got a combination of retweets, likes, comments and views in 159 engagements. The tweet in the screenshot below came from a user known as @JAY6th. Similar claims were made here and here, with a combined engagement of over 400. Seeing the belief is widely shared,  DUBAWA deemed it necessary to verify the claim. Baldness, according to hopkinsmedicine.org, is a state of hair loss or absence of hair. It’s also called alopecia. Baldness is usually most noticeable on the scalp but can happen anywhere on the body where hair grows. The condition is more common in men than in women.  Masturbation, on the other hand, is an erotic stimulation, especially of one’s genital organs, commonly resulting in orgasm and is achieved by manual or other bodily contacts exclusive of sexual intercourse, by instrumental manipulation, occasionally by sexual fantasies, or by various combinations of these agencies.  Looking at both definitions, it is difficult not to wonder where these two phenomena meet. In verifying this, DUBAWA dug into research and publications on the subject.  In the video here, Metromale Clinic, which has over 64,000 YouTube subscribers, published a video by a Sexologist, Karthik Gunasekaran, who says masturbation has nothing to do with hair loss.  According to Karthik, when a man masturbates, the only thing lost is semen, which has nothing whatsoever with hair loss. He states that the only thing that can cause hair loss is Testosterone, and this is not connected to masturbation.  This article published by HairMD in May 2021 revealed that no medical proof was found that masturbation or sexual activities cause hair loss. It further explained that DHT (DiHydroTestosterone), proven to cause baldness, is not produced during masturbation or sexual activity. We also discovered a fact-check by The Cable in August 2022, which rated this claim false. A medical doctor, Frederick Unuigbokhai, in an interview with DUBAWA, stated that there is no medically proven link between masturbation and baldness.  He explained that baldness happens in both men and women and that a high level of testosterone can lead to a heightened urge for sex and which could lead to masturbation but does not result in baldness.  Click here to learn the possible causes, symptoms, treatments, and other relevant baldness information.  Our findings show that there is no medical proof that masturbation causes baldness. The claim that it does is a myth.  ———————————————————————————————————————-  ”",FALSE,03/03/2023,https://dubawa.org/no-masturbation-does-not-lead-to-baldness-in-men/

"Claim: ‘Former Vice President has decided to support Cummings following retirement from politics,’ Sekou Kalasco Damaro, Presidential Aide to Weah, alleges.","A screenshot of an alleged Facebook account, which carries the photograph and full name of Joseph Nyumah Boakai (JNB), was widely shared, saying: “I have served the people for over 43 years and understand that it is time to move on in different directions. Today I have decided to withdraw my bid for the presidency. I believe the way forward is to give a chance to somebody who understands how to fix this country. I’ve decided to support Alex Cumming.   “I’ve served the people for over 43 years and understand that it is now time to move in a different direction. Today, I’ve decided to withdraw my bid for the presidency. I believe the way forward is to give a chance to somebody who understands how to fix this country. I’ve decided to support Cummings.”     One of the Facebook users who shared the news was an aide to the incumbent president, Sekou Kalasco Damaro. Damaro captioned the post: “Finally, former Vice President Boakai has decided to support Cummings. The game is on.” The post generated mixed reactions in public, culminating in over five hundred comments and two hundred emoji on Facebook.  Like Sekou, another Facebook user Samson Mosery believed to be a supporter of Mr Alexander Cummings, wrote that the news of Mr Boakai stepping down was confirmed. In addition, Estrada Duke Jayajy posted a picture of Ghana’s sitting president Akufo-Addo congratulating JNB on Twitter about his supposed resignation from politics. Amid the rounds of his resignation from politics and subsequent support for Mr Cummings of the opposition Alternative National Congress (ANC), Joseph Boakai, in response, debunked the claim while describing the screenshot as ‘fake.’ “I’ve seen a screenshot of a post circulating on social media from a fake Joseph Nyuma Boakai page that I am not contesting for the presidency in October 2023. Let me reassure the Liberians that nothing will stop the Rescue Mission we are embarking upon. We will be on the ballot, and with God above, we will succeed in rescuing this our beloved country,” he said. DUBAWA also visited the official Twitter page of Ghanaian President Nana Akufo-Addo, hoping to find the post in which the president congratulated JNB but saw nothing of that sort. After carefully examining the page containing the controversial tweet, DUBAWA observed that the blue tick had been used as a verified account for the president. However, checks on the official Twitter account of Ghana’s president show a grey tick instead. According to Twitter, the blue verified ticks are for persons or individuals, whilst the grey verified ticks are for governments. Based on our findings, the claim that Boakai has resigned from Liberian politics and has decided to support Alexander B. Cummings is false.

The ten minutes video posted by the Facebook page shows the INEC chairman, Mahmood Yakubu, addressing the press for different reasons, including states that ballot boxes were destroyed, violence occurred, BVAS was stolen, and some political parties omitted on the ballot papers.  The sensitivity of the electoral process that is still ongoing and the virality of the post made DUBAWA verify the claim as it can lead to agitation by the affected parties. We conducted an advanced search on the video and found that Channels Television originally posted it. We also discovered that other Television and media houses had uploaded the same video.  The video was from the INEC press briefing by the Chairman at the National Collation Centre, Abuja, on Saturday. The four wards marred with violence and disruption in Yenagoa were rescheduled to hold the next day.  In Edo state, one of the parties whose acronym rather than the logo was on the ballot paper in Esan North, Esan South, and Igueben has been rescheduled to hold on to March 11 with newly printed ballot papers. This is to ensure that no Nigerian citizen would be disenfranchised.  Our findings show that the video is true.

Claim: Lawmaker Ado Garba says the law expects an aspiring member of the House of Representatives to have N70 million in hard currency to fund their campaign.,"A member of the House of Representatives and Majority Leader representing Doguwa/Tudun Wada Federal Constituency of Kano State, Ado Garba, has said the law allows a lawmaker access to up to N70 million in physical currency for an election campaign. In a video clip shared on Twitter by onejoblessboy, Garba stated that he is permitted under the law to have access to N70 million in ‘in hard copy’ to organise his election campaign as an aspiring candidate. “The law has permitted me to have N70 million as logistics for my election funding. I need to have this N70 million in hard copy,” he said. “That is the position of the law”. Garba added that the “law has provided all we need to oversee our election process” and explained that “you need to pay your agents in the villages, where you do not have ATMs… POS… where absolutely you do not have this new naira.”  The 2022 Electoral Act, Section 88, Sub-section four, clearly provides that campaign expenses for a senatorial or house of representatives candidate should not exceed N100 million and N70 million respectively.  “The maximum amount of election expenses to be incurred by a candidate in respect of Senatorial and House of Representatives seat shall not exceed N100,000,000 and N70,000,000 respectively,” the Act reads.  However, the provision does not mention nor discuss the mode in which the capped capital for the election expenses can and should be wielded. DUBAWA interviewed a lawyer and the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Afri Forecasts, Eluma Asogwua, who explained that the Act only stipulates the amount of money an aspirant may expend for their campaign.  “No person or body corporate shall, except in a transaction through a Financial Institution, make or accept cash payment of a sum exceeding N5,000,000.00 or its equivalent, in the case of an individual; or N10, 000,000.00 or its equivalent, in the case of a body corporate,”  Asogwua added, referring to the Money Laundering (Prohibition) Act. Another legal practitioner, a lawyer at Adelante Castle Attorneys, Elizabeth Achile, debunked the claim. Achile said that although the Electoral Act limits the amount that can be expended in an election, the money is not meant to be spent “using cash at the polling unit.”  She clarified that “electoral expenses” means “expenses incurred by a political party within the period from the date notice is given by the commission to conduct an election up to the polling day in respect of the particular election.” “The naira policy or cashless policy does not, in any way, affect this because it is not saying that [the person] should bring [N70 million] and share to people [rather] it is saying that this is the money you can spend,” she added. Achile finally added that the law cautions the amount of money politicians can spend legitimately or even illegitimately “because an audited statement of account will be sent to INEC after the elections to show how much has been spent.” The claim is false as the electoral act only explains the limitation to the amount a political candidate may spend for an election. It does not suggest that the money should be in hard currency.  ",FALSE,24/02/2023,https://dubawa.org/house-of-representatives-member-ado-garba-makes-false-claims-about-election-campaign-funds/
Claim: Social media users say a Rivers State politician has been arrested with a huge sum of money purportedly given to him by Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate Atiku Abubakar.,"Social media users claim a member of the House of Representatives, Chinyere Igwe, has been arrested by operatives of the Rivers State Police Command. Igwe, who represents Port Harcourt II Federal Constituency, was allegedly found with a cash sum of over $500,000 given to him by the PDP’s presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, with a list containing the sharing formula to voters.  The spokesperson of the Rivers State Police Command, Grace Iringe-Koko, confirmed Igwe’s arrest to DUBAWA in a phone call. Iringe-Koko explained that the Igwe was arrested with a large sum of money in foreign currency but noted that investigations were still on.  “Yes, it’s true. He has been arrested. I have a release on it. He was arrested with a large sum of money in foreign currency (dollars),” the spokesperson told DUBAWA. When asked if there had been a connection between the arrest and the PDP presidential candidate, she said, “What I know is that he had a large sum of money with him, and an investigation is still ongoing.” A tweet by the Rivers State Police Command carried a viral image which showed the politician sitting before stacks of the dollar currency. “Police Officers from Rivers State Command deployed to INEC Headquarters Aba  Road today, 24/2/2023, at about 0245hrs, while on stop and search, arrested one Hon Chinyere Igwe, member House of Representatives representing Port Harcourt II Federal Constituency. He was arrested with a cash sum of 498,100 USD inside a bag in his car. Also recovered was a list for distribution of the money,” the statement partly reads.

Another handle Olúwamáyọ̀wá ÀKÀNNÍ @iam_mayoor, posted, “Even your soon ex-governor was at the rally #PeterObi4President2023” A reverse image search led to the original image posted by Jubril Gawat @Mr_JAGs, the Senior Special Assistant (SSA) to the Governor of Lagos State, on New Media on Twitter at an earlier time (6:57 PM). “Their VP went to chill at Polo Club jejely and quickly used the opportunity to hail the big boss, the Performing Governor 😁😁😁,” the tweet reads.  We also contacted the state government through the Commissioner for Information, who dismissed the claim, “if the governor was at the rally, would you not see it on media stations and television?” The Commissioner said. The claim that the Lagos state governor was at the Labour Party presidential rally on February 11, 2023, is false. The image shared is of the Lagos state governor and the Labour party vice presidential candidate at a polo club.

Claim: INEC will not use university lecturers as returning officers for the 2023 general election.,"A WhatsApp post claims the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) will not use university lecturers as returning officers in the 2023 General Election.  The post, forwarded to various WhatsApp groups, appears to be a press release credited to Festus Okoye, a National Commissioner and Information and Voter Education Committee Chairperson.  The supposed press release dated Thursday, January 5, 2023, reads: “INEC decided that they will not use University Lecturers as returning officers for the 2023 Election. INEC will use only their staff for the exercise.” The claim has also gone viral on Facebook, where it appears to have been shared since January 10, 2023, was still trending as of February 21, 2023. It was also posted on group pages and shared by individual accounts. The first redflag was the absence of INEC’s letterhead and the press release’s informal nature. To further authenticate the originality of the post, DUBAWA checked the Twitter handle of INEC (@inecnigeria), where it found a press release with the same date signed by Festus Okoye but on a different subject matter.  Further verification revealed that INEC met with the Vice Chancellors of Universities, where it asked them to shortlist only lecturers who are non-partisan and have no criminal records of serving as Returning and Collation officers in the 2023 General Election.

Claim: WhatsApp message alleged the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) is moving people to other polling units to disenfranchise them.,"The total number of polling units were increased to 176,974 after INEC created an additional 56,872 Polling Units in June 2021 to accommodate the increasing numbers of registered voters. INEC’s Head of Department, Voter Education and Publicity, in Kwara State, Adamu Musa, explained that the Commission, in line with Section 40 (2) of the Electoral Act 2022, decided to move some registered voters from polling units with registered voters above 750 to other units with fewer numbers.  He added that some voters are being moved to the polling units within the same constituency as the previous ones.  Musa stated that the measure will not disenfranchise affected registered voters as they will be duly informed and directed to the new polling units where their names were moved to. He explained further that the list of names of the affected registered voters would be pasted at the wards to enable them confirm their polling units before Election Day. Musa added that there would be adequate publicity in the media to ensure that the information reaches the persons concerned and other stakeholders. This was also confirmed in a post by INEC on its verified Twitter handle, assuring affected registered voters that its State Offices will duly inform them on the polling units assigned to them.  DUBAWA also verified the link in the message and found it original to INEC, as voters can use this to confirm their polling unit.  Our verification revealed that although the Independent National Electoral Commission is allotting new polling units to some electorates, it is not to disenfranchise them but to ensure that the newly created polling units do not record zero votes and overcrowding is avoided on Election Day.

"Claim: A WhatsApp broadcast message, shared multiple times, states that banks are shutting ICT services due to the election.","Nigerians remain caught in the web of naira scarcity due to the currency redesign and reeling in the pain of being unable to carry out financial activities on the heels of a crucial electioneering season (February 25, 2023, general elections). There has been a high level of uncertainty as citizens flock to the banks to access cash, especially with the epileptic digital banking services.  Thus, messages have been circulated across different WhatsApp groups that network providers, bank transfers, and all relevant ICT units will be halted. Angela George, a Facebook user with over 12,000 followers, has also shared the message with her followers.  DUBAWA is fact-checking this claim due to the importance of the assertion and the reach and level of engagement it has garnered so far, especially when many Nigerian citizens are currently in a pensive mood due to the cash crunch and with the general elections close by.  False and misleading information about voting and elections hurts both individuals and institutions of a nation, be it financial or politically related, because, in most cases, good economics translates to good politics. It is, therefore, imperative to put out the right information for the nation’s electorate. With an increased spate of complaints from Nigerians across social media platforms like Twitter about how digital platforms of banks have further deepened, an already existing trust deficit is aggravated by the inefficiencies of these platforms. To verify the authenticity of the WhatsApp claim, DUBAWA reached out to the corporate communications department of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). According to the spokesperson, Osita Nwasinobi, the message is untrue. He said the bank did not send out such information, whether by anonymity or otherwise, as it has been suggested in the original claim and should be disregarded.  He further disseminated a picture to journalists, tagging the message as “Fake News.” The official handle of the Central Bank of Nigeria (@cenbank) also shared a tweet warning Nigerians that the information is false. Some part of the message also further posits that network providers will shut down operations for these banks’ digital platforms and Information Communication Technology units. On the back of this, DUBAWA’s researcher sent a message to the head of media relations at the Nigeria Communications Commission (NCC), Omoniyi Ibietan, who said the message had been forwarded to the NCC boss and further correspondence would be communicated. Likewise, according to news reports from (February 11, 2023) on Vanguard, Dailypost and Businessday, the spokesperson of the CBN, in a statement, debunked messages making the rounds about plans to shut down banks. The statement states in part: “Similarly, there is a misleading voice note trending in social media alleging that the CBN planned to shut down some banks, particularly in a particular geo-political region of the country. “We wish to state unequivocally that there is no such plan and that the claims are illogical and do not comply with the workings of the Nigerian banking system.” DUBAWA also discovered that some domestic banks, such as Guaranty Trust Bank (GTB), have emailed customers to indicate the early closure of branches on today (February 24, 2023). GTB, however, assured its alternative channel is always available for any banking needs.  Additionally, the verified Twitter account of the United Bank of Africa (UBA), in a direct message on Twitter, dismissed the claim as false. However, other deposit banks have not communicated any message related to communication shutdown or closure as of the time of filing this report. Although there is a high level of apprehension due to the cash-strap situation in Nigeria with the count down to the general elections, DUBAWA’s findings show that the purported message telling Nigerians to withdraw their monies from banks until after the election is False.

Claim: Printouts of voter information can be used to vote on election day.,"Claim: Printouts of voter information can be used to vote on election day.  Verdict: FALSE. Our findings and INEC voting procedure show only the permanent Voters Card will be used for accreditation and voting.  On Friday, February 24, 2023, a viral WhatsApp message with the assertion that everyone must vote, whether they have their Permanent Voters Card (PVC) or not, was drawn to our attention.  The message directs that people who registered but were unable to get their PVC should follow a link and print out their details which can be presented on election day for voting.  The link, which is that of the Independent National Electoral Commission’s (INEC) Voter Verification Service, is meant for finding voters’ information. This information consists of the Voter’s Identification Number (VIN), State, Local Government Area (LGA), Registration Area (Ward), and Polling Unit Code. The message has sparked hope in those who registered but could not get their card. Many such people sent this message to DUBAWA requesting confirmation.  The virality of the message, its significance to voters’ decisions and the likelihood of confusing PUs on election day prompted us to verify the claim.   To verify this, we searched INEC’s Twitter page and website for helpful information on voting and what is needed to vote. We have also done a similar fact-check on the possibility of voting without the PVC and found it false and impossible.  INEC has repeatedly said, ‘No PVC, no voting.’ In this tweet, INEC wrote, “with your PVC, you have the power to make a difference.” So all you need to vote on election day is your PVC.  INEC has shared the procedure on election day and a step-by-step breakdown of the voting process. In this breakdown, only the PVC is presented for accreditation before voting.  To vote on election day, you must first appear in person at your PU by 8:00 am with your PVC and wait for voting, starting at 8:30 am.  Below is a seven-step breakdown of the voting procedure by INEC.  Our findings and INEC voting procedure show only the permanent Voters Card will be used for accreditation and voting.

"Claim: Reno Omokri on Twitter asserted that civil servants in Nigeria earn N18,000 as minimum wage.","Former Special Assistant to President Goodluck Jonathan, and staunch supporter of the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, stated that the minimum wage in Nigeria is currently N18,000. On January 16, 2023, in an attempt to canvass votes for the PDP presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, Mr Omokri, on his verified Twitter handle @renoomokri, taunted Nigeria civil servants on their choice of a Presidential Candidate in the coming 2023 General Election.  He asked if they could live on the N18,000 Minimum Wage they earn. Twitter users in the comment section didn’t believe his assertion and mocked him for reducing himself.  One user, @Ruthlmelda8, said, “Lies,” while another user @COkekeOfficial wrote, “shame on you! You are worth nothing.” Reno has become notorious for making spurious claims, and it is strange to say the minimum wage which has been reviewed is still N18,000. This prompted us to verify this claim.  A quick search showed that contrary to the N18,000 minimum wage assertion by Reno Omokri, the current minimum wage, according to the National Minimum Wage Act 2019, is N30,000. The principle behind minimum wage is to ensure workers are not paid unduly low wages and to combat poverty and inequality, including gender disparity, amongst the working population.  According to the International Labor Organization (ILO), which Nigeria is a signatory to, 92% of its 186 Member States have adopted the minimum wage. This shows that a large majority of countries in the world use minimum wage to protect workers. A major game changer in minimum wage agitations in Nigeria was the National Minimum Wage Act of 2004. For the first time, workers had a real document to refer to. The Act then provided for a minimum wage of N5,500.  However, this increased in 2011, following an amendment to the Act (National Minimum Wage Act 2011) which provided for N18,000 as minimum wage.  Subsequently, in 2019 a new minimum wage of N30,000 monthly was approved, which is the current minimum.  In May 2022, workers in Nigeria began to advocate for a new minimum wage to cushion the effect of the economic hardship in the country. This was followed by a pronouncement in January 2023 by the spokesperson of the National Salaries, Incomes and Wages Commission (NSIWC), Emmanuel Njoku that the process of review of the National Minimum Wage will begin soon in line with the provisions of the National Minimum Wage Act, 2019.  The Minister of Labour and Employment, Senator Chris Ngige, also assured workers at the 13th quadrennial delegates conference of the Nigeria Labour Congress, NLC, held in Abuja that a new minimum wage will take effect come May 2024. Furthermore, some political parties and presidential candidates have been making juicy promises of what amount they will pay workers if elected. Amid this controversy, the question “will the minimum wage be increased from the current N30,000 monthly” and many others linger.  The International Labor Organization, ILO, Minimum Wage Fixing Convention, 1971 (No. 131) encourage member states to create a system of minimum wages which: The claim by Reno Omokri that the current minimum wage is N18,000 is false.

Claim: Facebook page claims the LGBTQ+ movement of Nigeria has endorsed Atiku Abubakar for the 2023 presidential elections.,"Amidst campaign rallies in the country and how important endorsements and decamping are to the politicians, a Facebook page named “Nigerian News Hausa” published a post alleging that members of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBTQ+) community support Atiku to become Nigeria’s president in 2023. The same claim has appeared in numerous articles, such as on a website called the ‘Independent.ng, and all quoted anonymous representatives of the LGBT movement. In another post by a user named Aliyu Comrade, the same text and pictures were published with a similar claim. Many comments that trailed the post debunked the news in the comments box, while some were wooing at it.  One user, Abubakar Sadiq Umar, even stressed that the people were paid (LGBTQ+) in 2019 to paint Atiku’s name black, but in 2023 that won’t happen, adding that if the news is true, varying media outlets will publish it.  “Abunda kukayi 2019 aka baku kudi kuka batawa atiku suna ..  ta lashe APC Zabe. To 2023 karinyaku tasha karya wlh kowani dan Nigeria mai wayo ne yenzu kowani dan Nigeria mai ilimi ne da tunani… Kuci kudin Bola.. Mukuma ranan zabe Musha Abola mu hargar. Idan Kuma gaskiyane jaridu masu inganchi zasu yada” A Google keyword search reveals the claim has been online since 2018 when Mr Atiku was contesting for the presidential office ahead of the 2019 elections. A report by the Tribune news outlet, a widely circulated Nigerian newspaper published in 2018 and updated in 2019, indicated that the LGBT movement in Nigeria had endorsed Atiku Abubakar.  Other results show a report by the Independent News, published on October 26, also tells a similar story. Apart from these sources, there has not been any recent endorsement found, and there is no credible information to support the claim that the LGBTQ+ movement has endorsed Atiku for president in 2023. However, while endorsements by social movements or organisations are typically publicly announced and widely reported, this particular one was not available in any official statement or announcement by the LGBTQ+ community endorsing Atiku. In all the reports, Diverse, the group representing the LGBTQ+ community in Nigeria, was quoted through an official called Spinky Victor Lee, who was said to be the group’s “Community President of Nigeria.”    However, a thorough search online reveals no evidence that either Spinky Victor Lee or Diverse exists. Evidently, before the alleged statements of support for Atiku’s campaign, there is no record of any statements or activities attributed to the group. This is not the first time a claim has been made heads, in a 2018 fact-check published by AFP on a similar claim related to Mr Atiku revealed that The Initiative for Equal Rights (TIERS), a non-governmental which advocates for the rights of sexual minorities clarified that no evidence shows either “Diverse” or “Spinky Victor Lee” exists. According to DUBAWA’s investigation, the claim is misleading.  ",MISLEADING,23/02/2023,https://dubawa.org/did-lgbtq-movement-endorse-atiku-for-the-2023-elections/
Claim: Nigeria’s agricultural revolution has created over 13 million direct and indirect jobs.,"Recently, President Muhammadu Buhari has been releasing statements quoting the success of his administration. Mr Buhari said he served Nigerians well to the best of his ability and disappointed no one.  In December 2022, the president, while speaking at an interactive session in the United States, noted that targeted interventions by his administration in the agricultural sector had created 13 million direct and indirect jobs.  In a statement, Garba Shehu, the presidential spokesperson, quoted him as saying, “This agricultural revolution has led to the creation of over 13 million direct and indirect jobs.” Mr Buhari also said the country has been able to handle the systemic shock caused by both COVID-19 and the Russia-Ukraine war on global food supply chains and attendant price spikes. The country’s agricultural sector has battled several challenges over the years, which limited its growth despite numerous interventions. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the sector’s low performance is caused by many challenges impacting its productivity. These, the organisation said, include; poor land tenure systems, low levels of irrigation farming, climate change and land degradation, low technology, high production cost and poor distribution of inputs, and limited financing, among others.  According to Statista, employment in agriculture is the share of individuals working in agriculture, hunting, forestry, and fishing to produce a good or service for profit or pay from the total employed. The latest data from the World Bank (2019) shows that employment in agriculture is only 35% of the total employment rate in the country, whereas, in 1991, it was 51% of the total employment.  The World Bank further aggregated the number of Nigeria’s Labour force in 2019 to 62.9 million.  For context, given the labour force in 2019 is 62.9 million and the total percentage of unemployment equals 10.7%, which is 6.7 million, it means the total employment figure for the same year is 56 million.  It also means since employment in agriculture is 35% of total employment (56 million), there are estimated 19.6 million agriculture-related jobs. The question then is how many of these people are engaged in paid or unpaid services in the agriculture sector? The World Bank, in its explanation, noted that total employment involves wage and salaried workers (also known as employees); and self-employed workers, with its subcategories: which included self-employed workers with employees (employers); self-employed workers without employees (own-account workers), and; members of producers’ cooperatives and contributing family workers (also known as unpaid family workers). The situation explained in Nigeria’s economic update by the World Bank showed that between 2005 and 2015, Agriculture accounted for 40 per cent of Nigerian workers. The report noted that labour has gradually shifted from agriculture to other sectors over time.  “Over time, employment in less-productive sectors like agriculture and manufacturing have dropped, and employment in the highly productive resource sector has gone up,” it added.  Meanwhile, Nigeria’s unemployment rate is currently at 33.3%, with about only 30 million persons fully employed, according to the latest data by the National Bureau of Statistics. This shows that there’s been an increase in the unemployment rate from 10.4% in Q4 2015. Prof Segun Ajibola, former President of the Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria (CIBN) and professor of economics at Babcock University, told the Nigerian Fact-checkers coalition (NFC) that there’s been a steady decline in the number of people engaged in Agriculture from independence till date.  On how to measure indirect job opportunities in the Agricultural sector, the don noted that Agriculture has spillover effects and involves both backward and forward integration. “For example, those who are involved in primary agriculture, they produce, these are people who grow yam, rice, produce palm oil, palm kernel, cotton and so on, that’s the primary segment.  “Those involved in the secondary level, the transporters: those who transport from the farm to warehouses, those who keep the products in warehouses, the silos, the marketers, those who eventually process those products. For instance, cocoa, those who buy cocoa and those who transport cocoa, there are some cocoa processing factories in Nigeria like Ile Oluji cocoa processing factory, all those working there will be counted as people working in agriculture, that’s forward integration. “Then there are those who use those products like Nigeria Breweries, Guinness, Nestle food, some of them have what they call farmer-grower skill. They give money to farmers; that’s what we call backward integration. They give money to farmers to produce corn, which they process into other products, the same way Nestle foods have farms where they grow some of these products; all of them, for example, Nestle food will regard themselves as working in Agriculture because what they do is to process agricultural products to finished products, a segment of PZ will see themselves as still working in Agriculture, same thing with Guinness, same thing Nigerian Breweries. “Marketers, transporters, sellers, those who work in agro-allied businesses like cocoa processing farms and so on, all of them will be counted as those who work in agriculture and agricultural-related businesses. They will regard themselves as part of employment in agriculture. I think it’s from that angle that the president is looking at it as opposed to the World Bank looking at agriculture from the angle of those involved in agriculture as a means of livelihood.” President Buhari came into power in 2015. As observed, employment in agriculture as a share of total employment has witnessed a steady decline from 37.51% in 2014 to 35% in 2019, according to the World Bank. From the foregoing, there is no sufficient evidence to show that the current administration’s interventions in the agricultural sector have provided 13 million direct and indirect jobs in the country. This is evident in the fact that the sector’s employment rate has been declining.  When the Nigerian Fact-checkers Coalition contacted Shehu to highlight the data source quoted by Mr Buhari, he referred the researcher back to the speech the president gave in New York, which does not serve as a credible source.  There is insufficient evidence to support Buhari’s claim that interventions in Agricultural have provided 13 million jobs in Nigeria as the unemployment rate in the sector was on a decline during the period reviewed.

Claim: A viral post on Twitter asserts that the Labour Party does not have agents for Saturday’s election.,"In less than three days, Nigerians across the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory would file out at the various Polling Units (PU) nationwide to choose the next president. During the elections, political parties deploy their agents to PUs to observe the electoral process, monitor the conduct of election officials, and safeguard the integrity of the election. The role of political party agents is crucial as they represent the interest of their party at the polling station, ensuring that the election is free, fair, and credible.  In anticipation of the elections on Saturday, a viral tweet by Pastor Who (@PastorMarvy) alleged that Labour Party will not have agents at most polling units during the elections on Saturday. The post read, “The Labour Party will not have polling agents in over 75% of the polling units in the country. I mean, nobody will monitor their votes in 135,740 polling units on Saturday. I sincerely apologize to Gringory, Obidients and Labour Party for thinking that they are a serious entity!” Other users made a big fuss about this; for instance, Rinu Oduala (@SavvyRinu) tweeted that this narrative that LP has insufficient agents to cover the election is the work of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the People’s Democratic Party (PDP).  She noted that LP has over 130,000 polling absents across Nigeria.  “PDAPC came together in their usual fashion today to spread fake news against LP.  The party has 130,000+ polling agents across the country.  To do this in barely eight months, give PO and the Obedient movement their flowers abeg!” She wrote.  The controversy and possible tension this could stir with the release election close by prompted us to verify this claim. To verify this claim, we checked the Independent National Electoral Commission’s (INEC) official Twitter handle, INEC Nigeria (@inecnigeria) and found that the commission posted a summary of the list of polling unit and collation centres agents submitted by different parties. The list reveals that the Labour Party has 134,874 PU agents and 4,859 Collation agents nationwide.  In another development, the African Democratic Congress (ADC) endorsed the Labour Party Presidential candidate Peter Obi and his running mate, Datti Baba-Ahmed, for the February 25 presidential election as reported here, here and here. The ADC also announced through its official Twitter handle African Democratic Congress (@ADCNig) following a coalition formation.  The post reads, “The African Democratic Congress, ADC cordially invites you to her PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE’S ENDORSEMENT @PeterObi EVENT held today, February 20, 2023. To watch the event LIVE, kindly follow our Facebook page African Democratic Congress HQ https://facebook.com/ADCNig?mibextid=ZbWKwL. If with this endorsement, ADC makes available its PU agents (96,043) and collation agents (3,626), then the LP will cover more grounds.  The claim that the Labour Party does not have agents for the Saturday election is false. INEC, through its official Twitter account, confirmed this by releasing a list of agents submitted by political parties.

Claim: A Twitter influencer alleged that some European protesters recently harassed Godwin Obaseki.,"As Nigeria prepares for another election, misinformation and the distortion of context, especially on social media, have become a regular occurrence in the political scene, with opposing camps deploying it to suit a narrative.  Recently, a Twitter influencer, Chris (@topboychris), with positive political leanings towards the River’s State governor, Nyesom Wike, shared a video showing some Nigerians on the streets of a foreign country, verbally abusing Godwin Obaseki, the Edo State Governor. In the 57 seconds video, the man who appears to be Godwin Obaseki in a suit is approached by a group of protesters, shouting “ole” (thief)  as he walks away. Mr Chris captioned the video, “Obaseki was embarrassed today in Europe 😂😂😂.” The video has so far garnered 199k views; the tweet has been seen 553K times and has over 5530 likes, alongside 2518 retweets. The same narrative has also been featured on ExolaTv with the headline:  “Video: How Governor Obaseki Was Humiliated, Harassed By Nigerians In Europe” The alleged incident has elicited different reactions from respondents, as some believe the video is recent while others felt otherwise.  Ada Idemili (@tellmarh) wrote: “That’s what fits these shameless people. Diasporans doing the lord’s work. See him walking without security. In Nigeria, 100 jobless policemen go follow am for back.” On his part, Okoeguela Joseph (@okoeguelajosef1) wrote:  “This is just the beginning; as long as our criminal politicians refuse to make Nigeria better, they will continually face disgrace abroad. They must learn this lesson,” he said. There were other commenters who recognised the video as old and called out the original poster for misinformation. Son of Prophet (@ogbeideSmith) wrote: “That’s an old video, please not yesterday. Let’s play opposition in truth.” Godwin Obaseki is a Nigerian politician and businessman who is currently the governor of Edo State. He was first elected governor under the platform of the All Progressive Congress in the year 2016.  As such, politically inclined claims, especially about serving governors, can easily trigger unhealthy debates that may not be right when Nigeria prepares for its general election this month.  To unearth the actual context of the alleged narrative, DUBAWA subjected the video to InVid video verifier, a video verification tool that breaks videos into keyframes. Results from the analysis yielded little results, so DUBAWA then ran a keyword search of the term “Governor Obaseki disgraced” on Google search engine, which led to several results that indicated the said video to have been available online since 2019 and was shot in New York and not in Europe. For example, Linda Ikeji Blog has the story with the title “Governor Godwin Obaseki ‘disgraced’ by protesters in New York (video),” published September 25, 2019. Another platform, WowNews ran the story with the headline “Must Watch: Edo State Governor Godwin Obaseki harassed and almost beaten up by protesters in New York” and published it three years ago (2019).  The video is also available on several YouTube channels, including here, here and here, with the description showing the video was uploaded three years ago. All dates indicated three years back in 2019 and not as recently claimed.  DUBAWA dug deeper into Facebook by searching “Obaseki New York” and clicking on the video tab. Results traced a video with  the caption: “This is my Oga Tunde Olatunji chasing Obaseki out of New York back in the days of #BuhariMustGo and #freesoworenow. Bros hope you no forget anything for Edo state?🤣😅😂😆🏃🏼‍♂️🏃🏼‍♂️🏃🏼‍♂️🏃🏼‍♂️🏃🏼‍♂️”  DUBAWA turned its search on Tunde Olantuji’s page, focusing on the videos he posted on his Facebook page from September 19 to 25, 2019. This date was when Olatunji was heavily involved in protests around the Nigerian House in New York.  Interestingly, in the first live video posted by Mr Tunde on September 19, 2019, his opening lines were:  “Hi, people. This is Tunde Olantunji. I live here at the Nigeria House in New York City. Everyone is on the ground right now. The protest is starting right now,” introducing his viewers to a series of videos that will eventually follow.  The next time Mr Tunde went live in a protest was on the 24th, and it is from the second video he shared that day that the alleged footage was extracted. This Original version is a 1 hour, 5 minutes and 59 seconds Facebook live video covered by Mr Tunde during the protest in New York.  In this long and original version, Mr Obaseki walks into the frame at exactly 43 minutes and 26 seconds, with the protesters calling his name and shouting at him.  Image 3: Mr Obaseki with the blue suit and eyeglasses in a picture he posted on September 24, 2021, on Twitter (left) and Obaseki with the same suit and glasses in the video. On the 24th of 2019, Obaseki made a tweet with pictures of himself at the 74th General Assembly of the United Nations in New York, the same city the video was recorded. In the pictures accompanying his tweet, The Edo State Governor is wearing the same blue suit as in the acclaimed footage.  Also, in a Facebook live stream by Sahara Reporters on the said day, some protesters, who bear a resemblance to the ones on the acclaimed video, were seen protesting for the release of Omoyele Sowere, publisher of Sahara Reporters and current presidential candidate of the African Action Congress, AAC. It was this set of protesters who saw Obaseki and switched on to confront him in front of the Nigerian consulate In New York.  Although some protesters harassed Mr Obaseki in a foreign land, the video was not as recently claimed, and it was in New York, not somewhere in Europe as alleged. This claim is misleading.

"Claim: An alleged picture of Ebuka Uchendu, a popular TV host putting on the Tinubu signature cap as a mark of support has surfaced online.","As the election season draws nearer, political actors and their supporters continue to wish and seek celebrities’ public endorsement of their preferred candidate. This ploy has continuously stirred the waters of disinformation as many supporters have created false images and videos of celebrities to align them with certain politicians. So when a  Twitter user, Moore (@accoid), posted a picture of Ebuka Uchendu wearing a sky blue agbada with a Tinubu signature cap, suggesting that the media personality has pledged support for the candidate of the All Progressive Congress, it became controversial.  The picture was posted with the caption, “Ebuka go hear am from Obidients.” There were those who reacted to the tweet and seemed to think the image wasn’t altered. TJboss (@OyewoleAdetunji) seem to hold the picture to some credibility:  “Boy wey smart pass them,” he wrote, insinuating that Mr Ebukas’s choice to support Tinubu is a smart decision.  However, Arc AJ-Ojo (@ojoojadedapo) argued that the image was doctored and simply dubbed it photoshop. “Na photoshop though,” he wrote.  As of Monday, February 6, 2022, the tweet has garnered 34.5K views, 34 comments, 64 retweets and 339 likes.  The image has also made its way to WhatsApp and has been shared on Facebook by Prince Charles Ekanem, an aide to the Cross River State Governor. Chukwuebuka Obi-Uchendu is a Nigerian media personality from Anambra State, Nigeria. He is known for hosting the reality show Big Brother Naija and other shows, including the long-running talk show Rubbin’ Minds on Channels TV, co-hosting The Spot and Men’s Corner on Ebonylife television. Celebrity endorsement has become the poster child for politician gimmicks. So, a controversial narrative such as this one has the potential to mislead many and influence their voting decisions in upcoming elections.  To validate the veracity of the alleged picture, DUBAWA first looked through Ebuka’s images on Twitter to see if he had posted the picture on his official handle like he normally does.  However, the last image posted by Ebuka was this picture on New Year’s Eve, and the alleged image was nowhere in sight.  DUBAWA also checked through his Instagram and saw that he had posted the actual image, where the cap did not carry the Tinubu signature embroidery. He made the post on Sunday, February 5, 2023, during his appearance at the Big Brother Titans eviction shows that evening.  The actual image without Tinubu’s signature embroidery on the cap. A search through the media personality social media shows no affiliation or endorsement of any sort to any political candidate. On his Instagram, Ebuka has no recent picture with any of the candidates. A name search of the four major candidates on his Twitter showed that the last time he mentioned the name “Bola Tinubu” was in a tweet he made on December 29, 2022, and it was about the “Top 10 most fascinating Nigerians of 2022.” The list also had Rufai Oseni, a TV on Arise TV, Musicians, Oxlade, Tems, Portable and Asake.  It also had Peter Obi, the presidential candidate of the Labour Party, which was also the last time he was mentioned in any of his tweets. There is, therefore, no evidence that Ebuka has endorsed any candidate. The alleged image featuring Mr Ebuka was doctored with the Tinubu signature embroidery to indicate support. The claim is false.  ",FALSE,22/02/2023,https://dubawa.org/picture-of-ebuka-wearing-tinubus-signature-cap-doctored/
"Claim: Festus Keyamo, a spokesperson of the Tinubu/Shettima Presidential campaign council, posted an image on Twitter, claiming that the crowd in the image were from the APC’s presidential campaign in Sokoto.","Claim: Festus Keyamo, a spokesperson of the Tinubu/Shettima Presidential campaign council, posted an image on Twitter, claiming that the crowd in the image were from the APC’s presidential campaign in Sokoto. Verdict: The image used in Mr Keyamo’s tweet was deliberately distorted and taken from its original context to mislead the public. The image was originally taken at the Lollapalooza, Chicago, USA festival in 2021, not in Sokoto, Nigeria, during the APC rally. The claim is false.  As campaigns towards the general elections intensify, the use of crowds at political campaigns to show political prowess continues among actors and supporters of the top political parties. On Thursday, February 9, 2023, Barrister Festus Keyamo, Nigeria’s Junior minister of Labour and a spokesperson for the Tinubu/Shettma campaigns, shared a tweet with images purportedly from the All Progressive Congress (APC) presidential rally in Sokoto State earlier that day. Mr Keyamo shared  the image from his official Twitter handle @fkeyamo with the caption:  “More pictures from the mother of all rallies in Sokoto! The signs are all there for all to see! But they are playing! Make dem dey play!! In about a forth-night, the jungle will mature.” One of the photos that depicted a huge crowd of shirtless people seemed to draw more attention than the rest.  One user called out the image for being fake.  Sound Jay (@sound_jay6) argued that the image with shirtless people was fake; “fake picture mate,” be challenged. However, in a concession to the alleged narrative, Ketura (@ketura16647548)  also wrote: “Jungle don fully matured oh na human being be dis. Jagaban we know Jagaban we vote. Sai ka shiga villa.” The tweet has been viewed over 280K times, with over 1,654 likes and over 346 retweets. As the election date draws near, political actors are getting more desperate, which can sometimes push them to share contentious content worthy of verification. DUBAWA ran a Tin Eye reverse image search to verify the picture’s integrity. Interestingly, the analysis revealed the alleged image was originally shared by Colin Hinkle (@hinklecolin) on Twitter and dated back to July 31, 2021, when he tagged @Lollapalooza, a music festival that is held in Chicago. The image was also a subject of an article on Business Insider Africa titled: “A photo showing the mostly maskless crowd at Lollapalooza 2021 is being compared to Where’s Waldo.” DUBAWA also found that this is not the first time this image has been used to mislead the public. A Nigerian blogging site, Naijaloaded,  in one of its posts titled: “Ronaldo To Real Madrid or Messi To PSG – Which Of These Is The Biggest Transfer To Happen In Sporting History?” claimed the image was of the fans who came out in Paris to witness the arrival of the Argentina footballer Lionel Messi’s arrival to Paris Saint Germain. To further verify the alleged image and the original version, DUBAWA conducted a forensic analysis of the two images, subjecting both versions to noise analysis to determine the level of distortion on the alleged image. Results from the analysis, conducted on the same ratings (encircled red), revealed Mr Keyamo’s version (image 4)  was deliberately subjected to noise distortion to reduce the quality of the image, hence the quality of visibility.  The Lollapalooza festival is an annual four-day music festival that features artists from different genres of music and is hosted in Grand Park, Chicago, USA. Considered one of the biggest music festivals in the world. The event, which started in 1991, has had appearances from Snoop Doggy Dogg, the Prodigy, Kanye West, K’naan, J. Cole, Dua Lipa, amongst others.  The image used in Mr Keyamo’s tweet was deliberately distorted and removed from its original context to mislead the public.  The image was originally taken at the Lollapalooza festival in 2021. The claim is false.

"CLAIM: Earlier this year, a viral tweet stated that a northern Imam, Muhammad Bin Uthman, refers to the killings of Christians in southern Kaduna as “taming the infidels.” Another user of the microblogging service also shared that the cleric said all Christians should be removed from power in Nigeria.","On January 4, a Twitter user, an adherent of Peter Obi’s political movement, had quoted a popular Islamic preacher, Shaykh Muhammad Bin Uthman, to have described the terror attacks on the people of southern Kaduna, who are predominantly Christians as “taming the infidels.” “A northern Imam refers to the killings in Southern Kaduna as ‘taming the infidels’,” OyinD (@Oyinkitana), a Twitter user with over 11,000 followers, said. His tweet had over 1,000 likes and 912 retweets, while hundreds of users of the microblogging and networking service viewed it. The social media influencer used the picture of Mr Uthman — culled from a short trending video of the Imam — as evidence of the claim. “Imagine what a Muslim-Muslim ticket will do to Christians in Nigeria,” he added, urging his audience to “dey play dey go” — a local sarcastic manner of asking someone to be watchful or vigilant. Expectedly, several Twitter users who would not verify his claim expressed their views; most of them poured out their resentment over the disturbing statement attributed to the cleric. “So northern Christians from southern Kaduna are the infidels…” said Opeyemi Tunde (@Opeyemi_Tunde1), corroborating OyinD (@Oyinkitana’s claim). “We must stop this Muslim-Muslim ticket before it consumes us all.” In a similar viral tweet by yet another Twitter influencer with over 76,000 followers, Demagogue (@von_Bismack), attributed a quote to the same Imam, stating he asked that all Christians be removed from power. “All moslems should vote for the Moslem-Moslem ticket. Christians should be removed from every govt in nig; it took the servant of God, Elrufai, in Kaduna state to tame the infidels in the state [sic],” the Twitter influencer claimed, reiterating that “Shaykh Muhammad Bin Uthman Kano” said this “while endorsing Tinubu’s Moslem-Moslem ticket.” Again, this post had over 2,000 retweets and over 200,000 views, with hundreds of reactions from other Twitter users, who corroborated the claim with no factual interrogations. The Twitter user continued, “This is a popular cleric endorsing the ethnic cleansing ongoing in Kaduna state while urging Moslems to make sure that no Christian attains any elective position in Nigeria.” Both OyinD (@Oyinkitana) and Demagogue (@von_Bismack) referred to a short video that featured the cleric speaking in the Hausa language as evidence of the disturbing assertions attributed to him. All other blogs that also joined hands in disseminating the claim on the internet, including Nairaland, relied solely on the short video as the source of their information. However, the acclaimed 1:29 clip was reviewed and analysed by three independent professional Hausa translators and native speakers. All the translators consulted for this fact-check report agreed on the following transcription and translation of the video clip:  “Any of them with a Muslim-Muslim ticket is the one I should campaign for. I am not after anybody or anything. No aspirant will work for Islam. None. Even in Kaduna, God had to use a governor to tame the excesses of the nonbelievers in this state. But for you to keep shouting ‘justice.” Do they extend justice to you? Do they hide their disdain from you? “I told the Gombe people. The total number of local governments belonging to non-believers is three. But you gave them Deputy Governor. In Plateau (state), we have many Muslims, but we were denied. “Malam, do you know justice? You are ignorant; you don’t even know justice. You don’t even know the concept of justice. So, this is transformation. Go and vote wisely for transformation. Any political juggernaut has to fulfil a certain or ten-point agenda; we need security, food production, quality education, job opportunities, shelters for the citizens and healthcare delivery system, a nonepileptic power supply, and good water.” Unfortunately, both the first and second claimants took the lines of the cleric completely out of context, said the language experts contacted for this report. Mr Uthman, being an Islamic leader, was giving his congregants reasons they should vote and campaign for any political party with a Muslim-Muslim ticket. Since the presidential candidate of the All Progressive Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu, picked Kashim Shettima, a Muslim from Borno, as his running mate for the forthcoming election contest, many Nigerians, especially non-Muslims have accused him of planning to Islamise the country, a phenomenon that stirred controversies on several occasions. Following the development, many religious leaders have been canvassing for or against the Muslim-Muslim ticket. In Kaduna, where the Kano preacher made the statements now taken out of context, the state’s current governor, Nasir El-Rufai, had won the 2019 governorship election using a Muslim-Muslim ticket. Some of the state’s citizens believe his choice of deputy aggravated the tribal and religious crises battling the state. “There is no place in the quoted video where the speaker endorsed the killings of southern Kaduna Christians,” said Abdulrahman Yahya, a Hausa translator and linguist in Sokoto. Other linguists and translators contacted for this story corroborated his verdict. “And the cleric did not say Christians should be removed from power in Nigeria. That’s completely outrageous.” It is unclear to whom the cleric was referring when he said, “God had to use a governor in this state to tame the excesses of the nonbelievers.” Mr Uthman’s telephone line could not be reached for further engagement on the assertions attributed to him on Twitter. Although political pundits believe that urging congregants to choose leaders based on religion may not be the best, the Islamic cleric has not, in any contextual interpretations, described the killings of Christians of southern Kaduna as “taming the infidels.” He has also not proclaimed in the video that all Christians should be removed from government. The claims are, therefore, misleading. ",MISLEADING,21/02/2023,https://dubawa.org/fact-check-did-kano-islamic-preacher-describe-killings-of-southern-kaduna-christians-as-taming-the-infidels/
Claim: A viral post claims aphelion is responsible for changes in weather conditions.,"A post circulated on social media – particularly WhatsApp and Facebook –  claimed that Aphelion, a cosmological event, is responsible for the current weather conditions in Nigeria and other countries worldwide. It claims the weather is expected to be colder from now till March 30, 2023, because the earth will be further from the sun (Aphelion phenomenon).  It also advised the public to boost their immunity as the adverse weather conditions caused by this phenomenon might bring about respiratory diseases. It remains unclear who authored the viral post. A part of the post on WhatsApp reads, “The distance from Earth to the Sun is five light minutes or 90,000,000 km. The Aphelion phenomenon takes us 152,000,000 km away from the sun, that is, 66% further away. The air will be colder; our body is not used to this temperature, and the difference is great. We must keep our health conditions to the maximum; it does not matter if it is cloudy or sunny. The increase in the cold will feel the same!” Some Facebook users shared the same post. While some used it to inform their followers, others used it to advertise their products. Links to some of the posts are contained here, here, here and here.  Checks on the post’s comment section showed unsuspecting public members believed the content without ascertaining its veracity. This is because the post is coming amid complaints by some Nigerians over the current weather condition in the country, as can be seen here, here and here. Those resharing the post take it as a justification for the current weather issues in Nigeria. Meanwhile, DUBAWA observed that posts about the Aphelion phenomenon on Facebook had been shared repeatedly over the years.  Aphelion, in astronomy, is the point of the earth’s elliptical orbit farthest away from the sun. Conversely, Perihelion is the point in the earth’s orbit when the earth is closest to the sun.  Earth’s Aphelion is about 94.5 million miles or 152 million km from the sun, while the Perihelion is 91.4 million miles or 147 million km. Meanwhile, the earth’s average distance from the sun is 93 million miles (150 million km), also known as one astronomical unit (AU). However, as the earth orbits the sun in an elliptical path, the distance between the earth and the sun varies throughout the year. The viral WhatsApp post noted that the aphelion phenomenon causes a 66% difference in the earth’s distance from the sun. However, NASA explained that “the eccentricity of our planet’s orbit is mild; aphelion and perihelion differ from the mean Sun-Earth distance by less than 2%”.  Also, the dates for this year’s aphelion and perihelion occurrence have been predicted by Astropixels, which recorded dates for the two events from 2001 to 2100.  The respective dates for the Perihelion and aphelion occurrence are January 4, 2023, and July 6, 2023. This means the claim that aphelion was already occurring in February to last till March 2023 is incorrect.  Also, the distance from the sun doesn’t determine the seasons or weather but rather by the tilt of the earth’s axis of rotation, known as obliquity, according to a NASA report. The body noted that it is a common misconception that the earth’s varying distance from the sun is responsible for seasons but disclaimed, “In fact, the 23.5-degree tilt of our planet’s spin axis is more important. The tilt of the north pole toward the Sun in June causes summer north of the equator, while summer south of the equator comes six months later when the south pole is facing the Sun. The ellipticity of Earth’s orbit does cause a small change in solar heating from July (aphelion) to January (perihelion), but it’s not the dominant factor in shaping seasonal weather patterns.” This was also confirmed in a report by the National Geographic Society which explained that the cooling effects of more indirect sunlight cause autumn and winter in the hemisphere that is leaning away from the sun.  The claim that aphelion is responsible for changes in weather conditions is false. Instead, it is caused by the tilt of the earth’s axis.

Claim: WhatsApp message alleged the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) is moving people to other polling units to disenfranchise them.,"As election day draws closer, the pressing concern for electorates is the location of their Polling Unit (PU) and how to find it. Recently, a viral message on WhatsApp claimed that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) is moving people to polling units different from where they had registered.  The message shared on various WhatsApp groups cautioned registered voters, stating that having a PVC does not guarantee they will be allowed to vote. The message, which did not include the author’s name, reads, “Having a PVC is no longer a guarantee that you will vote. If your name has been migrated to another PU from where you’ve been used to (even if you did not request a change of location) in line with the above reason, you may not be allowed to vote there on voting day.” Registered voters were asked to follow a link provided in the body of the message to check their polling unit and share the post widely. Following the Electoral Act 2022, INEC has consistently maintained that no registered voter will be allowed to vote at a polling unit different from where they had registered; hence such a post could confuse the electorate, causing distrust in the electoral body as well as voter apathy. It is in view of this that DUBAWA deemed it necessary to fact-check the message. In June 2021, INEC created an additional 56,872 Polling Units, bringing the total number of Polling Units in Nigeria to 176,974. This was done to accommodate increasing numbers of registered voters and prevent overcrowding at polling units on election days.  In a conversation with the INEC Head of Department, Voter Education and Publicity, in Kwara State, Adamu Musa discovered that very few registered voters chose the newly created polling units.  Mr Musa explained that the Commission, in line with Section 40 (2) of the Electoral Act 2022, decided to move some registered voters from polling units with registered voters above 750 to other polling units with fewer registered voters.  He clarified that the polling units where they are being moved to are within the same constituency as the previous ones. Mr Musa stated that the measure will not disenfranchise affected registered voters as they will be duly informed and directed to the new polling units where their names were moved to. He explained further that the list of names of the affected registered voters would be pasted at the wards for them to confirm their polling units before Election Day. Mr Musa added that there would be adequate publicity in the media to ensure that the information reaches the persons concerned and other stakeholders. This development was also confirmed in a post by INEC on its verified Twitter handle where it assured affected registered voters that they would be duly informed by its State Offices on the polling units assigned to them. The electoral body also announced that elections would not be held in 240 polling units across the country because no voter registered or took transfer there due to insecurity.  DUBAWA also verified the link in the message and found it original to INEC, as voters can use this to confirm their polling unit.  Our verification revealed that although the Independent National Electoral Commission is allotting new polling units to some electorates, it is not to disenfranchise them but to ensure that the newly created polling units do not record zero votes and overcrowding is avoided on Election Day. This is to enable registered voters to perform their civic duty with ease.

"Mr Tinubu, the All Progressives Congress presidential candidate, spoke on his economic agenda and plans for tackling core issues beleaguering the Nigerian economy if elected as Nigeria’s president.","Mr Tinubu, the All Progressives Congress presidential candidate, spoke on his economic agenda and plans for tackling core issues beleaguering the Nigerian economy if elected as Nigeria’s president. Former governor of Lagos State and presidential hopeful Bola Tinubu was recently a guest at the Summit House, the head office of the Nigerian Economic Summit Group (NESG).  Mr Tinubu spoke at the NESG presidential dialogue, a platform for informed engagements with presidential candidates on the current state of the economy.  Mr Tinubu, the All Progressives Congress presidential candidate, spoke on his economic agenda and plans for tackling core issues beleaguering the Nigerian economy if elected as Nigeria’s president.  Due to the wide circulation of Mr Tinubu’s claim by the mainstream media and its potential consequence on the electorates’ decision, it is pertinent that DUBAWA fact-checks his claims. Claim: Lagos State is the fifth largest economy in Africa. Verification: In its 2021 report, the Lagos Bureau of Statistics revealed that Lagos’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was N26.5 trillion, an equivalent of $59.7 billion, using the official exchange rate of N445.  Data released by the world bank shows that Nigeria is the biggest economy in Africa, with a $440 billion GDP. South Africa’s GDP stood at $419.9 billion; Egypt’s $404 billion; Algeria’s $167.9; Morocco’s $142.8; Ethiopia’s $111.2 billion; Kenya’s $110 billion; Ghana’s $77.5 billion; Cote d’Ivoire’s $69.7 billion; Tanzania $67.8 billion; and Angola $67.4 billion. With a $59.7 million GDP, Lagos ranked 12th in Africa. Therefore, there are no facts to clearly state that Lagos State is the fifth largest economy in Africa, as Mr Tinubu claimed. Verdict: False Source: World Bank and Lagos State Bureau of Statistics Claim: Lagos State generated N600 million in revenue in 1999.  Verification: Budgit shows that Lagos generated Internally generated Revenue (IGR) of N14.6 billion in 1999, representing a monthly average of N1.2 billion.   However, when Mr Tinubu left office in 2007, the figure rose to N83.02 billion, a monthly average of N6.9 billion. Between 1999 and 2007, the IGR growth rate of Lagos stood at 468.63 per cent, showing a considerable increase. No data supports the claim that Lagos was generating N600 million in 1999. Verdict: False. Source: Budgit Claim: Lagos State is generating over 50 billion a month.   Verification: Latest data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) stated that in 2021 Lagos state generated N753 billion in IGR, representing 40 per cent of the total IGR generated by 36 states federation that year.  The statistical office said this in its 2021 IGR report published in 2022.  Similarly, in 2020, Nigeria’s commercial hub generated N660 billion and N646 billion in 2019.  This means Lagos State generated an average of N56 billion every month between 2019 and 2021. Verdict: True Source: National Bureau of Statistics Claim: The vast majority of Nigerians are young.  Verification: With a population estimated at 206 million in 2020, Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa and seventh in the world.  The country’s population is growing at 2.6% annually, one of the fastest rates globally. At this rate, Nigeria’s population could double within the next 25 to 30 years.  The country has the largest population of youth in the world, with a median age of 18.1 years. About 70% of the population is under 30, and 42% are under 15, according to Worldometer’s elaboration of the latest United Nations data.

"Claim: Peter Obi, the Labour Party (LP) presidential candidate, said Nigeria has a higher infant mortality rate than India.","Mr Obi recently said Nigeria surpasses India in infant mortality rate. He spoke while reacting to statements by the opposition that the LP, under which Mr Obi is contesting, has no structure which would facilitate his victory at the forthcoming elections.  In his response, the presidential candidate said he is determined to dismantle the existing structure that has destroyed and brought the country to a position where it has a higher infant mortality rate than India.  “It is the structure that produced 133 million people living in poverty, 20 million out-of-school children, and made Nigeria surpass India in infant mortality,” he said.  The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) defines infant mortality as the death of an infant before their first birthday, while the infant mortality rate is the number of infant deaths for every 1,000 live births.  According to the World Health Organization, the infant mortality rate goes a long way to reflect the social, economic and environmental conditions in which children (and others in society) live, including their health care. Infant mortality is a major health challenge that has received interventions from concerned health bodies, including the WHO and UNICEF.  While researchers have identified accurate measurement and estimation issues in aggregating data on infant mortality, the Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality of Estimation (UN IGME) produces trends of infant mortality rates with a standardised methodology by a group of countries depending on the type and quality of the source of data available. It draws members from the WHO, World Bank, UN Population Division and Unicef.  In the recent data released by the UN IGME, Nigeria’s infant mortality rate was 71 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2021. For India, a South-Asian country, the infant mortality rate recorded in 2021 was 25 deaths per 1,000 live births. The total estimates by Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) showed that sub-Saharan Africa suffered the highest rates of mortality in the world at 50 (46-57) deaths per 1,000 live births, about 12 times higher than the infant mortality rate in Southern Asia, which recorded 30 (28-33) deaths per 1000 live births in 2021. Using data from the World Bank, Nigeria’s population in the year under review (2021) was 213 million, while India had about 1.41 billion people. Despite the difference in the two countries’ populations, Nigeria surpassed India in infant mortality rate. In November 2022, Osagie Ehanire, Nigeria’s minister of health, blamed the lack of access to healthcare for the country’s high maternal, infant and under-five mortality. Generally, the WHO notes that infectious diseases, including pneumonia, diarrhoea and malaria, pre-term birth complications, birth asphyxia, trauma and congenital anomalies, remain the leading causes of death for children under five.   Mr Obi’s claim that Nigeria’s mortality rate is higher than India’s is true.  The claim for this fact-check was sourced using the Full Fact AI tool. Learn more about the tool here.

Claim: A viral video on social media platforms alleged the invasion of the National Assembly complex by operatives of DSS eleven days before the 2023 General Election.,"On February 14, 2023, social media platforms in Nigeria were washed with a video of heavily armed masked security operatives believed to be members of the Department of State Service (DSS) barricading the entrance of the National Assembly complex, Abuja.  The viral video shows a male member of the House of Assembly visibly angry and questioning the authority of the security operatives who said they were acting based on an “order from above.” In Nigeria, “order from above” connotes that the directive was given by a superior command, possibly from the presidency. The man in the video could be heard asking, “Order from above? What above? What happened to the above? Are they above the God that put them there? Is that what you called for? Do you call for this kind of change? This impunity of the highest order! You closed Nigeria house?” In the one-minute, 35 seconds video, the masked armed operatives could be seen taking positions in front of the National Assembly. In contrast, some other people, presumably journalists and staff of the National Assembly, were seen recording the happenings with their mobile phones. The video has been seen on Facebook, WhatsApp, TikTok, Twitter, and other social media news platforms. On Facebook, within seven hours of its upload by LadyK Ifeoluwa, the video has been viewed 44,000 times, had 1,400 shares, 330 comments and was liked 1,000 times.  On WhatsApp, concerned relatives shared it in groups and sent to individuals.  On TikTok, it was shared by @paulthegudguy” with the video having 34 likes and three comments at the time it was viewed.  On Twitter, the video was shared by @sasakosaChief. He also referenced a news platform (NewsRescue), which uploaded the video wrapping it around a narrative that the military had taken over the National Assembly. The NewsRescue platform seems not credible as no name of the publisher and correspondent were provided — no telephone number or address except an email address associated with the editor. The timing of this video and the varying narratives is dangerous, especially as the DSS recently questioned Femi Fani Kayode over a post on his verified Twitter handle @realFFK suggesting that some notable Nigerians are planning a coup. No doubt, the video can cause panic, fuel unrest in parts of the country and can prevent registered voters from coming out on election day to exercise their franchise. Due to the virality of the video, its implication on our democratic system and its potential to destabilise the country at a time when the nation is preparing for another general election, DUBAWA finds verifying the report crucial.  A keyphrase search on the web revealed that the video had been uploaded since 2018. The two minutes, 37 seconds video was shared by Channels Television on YouTube on August 7, 2018, and has 76,463 views.   The same video was also uploaded on Channels Television Facebook page on the same day, with the post having 203,000 views and being shared 6,200 times.  On YouTube, the news platform wrote that “the masked security operatives and officials of the Department of State Service (DSS) arrived at the National Assembly very early on Tuesday morning, barricading the entrance to the complex.” Coincidentally, the fake story also began circulating on a Tuesday, but this time on February 14, 2023. We also found the same video on another YouTube channel, Chosenozo, uploaded on the same day (August 7, 2018) with 51,989 views. The video is a more extended version (11 minutes, 15 seconds real-time recording). The originator of the video intentionally put out an abridged version of this video from 2018 to mislead the public.  It is important also to note that the video is being shared when members of the National Assembly are on recess in preparation for the 2023 General Election beginning on February 25th.   The legislators proceeded on recess on January 25, 2023, and are billed to resume on February 28, three days after the Presidential and National Assembly election scheduled for February 25, 2023. Although many social media users believed the story and went on to share it, some social media users were quick to point out that the video was an old one. At the same time, some of them said they were within the National Assembly’s premises on the day when the fake news popped up. Our verification shows that the video is not recent because it happened in 2018, and the National Assembly was in recess when it was shared. Therefore, the claim that the Department of State Security operatives, DSS, have hijacked the National Assembly is misleading.

"Claim: A TikTok account Okey Dubai (@okeydubai1), shared a video of a building on fire that is alleged to be the Central Bank of Nigeria branch in Benin, Edo State.","On Wednesday, February 8, amid the naira scarcity that has stretched many Nigerians thin, a TikTok account Okey Dubai (@okeydubai1), shared a video of a fire burning from a building with a thick pillar of smoke as passersby wailed at the situation. The TikToker alleged that the incident was happening live at the Central Bank Branch in Benin State. In the clip, a voice behind the camera could be heard mourning the hopeless situation.  The video was captioned alongside the statement:  “Central Bank of Nigeria, Benin on fire. It’s happening live today. 8/2/2023.” Hours after the video was shared, it went viral. As of the time of writing this report, it has had 14,000 shares with over 17,000 likes. This is understandable as news about the apex bank, naira designs, bank transfers, and cash have been trending lately since the CBN announced the phasing out old N1000, N500, and N200 notes. The problem of naira scarcity began after people had deposited their cash in line with the first January 31 deadline, only to be told it had been extended, making many scrambles for whatever new notes were in circulation.  The time sensitivity of the video stirred massive reactions from people on TikTok. While some people felt it was accurate information and bashed CBN for the scarcity of naira, others point out that the video was from another event unconnected with the apex bank branch in  A TikToker, Hauwa (@hauwaidris33), argued that the location was not in Benin city but in Abuja: “This one is next cash and carry Abuja, not Benin.” Those who countered the video were lost in the din of people who ran with it as the false description fitted their sentiments. User (@user9249885215630) = believed the fire was an act of revolt against the cashless policy of the apex bank: “It’s wartime. Let them know CBN. ABUJA IS NEXT.” On the other hand, @Splash had a comical and subtle reaction that pointed to the cash scarcity in the country. The TikToker said: “Make person no burn my money o.” Claims as such have the potential to trigger nationwide crises based on the hardship Nigerians are passing through due to naira scarcity. To track the earliest appearance of the alleged video online, DUBAWA employed the InVID video verification tool. Frames of the footage were collected, and a Google reverse image was conducted on some of them. The analysis results reveal the video was first shared by a YouTube page, My Wisdom TV – Divine Grace. This version was shared in 2019 without the layered words on the TikTok version. It had the same wailing voice, “Oh my God!” as in the TikTok video, but the narrative was entirely different.  The YouTube version, apparently the original version, captioned the video: “Next cash and carry owned by Peter Obi is on fire, trending in Abuja,” showing moments the Next Cash and Carry complex was ravaged by fire in 2021, Abuja.  Below are screenshots that show similarities in both videos. Note that what separates the original from the fake are the imposed words. Google Search was also used to find similar videos of the fire incident online. Using the keywords “next cash and carry fire,” the result brought up many news items and YouTube videos of the fire. Following a Channels TV News YouTube link, a similar video popped up. Many elements of similarities, like the Next Cash and Carry sign, were noticeable in the video. Several other news platforms like the Vanguard, People’s Gazette, and BBC News reported that the event occurred in Abuja and was at Next Cash and Carry building. Google Maps was also employed to pick out similar elements in the video and compare them to the satellite view of the event scene. The result revealed that the moving vehicle shooting the video was on Ahmadu Bellow Way opposite the Next Cash and Carry building.  Below is another screenshot that captured the road network around the mall. A similar roundabout, as seen in the video, is circled in red:  A collage screenshot of the alleged video and the satellite image shows they both had a fence beside the road leading to the scene, which was identified as Ahmadu Bello Way. Google geo-location further revealed the billboard that was at the junction. Despite the fact that they both have different banners, the placement and structure of the billboard remained the same. While the claimant alleged that the Benin CBN fire took place on February 8, 2022, the original video version said otherwise and was shared in 2021.  The alleged video used by a TiKtok user to depict a recent fire outbreak at the CBN branch in Benin, Edo state, is false. The video depicts moments when the Next Cash and Carry shopping complex was ravaged by a fire incident in Abuja in 2021.

"Claim: A viral tweet asserts that the Central Bank of Nigeria has ordered the shutdown of Opay, Kuda, and Palmpay.","Amid the new naira note controversy, a viral tweet by Olamide (@DymanFocus)  suggests that the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Governor Godwin Emefiele, has ordered the shutdown of OPay, Kuda and Palmpay offices in Nigeria with immediate effect starting from February 16, 2023. This made many Nigerians panic, and without verification, people started removing their monies from the said banks and sharing with family and friends on WhatsApp and groups on Facebook to do the same.  The vitality of this claim and the delicate nature of the Naira issue prompted us to verify it because this kind of tweet can lead to fear, unrest and cause panic for people using any of the said banks. Going through the post, we found that in a follow-up thread, the Twitter user @dymanfocus noted that his source was “expired weed and loud.” This was a major red flag.  We discovered that the original tweet was later deleted.  DUBAWA visited the website of CBN but did not find any on this or anything related.  A keyword search also shows this is not in the news. We found a disclaimer by Opay on its verified handle on Instagram @opay.ng.  “Our attention has been drawn to a post (tweet) making rounds across social media platforms about Opay. The post mentioning the CBN shitting down our operations is false and misleading to the general public,” the disclaimer reads.    The official Twitter page for Palmpay Nigeria @palmpay Nigeria has also debunked the rumour assuring Nigerians that they are still in operation and reliable.  Our finding shows that the post is false. We found no press release or news story corroborating the claim, and the Twitter user deleted the tweet.

The candidates present at the debate include Adeniran Olajide of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), who is popularly known as Jandor, and Olufunsho Doherty of the African Democratic Congress (ADC). Others are Gbadebo Rhodes-Vivour of the Labour Party (LP) and Taofeek Uthman of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), and Akin Braithwaite of the National Rescue Movement (NRM).

The debate was broadcasted on Newscentral TV and Lagos Talks FM from 6 p.m. and streamed live on Facebook and YouTube.  Kunle Lawal, the Executive Director of The Electoral College Nigeria, in the statement, said the debate would provide the platform for the candidates to discuss their ideas for the state. As expected, most of the candidates made several claims which may or may not be true, false, or just plain exaggeration.  Here are fact checks conducted by DUBAWA to ascertain what is true and what is not out of the barrage of information shared during the debate:  CLAIM: Kunle Uthman, the governorship candidate for the Social Democratic Party, said the environmental impact assessment of Eko Atlantic shows it was a wrong decision.

Claim: Old photos were recently reshared online depicting massive turnout for the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate Bola Tinubu’s campaign in Katsina.,"On February 25, Nigerians will head to the polls to elect their next president. The position of the number one Nigerian citizen will be keenly contested by 18 candidates registered with the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). Ahead of the much-awaited elections, political parties and their supporters are intensifying efforts to garner support for their candidates.  It has become a competition among political parties and their supporters over whose rally attracted more crowds, as such is often equated to massive acceptance by members of the public.  While this does not necessarily translate to getting more votes in the election, party supporters have, over time, taken to Twitter and other social media platforms to share pictures of political rallies in different states, praising the turnout for their preferred candidates and mocking the opponents who do not get such an audience. In their seeming desperation to prove a point, some supporters have resorted to sharing old photos or videos to depict turnout in 2023 rallies, thereby misleading members of the public.  An instance of this is the All Progressives Congress (APC) rally in Katsina state on February 6, 2023. Dogo Shettima, a special assistant to Babagana Zulum, the governor of Borno State, recently shared pictures from the Katsina rally on his Twitter handle.  He commented that Mr Tinubu, the presidential candidate of the APC, got a massive turnout in Katsina because of the support from Mr Buhari, an indigene of the state.  “Wetin my eyes see for Katsina my mouth no fit talk am……… @officialABAT is lucky to Have Allah and @MBuhari on his side. Katsina state has proven @MBuhari is theirs (sic),” he wrote as a caption to support pictures showing President Buhari in a vehicle and through with many supporters.  The pictures were also shared by other supporters of the APC, as seen here, here and here.  However, some of the pictures are not recent, according to DUBAWA’s findings.  DUBAWA subjected the images to reverse image search tools to check the origin of the image and the first time it was shared.  Results from Google reverse image search showed that some of the images had been captured in 2019 during Mr Buhari’s campaign in Katsina in February 2019.  Mr Shettima appeared to have deliberately mixed the pictures with others from the 2023 rally in Katsina to confuse unsuspecting members of the public. The governor’s aide did not differentiate the pictures to show some were old while others were recent – which would have given proper context to his post. The photos were contained in a report by TheCable newspaper featuring the president campaigning for a second term for himself and Aminu Masari as governor of the state.  Part of the photos shared from the Katsina rally for Mr Tinubu, presidential candidate of the APC, was captured in 2019 during Mr Buhari’s rally in the state.

Claim: A viral letter accredited to the Finland government issued a 48-hour ultimatum to Simon Ekpa to desist from encouraging Nigerians to boycott the election.,"Simon Ekpa, a Nigerian-Finish and factional leader of the outlawed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), has been at the forefront of the Biafran agitation.  He had repeatedly declared sit-at-home orders across the South-east, insisting there would be no election in the region in 2023. On Tuesday, February 14, 2023, the Finnish Ambassador to Nigeria, Leena Pylvanainen, was summoned by Nigeria’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs over threats by Biafra agitator Simon Ekpa to stop the 2023 general election in Nigeria’s south-east. Following this, the image of a letter warning Mr Ekpa accredited to the Finland Government went viral Thursday, February 16, 2023.  According to the letter, Finland’s prime minister purportedly gave a 48-hour ultimatum to Simon Ekpa, a Nigerian-Finish headliner in the Southeast Biafra agitation, to desist from encouraging Nigerians to boycott the upcoming general elections. It was shared by Adamu Garba, the Deputy Director, Media of the All Progressives Congress, Independent Presidential Campaign Council (APC PCC), noting Mr Ekpa is on his way to the Nigerian prison. Mr Garba’s post shared nine hours ago has garnered 139,000 views, 723 likes, 225 retweets and 57 quotes. This letter was also made to Facebook, where Enugu Journalist, The STATE of Biafra, VoiceofBiafra, and Mahakwe Ndi Igbo shared it. The vitality of this post and the sensitive nature of the issue called for verification. The Government of Finland has disowned the letter attributed to its prime minister, Sanna Marin, purportedly asking the Nigerian-Finish lawyer to withdraw some controversial comments about the upcoming Nigerian general elections. Finland’s Ambassador to Nigeria, Leena Pylvänäinen, in a phone interview with PREMIUM TIMES, on Thursday, said, “it is a complete fake but unfortunately has spread very widely sadly.” PREMIUM TIMES also spotted the inconsistency in how Mr Ekpa’s last name was spelt.  In the salutation, it was correctly written as “Ekpa”, but in the body, it was written as “Ikpa”.  The uncivil tone of the letter was also among other features that discredited the letter. Ms Pylvänäinen noted that her team had been busy trying to correct this false information. The first tweet was taken down by Twitter when they were alerted by authorities in Helsinki, Finland. “Sadly, retweets and screenshots now appear on different media,” she said, adding that it was sad that many media houses had taken the letter at face value and distributed it. Ms Pylvänäinen reiterated that both countries (Finland and Nigeria) have been in communication regarding Mr Ekpa. She noted that Finland, as part of the EU, attaches importance to the upcoming Nigeria election and is committed to supporting the authorities to ensure they are carried out safely and securely in all parts of the country. “This is very much a shared interest and concern, and we do not condone any violence or incitement to violence or any calls to stop the election. That is, of course, unacceptable,” Ms Pylvänäinen said. The viral letter attributed to the government of Finland warning Simon Ekpa is false as it did not originate from the Government of Finland.

"Claim: A Twitter user Ifedolapo Osun – in a viral tweet – shared a video announcement that Bola Tinubu, the presidential candidate of All Progressive Congress, is set to marry a second wife on Saturday, February 18.","A viral jingle announcement on social media platforms claimed Bola Tinubu, the presidential candidate of All Progressive Congress, is purportedly taking a second wife on Saturday, February 18. The video announcement stated that Mr Tinubu is billed to marry Khadija Abubakar Wagini in central mosque Katsina state. A picture of Mr Tinubu and Mrs Wagini was merged to suggest pre-wedding moments. Governor Aminu Masari of Katsina state was said to represent Ms Wagini at the scheduled event, while the governor of Kano state represents Mr Tinubu. Business mogul Dahiru Mangal was said to be the chief host. “Tinubu is set to marry a Northern wife,” Twitter user Ifedolapo Osun wrote on February 11, exactly two weeks before Nigeria’s presidential elections. “For you to know how desperate Tinubu is concerning Northern votes, he’s set to marry a northerner this Saturday in Katsina,” the tweet reads. “Meanwhile, some people will say Yoruba ronu, Why is Tinubu leaving your sister to marry a NORTHERNER???” The tweets would soon go viral on social media a few hours later, with some massively engaging the claims. By February 16, the tweet had reached 114,000 people on Twitter, and 18,000 people had watched the video. On February 12, a day after Mr Osun’s tweet, another Twitter user @Spotlight_Abby, shared the video tweeting: “Is this a joke or something? Guess who is allegedly set to marry a sisi baby from Katsina in a desperate bid to secure Northern votes? E no fit recite prayers, na this one e go fit do?

I mean, should Northwestern folks rejoice and cast their vote for this or what?

Nigerians will elect a new president and federal lawmakers on February 25, while state elections will be held on March 11. Mr Tinubu, a former governor of Lagos state, is the candidate of the ruling party for the presidential election. Bayo Onanuga, the Director of Media and Publicity of the Tinubu campaign council, debunked claims that Mr Tinubu is getting married. “It’s fake news,” Mr Onanuga said, adding, “Tinubu is not taking a second wife.

Claim: A viral post on Instagram by The Shaderoom posited that a study revealed links between UV nail polish dryers and cancer-causing mutations in cells.,"As more women explore different fashion options to appear beautiful, getting a ‘manicure or pedicure in line with the latest trends completes the look in most cases. However, some tools or equipment used by nail designers might pose a danger to their health. Recently, The Shaderoom (@Shaderoom), on Instagram, posted that a study by researchers disclosed that UV nail polish dryers could be linked with skin cancer. The post has been viewed by over 300,000 Instagram users and has had over 30,000 comments since filing this report. The average woman gets a manicure or pedicure done at intervals of two weeks, depending on the work the individual is engaged in. These days more women opt for gel polish or acrylic nails because they are fancier and last longer. These nails require UV light to dry up properly, and more young women prefer this option. According to a survey by Statista, 12 per cent of 18 to 29-year-olds apply nail polish multiple times a week, compared to just six per cent of those aged 60 and over. Around 27 per cent of 60-year-olds and above said they never use nail polish, implying that the younger demography uses nail polish more. Seeing this tool is a part of many people’s beauty routines and the possible health consequences prompted us to verify this assertion shared by The Shaderoom and other users. According to a new research article by a group of dermatologists, Ultraviolet A light is commonly emitted by UV-nail polish dryers suggesting that long-term use may increase the risk of developing skin cancer. However, they added that there is no experimental evaluation to reveal the effect of radiation emitted by UV-nail polish dryers on mammalian cells. The Washington Post reports that researchers at the University of California at San Diego and the University of Pittsburgh exposed humans. Mice cell lines to UVA light from nail dryers and findings showed that after a single 20-minute exposure, 20 to 30 per cent of the cells died, and after three consecutive 20-minute exposures, 65 to 70 per cent of the cells died. Furthermore, the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) affirmed that using nail drying lamps in manicure processes is low risk. However, they advised users to desist from using these lamps if they have concerns. ",TRUE,15/02/2023,https://dubawa.org/true-studies-show-uv-nail-polish-dryers-increase-skin-cancer-risks/
"Claim: A Twitter page, in an attempt to make a sarcastic comparison, alleged that a photo of some young men is Lobi Stars Football Club players sitting in front of a priest at an open ground during their seminar.","On Thursday, January 12, 2023, a Twitter page, “Nigerian Football League – Reporter” (@LeaguesReporter), shared collaged pictures of Remo Stars and Lobi Stars football clubs to highlight the stark difference in terms of how the two teams are managed. While the upper photo had Remo stars players in a well-lit room with their jerseys on, the snap portraying Lobi Stars shows players in an open rough-looking environment with people in motley clothes sitting before a priest in a white cloak. The Twitter account captioned the photo: “Remo Stars players seminar vs Lobi Stars Football Club of Makurdi players seminar. Many clubs in Nigeria don’t know the power of branding; they run their clubs like  street football cooperatives, SHAME.” The tweet stirred massive reactions on the social media platform and gathered over 100 retweets and hundreds of likes while writing this fact-check. It became a centre of discussion of everything wrong with Nigeria football clubs as people used Lobi stars as an apt example of how a team should not be run.   While many threw jabs at the club, a few picked holes in the claim, saying the account misrepresented the team in a bad light with the photo used. A Twitter user, Osinachi Leonard (@bronze_voice,) wrote: “This ‘branding’ in some Nigeria football teams has to be improved… In secondary school, some people no pay attention to this topic, now they are in charge of big roles and can’t run them properly (sic).” Another Twitter user, Sowole (@SowoleMoshood1), who called out the photo of Lobi stars as fake, argued:  “Why should you call this a Seminar? This is the prayer section for Lobi Stars. And Remo Stars own is a seminar. Don’t criticize Lobi Stars. It’s two different scenarios.” The alleged narrative was also shared on Facebook by a page that belongs to the same @LeaguesReporter (Nigerian Football League). See screenshots below: Lobi Stars Football Club is a Nigerian professional soccer club based in Makurdi, Benue, founded in 1981. The club competes in the Nigerian Professional Football League. The Stars’ home is the 8,000 seater Aper Aku Stadium in Makurdi, Benue state. Remo Stars Football Club is a professional football club based in Ikenne, Ogun State, Nigeria, founded in 2010. The club competes in the Nigeria Professional Football League and is known as the Sky Blue Stars. Nigerian Football has been heavily criticised for poor funding, branding and quality facilities. This alleged tweet, especially coming from a Twitter handle that claims to: “we specialise in bringing the best out of  Nigerian leagues and projecting it to the world on a positive note” has the potential to further damage the fading image of the Nigerian Soccer league.  To check the veracity of the alleged photos about the alleged narrative, DUBAWA conducted a reverse image search of the pictures. The results traced similar photos on the Lobi Stars’ official Facebook page.  A similar photo with a priest and a retinue of people taken from another angle was shared as part of their photo album during a seminar held in January 2023.  There are so many things in the photos that show they are the same. The date marked out in the footnote of the pictures showed they were taken on the same January 11, 2023. The man sitting before them is on a blue chair. The priest is also in white. A section of the post, as seen in the screenshot below, mentioned that a reverend father, Emmanuel Asue, prayed for a good outing for the players ahead of the 2023 NPFL season.  Among the photos also shared was another one showing the players in a class setting (all dressed in their jerseys) with writing materials. It was revealed that they were being taken on “the laws of the game” by a seasoned Nigerian referee, Iyorhe Ephraim Shaagba. As it appears, the alleged photo used to push the comparative narrative only represented a prayer event organised as one of the activities during the seminar.  Just like Remo Stars, Lobi Stars also had their tactical team meeting in an enclosed hall fairly up to standard.   The comparison is portrayed by an online that claims to share positive news about the Nigerian soccer league.  Fact-checking such a claim became important as poor management, branding, and corruption have been said to be facing the Nigerian football league. However, shreds of evidence revealed that the photo widely shared on social media platforms as a wholesome representative of Lobi stars’ seminar is misleading as it was just a prayer session held as part of the events billed for the occasion. Hence, the claim is misleading.  ",MISLEADING,13/02/2023,https://dubawa.org/viral-photo-of-lobi-stars-football-club-players-at-seminar-misleading/
"Claim: A viral video says US president Joe Biden condemned male transgenders, saying they can never be women.","A video which has now gone viral on social media claimed Biden, US president, condemned transgender males. In the clip, he said they can never be women. The video captured the president using cuss words against them.  The video uploaded on YouTube recently showed the president giving a speech from the White House with the US flag behind him.  A keyword search on YouTube popped up another video with the exact audio but with a still photograph of the US President making the statement. The video has been watched over 1,800 times and has elicited several comments.  The video had been shared on WhatsApp with many resharing, indicating they believe its content.

The search result showed that the video was a deepfake as most models were given above 90% in detecting the manipulation.    To ascertain the origin of the video, DUBAWA further made use of the Invid Verification plugin to know where else the video appeared online and the exact context in which it was used.  DUBAWA further subjected the keyframes of the video, brought up by INVID, to reverse image searches and was directed to the original video. The original video on the Economic Times website showed Mr Biden speaking in Washington about the plans by the United States to send 31 M1 Abrams battle tanks to Ukraine. The video, attributed to the Associated Press, was released on January 26, 2023.  DUBAWA observed that the exact setting in the video with the United States flags in the background and the suit the president was wearing with a matching tie were the same as the one in the viral video.  A further search on Google using the text from the supposed speech showed that the statement is a copypasta: an internet slang for a block of text copied and pasted across the Internet by individuals through online forums and social networking websites.  The “You will never be a woman” comment is said to have evolved with different variants of the message online. One such was posted on 4Chan, a controversial imageboard website as far back as 2011. A modified version of the text (now deleted) was traced to Reddit about two years ago, containing the exact words used in the viral video. Meanwhile, Mr Biden, according to news sources, has shown solidarity with the LGBTQI+ community rather than condemn them as the video suggests. In his speech on the Transgender Day of Remembrance 2022, Biden reiterated that his administration is “committed to strengthening the rights of LGBTQI+ Americans, including transgender Americans.” The viral video claiming Biden condemned male transgenders is false.

"On January 26, 2023, the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) presidential candidate, Rabiu Kwankwaso, spoke at Daily Trust’s annual dialogue on his blueprint and how he intends to govern Nigeria if elected.","On January 26, 2023, the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) presidential candidate, Rabiu Kwankwaso, spoke at Daily Trust’s annual dialogue on his blueprint and how he intends to govern Nigeria if elected. Mr Kwankwaso, a former minister of defence, expressed concern about how crude oil theft in Nigeria is undermining production and consequently affecting the country’s revenue generation. The ex-senator made some claims regarding Nigeria’s oil quota and production. But, how true is Mr Kwankwaso’s claims on the oil output of Africa’s largest oil producer? Claim: Nigeria produces less than one million barrels of crude oil daily. Verification: A review of data obtained from the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) shows that from October to December 2022, Nigeria’s oil output was above one million barrels per day. In October, Nigeria’s average production was 1.014 million barrels per day. The output turnout increased to 1.1 million barrels per day in November.  By December, Africa’s largest oil producer pumped 1.2 million barrels daily. OPEC uses secondary sources to monitor its oil output and publishes a table of figures submitted by its member countries. The Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC), in its monthly oil production status report, corroborated the same data published by OPEC. Verdict: False. OPEC monthly oil market report and NUPRC monthly production report. Claim: Mr Kwankwaso claimed that Nigeria’s oil production quota is more than 2.2 million barrels per day. Verification: Throughout the past year (2022), the average production quota set by OPEC for  Nigeria is 1.6 million barrels per day. In January, at the start of 2022, Nigeria’s quota stood at 1.68 million barrels per day. By February, the OPEC quota had increased to 1.7 million barrels daily.  By March, as the price of crude jumped to $113 per barrel, OPEC also increased Nigeria’s quota to 1.71 million barrels per day. Although oil prices dropped to $105 in April, OPEC increased Nigeria’s required production to 1.73 million daily barrels. With some companies shutting production in May, the average OPEC quota for Nigeria that month was 1.75 million barrels per day.  By June, the OPEC basket price had climbed again to $118 per barrel, and OPEC’s required production increased to 1.77 million barrels per day. In July, Nigeria’s quota stood at 1.79 million barrels. Meanwhile, between August and December 2022, Nigeria’s required production set by OPEC is 1.8 million barrels per day. Verdict: False. OPEC data shows that Nigeria’s oil production quota is 1.7 million barrels throughout  the year 2022. Conclusion The claims made by Kwankwanso that Nigeria’s oil output is less than one million barrels per day and the oil production quota is more than 2.2 million barrels per day are false. Data shows that Nigeria produced an average of 1.1 million barrels between October and December last year. Similarly, Nigeria’s oil production quota is 1.7 million barrels throughout 2022. The researcher produced this fact-check per the DUBAWA 2023 Kwame Karikari Fellowship partnership with Premium Times to facilitate the ethos of truth in journalism and enhance media literacy in the country.

"Claim: Using the name of Ibrahim Babangida, Nigeria’s former military leader, a Twitter user – in a series of viral tweets – showed support for former president Olusegun Obasanjo’s public endorsement of Peter Obi, the presidential candidate of the Labour Party.","On January 1, former president Olusegun Obasanjo wrote another long epistle as he would usually do on public matters. Many Nigerians wondered what the man of many letters had to say this time.  Mr Obasanjo addressed the electorate, especially the youth, in a new year letter ahead of the forthcoming general election; he also endorsed Peter Obi of the Labour Party saying, Obi is the most appropriate presidential candidate to succeed the incumbent president,  Muhammadu Buhari. “None of the contestants is a saint, but when one compares their character, antecedent, understanding, knowledge, discipline, and vitality that they can bring to bear and the great efforts required to stay focused on the job, particularly looking at where the country is today and with the experience on the job that I personally had, Peter Obi as a mentee has an edge,” Mr Obasanjo wrote in his open letter to young Nigerians. But Mr Obasanjo received knocks from opposition parties following his public endorsement of Mr Obi. Supporters of Bola Tinubu, the presidential candidate of the All Progressive Congress (APC), and Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) accused Mr Obasanjo of planning to achieve his third term ambition by endorsing Mr Obi. They said the former president’s endorsement of any candidate is worthless. However, on January 2, 2023, following the controversy that trailed Mr Obasanjo’s endorsement, a Twitter account purported to be that of a former military president, Ibrahim Babangida, was used to release several tweets showing solidarity with Mr Obasanjo over his endorsement of the LP presidential candidate. The tweets would soon go viral on social media, with unscrupulous persons engaging the claims massively.  “I am not against any political party or any political candidate; however, if the reason you want to attain the role of leadership is because you think it’s your turn; or it should remain in a certain geo-political zone. You don’t have my support. I am who I am,” the Twitter user claimed Mr Babangida said. In another instance, the Twitter thread also reads: “Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo will forever be a true elder statesman and a boss in the military. No serving General in the Nigerian Army today joined the military earlier than 1982. By then, Obasanjo had already finished his military career. I respect him a lot, with his endorsement.” A few days after, over 20,000 Twitter users liked the tweets, and over 5,000 retweeted, while more than 800,000 accounts generally viewed the posts. DUBAWA observed that hundreds of Twitter users, primarily supporters of Mr Obi’s presidential ambition, embraced the tweets from the cloned account, praising the two former military heads for endorsing their candidate while sharing their comments on the tweets attributed to Mr Babangida. “A general is always a general. That’s the standard,” said Salim Ado Abdullahi (@salim_ado), a Twitter user. “Our elder statesman has spoken,” Garkuwa Umar (@garkuwa_umar), another supporter of Mr Obi, wrote, corroborating. Many comments under the tweets came similarly.  Interestingly, cross-checking the authenticity of viral tweets is not far-fetched. The ghost author of the purported tweets states categorically on the bio page that the Twitter account is a “parody.”  The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines “parody” as “a literary or musical work in which the style of an author or work is closely imitated for comic effect or ridicule.” A further check on the account in question — “@General_Ibbro” — showed it is not short of a satirical personification of the former military president. The trajectory of the tweets on the account revealed that the author is a critic of the current administration, hiding under Mr Babangida’s name to express his opinions on public issues. For example, on November 12, 2022, the same parody Twitter operator claimed Mr  Babangida said: “All the current Presidential Aspirants and candidates have my blessings. I am not supporting anyone, but I will obidently wish all of them the very best in the forthcoming elections.”  But a psycho-linguistic analysis of the said tweet by this researcher — based on the semantic analysis of the choice of wording and contextual tracking of the phrases and sentences — revealed that the author was indirectly selling Mr Obi to the audience without necessarily mentioning his name. The use of obidiently, (please note the spelling of the word as it is different from ‘obediently’, an English lexicon), a cognomen emanating from obidient, a derivative noun referring to Mr Obi’s political movement, suggests where the interest of the author belongs. However, on January 7, the media office of Mr Babangida urged Nigerians to disregard any social media account opened in his name. An aide to the former military officer, Salman Yusuf, said in Minna, Niger State, that his principal does not comment on national issues on social media.  “We wish to state that IBB has never owned nor operated any social media account, and he does not intend to operate any now or in the near future,” a statement by Mr Yusuf reads, urging social media users to ignore “warped imaginations and antics of cyber criminals who do not mean well for the country.” Nowhere in the media did Mr Babangida make the statements attributed to him via the parody Twitter account. The claim is, therefore, false and misleading. ",FALSE,10/02/2023,https://dubawa.org/viral-tweets-from-parody-account-allege-babangidas-support-for-peter-obi/
"Claim: “When the rice took place in 1980, I was only 13 years old,” said President Weah on Monday, January 30, 2023, during his final state of the nation address for his first term.","On Monday, January 30, 2023, many Liberians had the opportunity again to listen to their President delivering the nation’s state before members of parliament. President George Weah’s address on Capitol Hill marks his final ‘State of the nation address’ (SONA) of his first term in office. Weah was constitutionally inaugurated into office on January 22, 2018, to provide leadership for the country for six years. The President’s SONA, which gives an idea of the actual state of the nation, also focuses on his Legislative programs for the preceding year. It also considers the expenditure and income of the economy, which fulfils the 1986 constitution of the Republic. During his address to citizens and foreign residents, the President claimed that the famous ‘Rice riot’ occurred in 1980. He said, “I was only 13 years old.” His statement reminded the youth across the country about the ugly past of Liberia’s history, especially in political times, urging them not to allow themselves to be contaminated by everyday politics. Given the historical ties this rice riot signals to the nation and its people, DUBAWA considers it vital to explore the subject further and verify the year it happened. Endowed with many natural resources like gold, diamond, and iron ore, Liberia is also rich in fertile soil. Most Liberian households eat rice for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Interestingly, however, the vast majority of the rice eaten by citizens is not produced in Liberia. The rice riot is one of the largest riots Liberia has ever experienced. The riot led to a dozen deaths and many more injuries following the rice price increment by the then President, William R. Tolbert. Interestingly, Mr Weah maintained that the famous ‘Rice Riot’ took place in 1980, as contained in his speech posted on the Executive Mansion’s official Facebook page name and styled as ‘SONA’ part 3. “When the rice took place in 1980, I was only 13 years old,” said President Weah on Monday, January 30, 2023, during his final state of the nation address for his first term. Contrary to the claim by President Weah that the rice riot took place in 1980 when he was just 13 years, online research indicates the riot took place a year earlier.  Attempts by DUBAWA to discover the information or the actual date of the incident in Parliament proved futile. However, after further search, DUBAWA accessed a New York Times publication detailing the tall order associated with the event and how costly it was for the nation and its people. The report was written a month after the rice riot and was dated May 30, 1979. Other online searches, including the Liberia News Agency, led DUBAWA to multiple publications that credited the rice riot in 1979, as seen here. However, in 1980, a year after the rice riot, there was the Liberia coup, which led to the overthrow and murder of President William Tolbert. Presidential proclamations in the context of SONA are considered historical data, which must be accurate. Mr Weah’s claims that Liberia’s rice riot occurred in 1980 are inaccurate, given the evidence above.   ",FALSE,10/02/2023,https://dubawa.org/it-is-false-to-suggest-rice-riot-took-place-in-1980/
"Claim: Modou Mbowe, the primary suspect of phone theft in N’Yofelleh village, is a police officer.","The identity of a phone thief suspect arrested in the village of N’Yofelleh in The Gambia has become a controversial subject. Modou Mbowe is in custody due to phone theft, but people are sceptical about his identity as an officer of the law. He was arrested with what looked like a police ID card in his possession with his picture embossed on it. After his arrest, What’s On – Gambia published a news item with the headline: “Police officer caught stealing mobile phone.” The report features a video where the suspect could be heard saying, “I am not a regimented officer. I took the phone to my car and later returned it.” The news had attracted about 1.2k engagements, 435 comments, and 22 shares at the time of conducting this fact-check. While some people expressed shock over the report, others claimed the suspect was an imposter.  A Facebook user Paa Amady Jallow wrote, “This suspect is personating as a police officer, which is a serious crime.”   Given the controversy over the suspect’s identity, DUBAWA decided to investigate it. DUBAWA contacted the police for clarification. Cadet ASP Muhammed Darboe, the Deputy Police Spokesperson, confirmed that the accused is a member of The Gambia Police Force.    “This is our man. He is part of The Gambia Police Force. He is one of the ten recently approved as an officer. He works at the police garage as a driver. “He is now detained at Sifoe Police Station and is helping the police in the investigation. He was assessed and found to be worthy as a police driver; that is why the entire allegation involving his name was a huge shock to the police,” Darboe said.  The Police Deputy PRO explained that the suspect is not above the law because he is an officer and that they are taking the investigations very seriously to ensure justice is served.  “After the investigations, the matter will be taken to court, and if he is found guilty, the court will decide his jail term. The police will not keep someone who is not abiding by the code of ethics,” he assured.  According to DUBAWA’s investigation, Modou Mbowe, the primary suspect in the phone theft, is a police driver and is currently detained at Sifoe Police Station. ”",TRUE,10/02/2023,https://dubawa.org/police-officer-not-imposter-caught-stealing-phone-in-nyofelleh-village/
Claim: A WhatsApp message containing a link to a website purporting to be the British multinational oil and gas company Shell claims that the company offers jobs for skilled and unskilled labourers.,"A WhatsApp message containing a link to a website purporting to be the British multinational oil and gas company Shell states that the company offers jobs for skilled and unskilled labourers. Once you open the link in the WhatsApp message, it takes you to a website, and the front page shows an image of individuals wearing the reflected work suit and the company logo.  The site also contains an application form with questions such as “Select Title, Your First Name, Last Name, Phone Number, Email address, and Country.” It is important to note that however applicants answer these questions, they will be directed to another step which automatically “congratulates” and qualifies the applicant to work with the company. When the steps are completed, applicants are again asked to share the link with “five people or 15 friends on WhatsApp.” After the green verification bar is filled, he or she will also be redirected automatically to the company’s appointment page. Applicants are also told that after these processes, they will receive a confirmation email within 24 hours after a successful application. ScamAdviser.com, a verification tool used to certify the originality of websites and links, was used to analyse the authenticity of links. Upon analysis, findings show that the alleged Shell website was suspicious and was rated with a “very bad trust” tag and flagged up as a link associated with scammers. Further research established that the website of the British multinational company Shell Group of Companies does not carry anything like “TABNAIJA” in its URL. The Company does have jobs for skilled and unskilled labourers on their website, but the requirements for these jobs are not to fill out an application form and are in contrast to what was specified on the false link. The real company is also aware of these scam alerts. It has issued a caution on its website about people or sites claiming to be offering jobs at their company.  “Please note that Shell Group of companies (nor any of the organisations that recruit on our behalf) never ask for any money or payments from applicants at any point in the recruitment process. All individuals who successfully gain an offer of employment from a Shell Group company, whether directly or indirectly, are always required to undergo a formal recruitment process. All communications should originate from a verifiable Shell e-mail address and not from an Internet e-mail address, e.g., Hotmail, yahoo etc.”    According to the Shell Group company’s official site, the fraud scam section states:  “The job offers come from organisations falsely pretending to recruit on behalf of Shell Group companies or by people claiming to work for or be affiliated to a Shell Group company. These propositions notify individuals that their qualifications were found suitable to work as an employee (local or expatriate) for a Shell Group company and solicit the transfer of significant sums of money to pay for work permits, insurance policies, etc.” Meanwhile, the company asks those wanting to seek jobs from them to take into consideration that they do not request money from applicants at any point in the recruitment process. Internet users are cautioned against opening these viral links. Based on research, our finding reveals the link in the WhatsApp message has a URL that contains words such as “tabnaija” which cannot be found anywhere in the original link of Shell Group.  It has the potential to compromise people’s private information, meaning some webpages, like that of the purported Shell Oil and Gas recruitment site, is a risk to personal devices and may interfere with the privacy of individuals who access them at any given point. At times, it may encrypt viruses in their devices, scam them or infuse malware or virus in devices.  ",FALSE,10/02/2023,https://dubawa.org/viral-shell-plc-recruitment-on-whatsapp-false/
Claim: Facebook user alleged that Peter Obi announced Aisha Yesufu as his vice presidential candidate.,"Amid the campaign rallies across the country, a Facebook user Willy Ibimina Jim-George shared a short video clip with the caption, “Peter Obi announces Aisha Yesufu as his vice presidential candidate.  Even though the 11 seconds clip was cut short at the mention of the name Aisha, the Facebook user noted it was Aisha Yesufu, an activist who co-founded the #BringBackOurGirls movement and has been vocal about the #Obidient movement that was referenced here.  “Peter Obi announces Aisha Yesufu as a vice presidential candidate,” part of the caption read.  Another user Stanley Chinonye re-shared the same video clip posted by Ayekooto Akindele with the caption, “Did you hear that Peter Obi said that his vice presidential candidate is Aisha?” Recall that in July 2022, Peter Obi named Datti Baba-Ahmed, the founder of Baze University Abuja, as his running mate for the 2023 presidential election. How then will Mr Obi name Aisha Yesufu months after the window for replacing a running mate had closed and with Aisha Yesufu’s clear stand that she can’t be Peter Obi’s running mate? These questions, other suspicions and the timing of this claim prompted us to verify it.  Watching the 11 seconds video, these were the words we could make out: “Several thousand… Borno today. The vice presidential candidate Aisha….” seeing there were a lot of missing contexts, we conducted a keyword search, but that did not lead to any news report on this assertion.  A reverse image search was also not helpful owing to the poor quality of the video. Seeing that Peter Obi also mentioned Borno in the clip, we conducted a keyword search for videos from his rally in Borno state just to find the source of the clip. We found a nine-minute, 46 seconds video clip by Chizzy media on Youtube which didn’t show any mention of Aisha as a vice presidential candidate.  The only mention of Aisha was at the beginning of the video when Mr Obi was talking about security issues and the need for security personnel on the frontline of the battle to be assured their country is behind them.  “… that is why I told Aisha that everyone around will make sure that if a policeman or soldier goes out to fight criminals, he will do so assured that the state is behind him,” Mr Obi said in the video. Another one-minute 15 seconds Youtube video by TVC  only showed a few seconds clip of Peter Obi speaking on nothing related to this claim.  Mr Datti is still listed as Mr Obi’s running mate on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) website.  We also contacted Akin Osuntokun, the Director General of the Labour Party president Campaign Council via calls and direct messages but didn’t get a response.  We subsequently reached out to the party’s spokesperson, Yunusa Tanko, who debunked this.  “Please, this is completely fake news. We have our vice president in Datti Baba-Ahmed,” his response read.  Our findings do not show any video with Peter Obi naming Aisha Yesufu as his running mate, and the party has also denied the claim.

"Claim: Social media, especially Twitter, was awash with claims that popular Nigerian songstress, Tems, was the first Nigerian female artiste to win a Grammy Award.","The 65th Grammy Awards, held on February 5, 2023, has come and gone, but people continue to discuss it online, offline and worldwide. Like other fans of the entertainment industry around the world, Nigerians have also continued to react to the outcome of the award ceremony, especially as it affects Nigerian artistes. Nigerians nominated for the 65th Grammy Award include Temilade Openiyi, popularly known as Tems, Damini Ogulu, popularly known by his stage name Burna Boy and Tobe Nwigwe. While others lost all the categories in which they were nominated, Tems won one of the three categories in which she was nominated. Tems won her nomination in the Best Melodic Rap Performance category for her role in ‘WAIT FOR U,’ where she featured alongside Canadian rapper Drake and American rapper, Future. Following this win, Nigerians have taken to social media to celebrate and congratulate Tems, describing her as the first Nigerian female artiste to achieve the feat. Such tweets came from one Solé, who has about 66,300 followers on Twitter, Pulse News Nigeria, which has about 1.1 million followers and Nigeria Stories, which has about 160,700 followers among other users. A similar claim was also tweeted by the Nigerian ruling All Progressive Congress via their verified Twitter handle. The tweet reads in part:  “Congratulations, Tems @temsbaby (Temilade Openiyi), on Grammy award – a 1st for a female Nigerian artiste.” The news has also been featured in the conventional media, including Punch Newspaper and Okayafrica. The claim has continued to be echoed online and offline, but how true is it? Contrary to the heralding narratives, DUBAWA finds Tems is not the first female artist to have won a grammy in Nigeria. Two female artistes of Nigerian descent have previously won the Grammy.  Findings revealed that Sade Adu, a British-Nigerian artiste born to a Nigerian father and British mother in Ibadan in 1959, was the first Nigerian to win the coveted music prize during the 28th Grammy Award in 1986, where she won in the Best New Artist category. According to Ms Adu’s page on the Grammy website, she had been nominated for the award seven more times since her first nomination – She was nominated for the 29th, 36th, 37th, 44th, 53rd, and 55th editions of the award. She won 4 of her eight nominations – after her luck at the 28th edition of the Grammy award, she also bagged the award during the 36th and 44th editions. She had two nominations during the 53rd edition and won one of the two. DUBAWA also finds that Cynthia Erivo, a British Nigerian, born to Nigerian parents in England in 1987, has also had two Grammy nominations during the 59th and 63rd editions of the award. While she won the Best Musical Theater Album award for her role in ‘The Colour Purple’ during the 59th edition of the Award in 2017, she lost her second shot at the award during the 63rd edition in 2021. Although both Sade Adu and Cynthia Erivo do not live or work in Nigeria, they have previously admitted their Nigerian descent and citizenship.  According to Section 25 of the Nigerian constitution, every person born in Nigeria or outside Nigeria to Nigerian parent(s) is a Nigerian citizen by birth. Article 15 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, to which Nigeria is a signatory, also states that everyone has the right to a nationality, and no one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his nationality. Yemi Alade, another female Nigerian artiste, also featured in the Grammy award-winning album of Angelique Kidjo – Mother Nature. The album won in the Best Global Music Album category at the 64th edition of the Grammy Awards in 2022. Yemi Alade is featured in a track titled ‘Dignity’ in the album. Following checks by DUBAWA, it has been established that Ms Tems is not the first female Nigerian artiste to win the Grammy award. Sade Adu, and Cynthia Erivo have previously won the coveted music prize. EDITOR’s NOTE: This copy has been edited to reflect that Yemi Alade did not win a Grammy, as previously stated.

Claim: A user on Twitter shared a picture of Nollywood actor Osita Iheme dressed in the colours of the Biafran flag to show support for the secessionist group.,"Twitter user, Chris Ososa Asuelime (@OsosaChris), alleges famous Nollywood actor Osita Iheme also known as “Paw-Paw,” has shown his support for the separatist group, the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB). Biafra is a state conceived by secessionists in Southeast Nigeria after some Igbo military leaders unilaterally declared their independence from Nigeria in May 1967. It constituted a part of the former Eastern region of Nigeria and was inhabited principally by Igbo people.  Biafra ceased to exist as an independent state in January 1970. However, the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) was founded in 2012 by Nnamdi Kanu, a believer in the course of secession, to restore the independent State of Biafra. Recently, a tweet, accompanied by a photograph of Mr Iheme adorned in the colours of the Biafran flag, purported that the celebrity actor, who is also from the region, is in support of the secessionist movement, adding that Mr Iheme still supports IPOB movement even after they had allegedly killed his brother.  “Osita Iheme, a.k.a PawPaw showed off his support for Biafra, but in the execution of the five days Sit-at-Home that started in the South East today, IPOB shot dead his elder brother! I didn’t say ANYTHING!” the post read.  The tweet generated over 291 retweets, 687 likes and over 112 quotes within hours of its appearance. While other users argued that the alleged picture is photoshopped, others felt otherwise. @WarriWierdo commented that the image is photoshopped and was shared with the flair of hatred.  “U don go photoshop picture come post and some mumu dey believe u. This just shows how much your hatred is screaming. If dem sue u now u go say who famous dey oppress u or IPOB don pay am [sic].”  DUBAWA also finds that the picture was featured in a blog post on Abiodun BorisadeTV with more details that highlight Mr Iheme’s passion and support for the movement of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB).  Similar allegations in the past have triggered some controversies and aroused diverse debates related to unhealthy political views targeted at tribalism and ethnocentrism.   A Google reverse image of the image showed that the attributed photo of Mr Iheme was doctored and initially lifted from his Instagram handle @ositaIheme.  The environment, shoes, eyeglasses, cap and even Mr Iheme’s pose are the same as the one in the original version of the image that he shared in July 2022.   On December 10, 2022, PremiumTimes reported that gunmen invaded Orji, a community in Mbaitoli Local Government Area of Imo State, South-east Nigeria, where Prince Iheme, an elder brother to Nollywood actor Osita Iheme, was killed during a separate attack in Ubomiri, another community in the council area of the state. Although the media widely reported the event, no mention of IPOB was made. The reports, however, termed the perpetrators as “gunmen”. To date, IPOB is yet to take responsibility for the attack.  Although the actor has been linked to secessionist groups, DUBAWA could not trace records of the actor showing support for the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), as claimed by the Twitter user.  The alleged photo of Mr Iheme adorned in a Biafran flag is photoshopped to suit the narrative. While Mr Iheme’s brother was killed in December last year, no report links it to IPOB.

"Claim: The doctor-to-patient ratio under George Weah is one to 20,000, according to Activist Martin Kollie.","Activist Martin Kollie, in one of his regular Facebook posts dated January 3, 2023, quoted the WHO that the Doctor-to-Patient Ratio should be 1 to 1,000. He added that under George Manneh Weah, the narrative is worrying. According to him, at the moment in Liberia, “there is one doctor for 20,000 patients,” citing the WHO 2021/2022 HWF report as his source. He said, “It was 1 to 15,000 under Ellen Johnson Sirleaf. Y’all go and put Jorweah there again. It will go up to 1 to 50,000. Crisis!!” Activist Martin Kollie, who posted the statement on January 4, 2022, on his official Facebook page, has sparked public debate among Facebook users. Some Facebook users agreed with Kollie over his claim, while others branded the post as political and false. Liberia’s fragile health sector has been exposed on two different occasions, both in 2014 and 2019. The former was due to the deadly Ebola virus outbreak leading to the deaths of scores of citizens. The country reported the highest number of Ebola cases in the West African region. Though Liberia has been declared free of Ebola, its adverse effects remain fresh in the minds of ordinary people.   Hit by the global Covid-19 in 2020, the nation, as of January 11 (2023), recorded a total number of 294 deaths and total confirmed cases at 8,043. Like other nations of the world, COVID also affected the cost of living for ordinary Liberians.  With the challenges associated with the health implications mentioned above, we decided to verify the claim by activist Martin Kollie on his official Facebook page. The doctor-to-patient ratio refers to the number of available doctors per every 10,000 inhabitants in a population, in a given year, for a given country, territory, or geographic area. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a one to 1,000 doctor-to-patient ratios for adequate healthcare service. With this recommendation from the WHO, it is critical to examine the truth behind the claim.  Activist Kollie, in his statement, specifically referenced the 2021/2022 Health Workforce (HWF report) as his source. But, online research for the 2021/2022 HWF report seems inaccessible. This researcher reached out to the WHO local office to access the report, but it was not provided despite many efforts. However, the WHO, according to an official working with the Ministry of Health, Chester Smith, the global health institution, does not release such national data to individuals. The World Health Organization measurement method concerning data collection is often drawn from its country offices based on information reported by the national health authority.  However, the national health authority in Liberia, charged with feeding the WHO with national data, rubbished the claim. The Deputy Minister for Planning and Research at the Ministry of Health, A. Vaifee Tulay, said that on record, there are 920 medical doctors currently in Liberia, contrary to the claim from Kollie. “Statistically, when one measures the above number of Medical doctors against the nation’s estimated 4.8 million population, you will have the figure of about 5,000 patients to 1 Doctor,” A. Vaifee Tulay noted. When asked about the WHO 2021/2022 HWF report, Deputy Minister Tulay maintained that such a report has not reached his desk, “Not to my knowledge, maybe it is on its way.” Interestingly, when contacted, Kollie, who claimed to have gathered his information from the World Health Organization HWF, backpedalled on his previous source. As indicated below, the claimant referred DUBAWA to the Liberia Medical and Dental Council report. Our examination revealed that the latest data released by the Liberia Medical and Dental Council on the number of doctors in the country says otherwise. “The total number of Liberian doctors is 917; of the 917, 407 had been active from 2020/2022 while others had passed, others retired from practising, and others were not coming to renew their license. So we have 510 that fall in this category,” said the Liberia Medical Dental Council report. On the number of foreign doctors practising and visiting Liberia, the report states that there are 1,170 foreign doctors registered with the Medical Council. Of the 1,170, only 517 had been active since 2020. “Most of the rest have returned without knowledge of the council while others also passed,” said the Liberia Medical and Dental Council. But in 2016, the Medical and Dental Council, under President Sirleaf’s administration, released a report that came close to the claimant’s position on the doctor-to-patient ratio in Liberia. We cannot guarantee whether this report, released eight years ago, was reliable because the author failed to cite the particular year. Online research brought DUBAWA closer to this 2016 Liberia Medical and Dental report referenced by ‘Yale.’ The Liberia Medical Dental Council, among other things, noted that the total number of Medical doctors who are currently with the Council from 2020/2022 is 924, a figure that slightly contradicts the Deputy Minister of Health, who put the total number of doctors in Liberia at 920. Given the nature of such a claim and the lack of evidence to back it, the claim is deemed false. In view of the fact that there are between 920 and 947 medical doctors to 4.8 million citizens, a ratio of one doctor to 5,000 patients, the claim by Maerin Kollie that the doctor-patient ratio in Liberia is one to 20,000 is false.

Claim: A page on Facebook posted a video alleging a shootout between men of the Nigeria Police Force and a gang group.,"As Nigeria prepares for the general elections in the backdrop of worsening insecurity,  citizens continue to be on the lookout for flashpoints and incidents to avoid.  So when a page on Facebook, Dreson Albert Entertainment Blog,  posted a video of an alleged shootout between the police and some men in black clothing, with the caption “happening life,” followed by a crying emoji, giving the impression that the incident is real, it gathered huge reaction, turning out to be the most watched video yet on the page. As of Sunday, January 29, 2023, the video has garnered 1.5 million views, 4.3k likes, 850 shares and 1.3k comments.  In the less than one minute video, four policemen and a man dressed in a grey suit seems to be after some criminals dressed in black and riding in a yellow mini-bus.  While the uniformed officers take cover while exchanging fire with the men in the yellow bus, the man in a grey suit moves towards them and seems to be hit by a bullet. The video generated different reactions from several responders.  Comrade-Oghene Emmanuel said, “Sometimes I just feel for the Nigeria Police. See them in a crossfire front line without any bulletproof vest. May God protect them and help them crack down on all criminal gangs.”  Another commentator, Basil Ovu, believing the video to be true, blamed the policeman who seemed to have been shot in the video for being careless.  “How can the guy in a suit expose himself so blatantly? The policemen in the van were more circumspect, not to mention that he was holding an ordinary pistol that was practically useless judging by the distance between him and the targets. May we never use our hands to kill ourselves.” But Tolu King was sceptical about the authenticity of the video. “This is fake considering the environment; you could see people still sitting down as if nothing is happening. If it were to be real at the sound of a gunshot, the whole place must scatter,” he said.  The heightened gun violence in the country has led many citizens to be security conscious, which is why the video generated so many reactions and why we are choosing to fake-check it.  To verify the video, DUBAWA ran it through InVID, a video verification tool which helps verify videos by breaking them into keyframes. Invid provided three critical frames from the video on Facebook, and a reverse image search showed no similar images. DUBAWA went back to the post on Facebook in search of clues about where the video was from. In a search through the video comment, some mentioned that the environment looks like a scene in the movie “Brotherhood” they had seen.  A keyword search of “movie brotherhood,” led to several results, including the movie’s trailer on YouTube, with the yellow bus on the Facebook video appearing on it.  Brotherhood is an action movie about two brothers who took different paths after the death of their father- one becoming a police officer and the other an armed robber.  With a talented cast consisting of Falz, Tobi Bakre, Basket Mouth, Macaroni and others, the movie was released in 2022. DUBAWA carried out a scene-by-scene analysis of the movie Brotherhood on Video-on-demand provider Amazon Prime and discovered that the video on Facebook is a recording of the filming of a scene in the movie where the cops (the four policemen and the man in grey suit) were chasing after a gang of robbers (the men in the yellow mini-bus) who had just robbed a bank. The scene is about 45 minutes into the movie.  The video is from the set of the movie, “Brotherhood,” and not from real life, as the post on Facebook suggests.

"Claim: Ouroboros’ occult vector is an occult sign, and Tinubu’s cap suggests he is a member.","Amidst the series of campaigns staged in the country by different political office hopefuls for the February elections, a Twitter user and popular pro-Peter Obi social media influencer, has made a tweet insinuating that the All Progressives Congress (APC’s) presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, belongs to a cult group. He backed this with the claim that the infinity-like embroidery knitted on his cap bears semblance to the Ouroboros occult vector.  The Twitter user NEFERTITI (@firstladyship), who made the tweet on Monday, January 30, 2023, urged both supporters of the Obi-Datti presidential bid and other Twitter users to “spread” the photo grid of the Ouroboros occult vector symbol and Mr Tinubu on WhatsApp.  The photo grid shared in this post has the infinity-coiled serpent symbol of the Ouroboros occult vector on one half and the picture of the APC presidential candidate adorned in a Yoruba cap, having an infinity-like embroidery on its sides on the other half.  The assertion, “This is an occultic sign, is written above the serpent-coiled ensign. Members are brutal. They love money, and they can kill for power.” However, much of that assertion remains debatable and subject to scrutiny for merits. Furthermore, the Peter Obi endeared social media influencer seemed to stray off her initial stance but never relieving the former two-time Lagos governor of her critique. She included in the thread a cartooned image of a sad-faced boy whose hands are shackled in Tinubu’s cap emblem. The tweet, which has now generated over 661,000 views, 4,448 retweets, 312 quoted tweets, and 7,674 likes, unsurprisingly drew divergent opinions from other users of the micro-blogging platform.  NEFERTITI is not the only Twitter user who believes Mr Tinubu is associated with a cult group because of the semblance his cap embroidery shares with the symbol. Another Twitter user, Street Certified Vegan(@okpoOgban), in the comment section also shared a post declaring that the APC’s presidential candidate was definitely into an occult group because the embroidered signature on his cap is used by one.  The post, which has the picture of a snake positioned upright, and swallowing its tail, bears a message below it, asserting that an “occult group” uses the “Jagaban” (Tinubu) symbol. While it states that people “are wearing what they don’t understand,” it urges “Nigerians” to “fight for your life and destiny.” A Twitter user, Sosodef (@aisosaigiebor), queried the post, countering, “do you have to result (resort) to insults(ing) people?” Another Twitter user, beedeepro (@Dailymercytye), mocked it, commenting, “They there dey post rubbish, don’t go and find something meaningful to do as a woman lol.” Amid these comments, a few Twitter users were quick to swallow the contents of the post, hook, line, and sinker, and within a twinkle of an eye, dispatched the tweet even across other social media platforms.  Lovechijioke (General Show) (@Realsnowlove1) commented in his native language, “Ya kpotuba,” meaning “It is happening,” shared a screenshot of his WhatsApp interface with his mother, detailing that he had done as the post has asked.  Instantly seeing the post as a bargaining chip to dissuade the voting populace from favouring the APC with their votes, a Twitter user Better_days (@Emmytaj), scratched the idea to make use of the post to convince the late-bloomer generation to vote for the APC at the polling booths.  He commented, “This is the only way to convince Nigerian parents not to vote for APC; show them this, and they’ll even start praying against APC.” Shifting the perspective away from the politically-inciting post’s argument, a commenter in the comment section tried to explain away the perceived logic in the tweet. The commenter, Johnson Marvis (@marvis_hottyme), upheld neutrally that symbols are of exquisite representation to people, and they hold onto them dearly because of the personal meanings they attach to them. “Symbols are very powerful, and for him (Tinubu) to carry that symbol everywhere he goes, it means the symbol is important either to him or a group of people if there are other people who wear it every time too,” he wrote. Knowing the superstitious nature of Nigerians and how this can be played on during strategic events like the election, DUBAWA decided to investigate the claim carefully.  Verifying this claim is also vital, seeing the reputation of the APC presidential candidate and his party is at stake. In a 2017 British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) publication, it was disclosed that the Ouroboros symbol had been a “subject of awe and wonder” throughout “millennia.”   The Greek term means “tail-devourer” in its literal sense and is perceived differently in different forms and contexts. But the general and oldest traditional interpretation of the symbol denotes a snake eating its tail in a circle-enclosed manner.  It may bear a Greek interpretation, but it isn’t entirely Greek or of Greek origin, and neither does it suggest self-cannibalism. According to the BBC publication, the earliest manifestation of the Ouroboros is in a “golden shrine in the tomb of Tutankhamun – ‘King Tut’ – in Egypt in the 13th Century BC.” This occurred when traditional religion was almost unheard of and out of practice. This was during Akhenaten’s (Tutankhamun’s predecessor) reign.  Egyptologist Jan Assmann said the symbol depicts “the mystery of cyclical time, which flows back into itself.” The Egyptians explained time as a “series of repetitive cycles” rather than “linear”. The ideology suggests the “flooding of the Nile” and the “journey of the sun”.  Mr Assmann suggests that the Egyptians believed that the flooding of the Nile in summer symbolised the beginning of the year and served as a “metaphor of cyclical time,” which enabled “renewal, repetition, and regeneration.” In a similar vein as well, the sun was also conceived to follow a cyclical systemic pattern, “undertaking a nightly journey to the waters of Nun (a sort of primordial void), fraught with all sorts of obstacles, whence it would find its way back to the sky.” Therefore, in the Egyptian context, the symbol means a revolving repetition of the time pattern. The Egyptians were not the only authority of the ouroboros ideology, as the Greek alchemists of Hellenistic Alexandria also held the belief. In Cleopatra’s chrysopoeia – the transmutation of gold – the ouroboros appears to be a pictorial alchemical papyrus from the 3rd Century AD. It represented the creation of gold, which appears among the mysterious symbols and images encircling the Greek words ‘One is All.’ Greek alchemists regard the Ouroboros as the “oldest allegorical symbol in alchemy.” It symbolises the “concept of eternity” and “endless return.” It also depicts the “unity of time’s beginning and end.” Notably, on the papyrus is a double ring, which connotes the mantra “One is All is only a part: One is All, and by it All, and for it All. And if it does not contain All, then All is Nothing.” The Ouroboros also dominated the Gnostics’ belief. According to the Gnostics, the symbol represented the “divine and earthly in man,” which, despite their contradiction, interacted together. In Norse mythology, the ouroboros is explained as the “serpent Jormungandr” which “encircles the world with its tail in its mouth.” In Hinduism, the ouroboros “forms part of the foundation upon which the Earth rests.” It (ouroboros) took a different transition among the Roman variant of Iranian Mithraism, Zurvan, as it symbolises “boundless time” that showcases “ouroboros entwined around his body.” While the Mesoamerican deity Quetzalcoatl is “often seen in the form of an ouroboros.” The Ouroboros myth also prospered among Renaissance alchemists. Again, the symbol was perceived as “representing the infinite nature of time and eternal.” It was seen by the alchemists “as the ultimate obstacle to be overcome in the Magnum Opus,” which was the struggle to become immortal. They desired to break the “incessant cycle of the ouroboros once and for all.” So, by all definitions and beliefs, the ouroboros is itself used to suggest the passage of life in a cyclical pattern. It only resonates with the words in Nietzsche’s Thus Spoke Zarathustra, declaring, “Behold, we know what you teach,” said the author of his protagonist – an antithesis of the historical prophet, “that all things occur eternally and we, along with them, and that we have already been here times eternal and all things with us.” The Ouroboros may be traced to the ancient Moon cults. The moon was regarded as a timekeeper. It was viewed as being in control of time’s eternal, cyclical nature. Furthermore, it was seen as a source of life on earth. It became a representation of birth, death, and regeneration because of its nature to live, outlive and be reborn.  Lunar bodies were known to associate with devouring snakes or dragons, which became the mother of the moon’s rebirth after swallowing the moon.  In ancient times, the Egyptians regarded the goddess Buto as a cobra. Buto was known to safeguard ISIS and Horus, her son. Similarly, every person is protected by a personal snake spirit that showcases their lifetime and survival into the afterlife.  The earliest form of the Ouroboros in Egypt comes from the tomb of Seti, where a carving depicts the sun god lying on his back in a house surrounded by an ouroboros. The art was crafted to represent the immortality of the dead. Tutankhamun’s third shrine reveals the dead in a stylised profile with one ouroboros encircled around his head and feet. In a 2019 interview with the Guardian newspaper, the former two-time Lagos State governor and APC presidential candidate explained the intention behind the prominent embroidery on his cap. He explained that the embroidery symbolises an unshackled dispensation from bondage. “Philosophically, it is my belief and faith in education, freedom fighting. On my cap is a broken shackle. It is freedom. The shackle is broken, and you can no longer put us in bondage. You have broken the shackle of poverty, ignorance and disease. The APC stalwart had said. The Ouroboros symbolically suggests eternal life and has no relationship with members who are brutal, love money, or kill for power. The claim is false as Tinubu’s cap does not have anything to do with the symbol or anything that even suggests that he is a member.

Claim: A viral WhatsApp message claims that the Australian government has announced visa sponsorship and jobs in Australia for 2023.,"A viral WhatsApp message claims that the government of Australia is offering visa sponsorship and jobs in 2023. The message, as expected from many parts of the global south, was mandated to be shared with five groups or 15 friends on WhatsApp, after which applicants will be redirected automatically to the visa form, which the website stated would be followed by a confirmation code within 24 hours. DUBAWA completed the sharing process to access the visa form and verify its truthfulness. After the share column reaches 100%, a print form automatically pops up, sharing the same link with the share options. Clicking on the print form showed up without a specific link. However, it brought Premier Bet Register and later a page accepting applications to offer temporary permits for caregivers in Canada, not the visa form as previously stated. The content in the WhatsApp message further reads as follows: “The government is also looking for Nationals and International applicants who can fill the Shortage of jobs in Australia. Australian Public services are giving out thousands of jobs.”  The message, however, ends with a link that, when clicked, takes applicants to an application form asking for personal information.  The website was analysed on Scamdoc, which showed a “1% very bad trust index.” The domain is seen to have been created in Canada, while the creation date is seen to have been in 2022, while the expiration date is in 2024. However, though ScamDoc site publishers do not influence the rating of a specific domain or URL, the URL in the WhatsApp message directs users to a page where they are asked to provide personal details like names, email, and country of origin, among others. A check of the website shows that the Uniform Resource Locator (URL), which shows the address of a given resource on the world wide web, does not have the .gov.au domain which is used by the official website of the Australian Government Department of Employment and Workplace Relations dewr.gov.au. The Australian Government Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade’s official website, dfat.gov.au, also carries the .gov.au that the typical Australian government website – unlike the website of the viral WhatsApp message- carries. Further checks on the immigration and home affairs section of the Australian government website spell out the conditions under which a visa and jobs can be offered, and those procedures are completely different from the ones being shared in the viral message.   DUBAWA also discovered that the site has an additional ‘Secure Sockets Layer’ (SSL certificate) which enables it to carry https to convince users that it is credible. But according to WebTitan, HTTPS or an SSL certificate alone is not a guarantee that the website is secure and can be trusted. Additional checks show that “ly” is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for the Libyan government and not the Australian government. According to Marcaria.com Network, Domain Registration in Australia, to register a website in Australia, one will have to “enter the .COM.AU” and/or “.NET.AU” domain name(s) assigned to the country and not bit.ly. Checks on the Australia Immigration website, including a website verification process of the viral message, show that the claims made in the viral message are false.

Claim: WASH Commission head says Weah’s administration reduced Open Defecation from 42% in 2018 to 38%.,"The Water and Sanitation Hygiene Commission styled as the “WASH Commission”, is a state-owned institution. The commission is tasked as the principal government agency to regulate and promote Sanitation and Hygiene Services in Liberia. Open defecation (OD) refers to the percentage of the population defecating in the open, such as in fields, forests, bushes, open bodies of water, on beaches and other open spaces. In Liberia, poor sanitation, notably Open Defecation, is among issues that are not given much coverage, although it remains a critical issue in the country. It is also an explicit focus of SDG 6.2. Given the issue of Open Defecation, it is important to hear President Weah talk to the nation about the subject and the efforts government is making to improve sanitation. The President’s assurances will be hinged on information provided by the only Water and Sanitation & Hygiene Commission in Liberia headed by Mr Bobby Whitefield. Recently, Whitefield told the state broadcaster, ELBC, that President George Weah will have so much to mention about the commission when he delivers his annual message to the nation on January 30. In an interview with State Radio, Whitefield stated that “the President will be able to indicate to Liberians in his annual message that under his leadership, the country has cut down the open defecation rate from 42% to 38%.” He added: “Under the leadership of President Weah, the country has cut down the open defecation rate from 42% to 38%.” The Weah-led administration took office in 2018 and is currently still in power; Whitefield’s statement suggests that the reduction occurred between 2018 and 2023. He maintained that the latest statistic is huge progress, adding, “it is expected to add colours to the Liberian leader’s State of the Nation address.” The WASH Boss made the statement on Thursday, January 12, 2023, on the Super Morning Show, a live radio program on the Liberia Broadcasting System. He can be heard during the 37 mins of the program, which lasted for 54:04 sec. The particular statement followed a question, “if the President was to mention WASH Commission in his annual message, what would be the compelling storyline?” asked the host. DUBAWA reached out to Bobby Whitefield on WhatsApp to clarify his statement about the reduction in open defecation.  He referred to the latest  Joint Monitoring Program (JMP) Report as his source. “This is the latest Joint Monitoring Program report (JMP) report conducted by WHO and UNICEF and measures access to water, sanitation and hygiene.” Given the urgent need for better sanitation and a further reduction of open defecation in Liberia, DUBAWA decided to explore the matter and assess the data available from statutory institutions and international organizations. Using the document given us by Whitfield, we were able to extract information that partly confirms his statement. The latest WHO/UNICEF 2020 Joint Monitoring Program Report was published in 2020 and updated in 2021. Image: Screenshot of data summary (OD highlighted in the blue box). According to the report, Open defecation (OD) reached 37.7%, approximately 38%, as stated by Whitefield. However, the same report suggests that in 2018 OD was 38.8, not 42 as he claimed. We consulted other credible sources to compare the data available on OD in Liberia.  According to data from the World Bank, open defecation was at 39% in 2018 and has fallen steadily up to 2020. The Bank’s data for people practising open defecation in Liberia covers the year 2000 to 2020. Also, Wateraid Liberia, on Jan 23, 2023, posted on its  official Twitter page that “38% of the people in Liberia practice open defecation, and this results in sanitation-related diseases.” Apart from these Facebook and Twitter posts from Wateraid, there is no latest report or data beyond 2020 on Liberia for open defecation that can be accessed to authenticate Whitefield’s assertion. President George Weah ascended to the Liberian Presidency on January 22, 2018, following an overwhelming victory in the 2017 Presidential and Legislative Elections in Liberia, which marks the first major transition in post-war Liberia.  Open defecation in Liberia, as of 2018, was at 38.8%, with a total population of 1,868,885.  By 2020, the Liberian population had increased to 1,905,886, and the OD rate had gone down to 37.7%, according to the JMP report 2020. A scrutiny of the data provided by Bobby Whitfield shows that while it is true OD may have reduced to 37% in 2020 during Mr Weah’s presidency, it was not 42% in 2018, as he stated. Rather it was 38.8%. It is expected that government and its development partners will work hand-in-hand to reduce open defecation if it cannot stop it completely.

"Claim: “When I came into office in 2018, only 16% of Sierra Leoneans had access to electricity,” said President Julius Maada Bio","Electricity is the engine of economic growth and development across the globe. Sierra Leone, like many other countries, has been moving towards increasing access to electricity for more of its citizens.  For post-war Sierra Leone, one of the objectives has been to rebuild the damaged infrastructure and to consolidate the infrastructure projects for the growing population. Electricity is not just a luxury; on the path to achieving the Millennium Development Goals, the UN Millennium Project listed access to electricity as one of the catalysts to achieving all other goals by 2015. Fast forward to the development of the Sustainable Development Goals; Energy has its pillar, Pillar 7, which captures electricity. Meanwhile, in Sierra Leone, access to electricity is a political subject; candidates and presidents have used it to drum up support and sell their ideas for political capital. Governments have been pressured to sustain electricity, sometimes at a very high cost. However, it is worth noting that whether you go by figures from government or international partners, access to electricity is still a major challenge in Sierra Leone, with more than half of the population still in the dark. In the quest to show progress in access to electricity, there have been references to various contradictory figures by current government officials to highlight how many people had access to electricity before they took over the government in 2018. Regarding this point, President Julius Maada Bio said: “When I came into office in 2018, only 16% of Sierra Leoneans had access to electricity. We have taken that number up to 31% and increased peak load electricity consumption in many parts of the country.”  He made the statement last month in his Christmas address to the nation as posted on the website of the President’s Office. While the President made a live delivery of his statement on national television, it has also been reshared on Youtube by SN Radio (9:45-10:06), claiming over 7,000 views as of press time. DUBAWA found the comments by the president to be controversial, especially when other government officials had given different figures in the past. So this fact-checker set out to interrogate the matter and determine whether the data provided by the president is accurate. Two months before the President’s speech, DUBAWA found that the Minister of Energy, Alhaji Kanja Sesay and Minister of Information, Mohamed Rahman Swaray, were quoting and agreeing on a much lower figure, claiming that the current government met access to electricity at 12%. Their statement contradicted the President’s figures, which stated that access was at 16%.  Both ministers made their respective claims during a weekly Facebook live hosted by Mr Swaray on October 13, 2022, known as “Talk to d Minister” (watch from 10:00- 10:35). This Facebook Live has since garnered over 5,700 views, with a growing number of comments and shares.  Government officials, including the Director of Communication, Micheal Berewa, are also doubling down on these claims, making them viral. Mr Berewa posted the claim on his Facebook wall with well-edited graphics giving out the details.  While the president quoted 16%, the state’s data agency – Statistics Sierra Leone, was reporting that the number was approximately 21%. According to Page 162 of the 2018 Sierra Leone Integrated and Housing Survey, “Table 6.137.1 shows approximately 21.0 per cent of households have electricity in their dwellings via a grid system (national), with an average of 15.5 hours a week of electricity.”   This survey was released in October 2019. The President gave his speech in Parliament seven months later, ignoring the latest data from the statistics agency.   The World Bank has a rich repository of data on many economy-related areas, from finance and business to energy. Their data has been perfected over decades of research, with methodological transparency and the availability of raw datasets for an independent analysis.  The government of Sierra Leone has also used World Bank data to develop or analyze policies, lending strong credibility to its work. While President Bio said in his 2022 Christmas address to the nation that his government met access to electricity at 16%, World Bank said in 2017 that access to electricity was at 23.4%. In 2018 which is the year President Bio took over, the figure was 26%, as shown in this graph below: The Energy Progress Report was done by the World Bank in collaboration with the International Energy Agency, International Renewable Energy Agency, The United Nations Statistics Division and the World Health Organization. These claims will be at the centre of campaign messaging in the months leading up to the election; fact-checking them is important to prevent misinformation or minimize its impact.

"Claim: Today’s inflation rate is around 16%, whereas, under the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) administration, it remained in the single digits.","Claim: Today’s inflation rate is around 16%, whereas, under the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) administration, it remained in the single digits.  Verdict: FALSE. Under the PDP’s administration, the nation’s inflation rate fluctuated between single and double digits, and presently it is at 21.34% to the CBN December 2022 report.  Politicians, especially candidates in Nigeria’s coming 2023 general elections, have been wooing voters since the electoral umpire, Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), opened the campaign window in September 2022.  At the national level, especially among the presidential candidates, the campaign has become very intense, with candidates and their teams making numerous claims to prove themselves as the right one.  On January 16, 2023, a member of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential campaign council, Bukola Saraki, was on Arise TV. During the interview, he claimed that today’s inflation rate is around 16%, whereas, under the PDP, it remained in the single digits. The claim was made between 4:18 minutes to 4:25 minutes in the video.  The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, is Nigeria’s main opposition political party presently and used to be the ruling party in power between 1999 and 2015.  The party is also participating as it has always done since 1999 in the coming 2023 presidential election.  Former vice president Atiku Abubakar (1999-2003) is the flag bearer of the party this time, just as in the 2019 general election.  Bukola Saraki was a two-term governor of Kwara State and president of the Nigerian Senate from 2015 to 2019.  The All Progressive Congress, APC, has been the current ruling party since 2015, with Muhammadu Buhari as the president.  Data from the Central bank of Nigeria (CBN) show the inflation rates in Nigeria from 1999 to 2022.  The above table and chart show the inflation rates in Nigeria only stayed at single digits in 1999, 2000, 2006, 2007, 2013, 2014 and 2015. For the other years, it was in double digits. The data also shows that the years when single digits were recorded fall well under the PDP era, except for 2015, which the APC completed. It is also clear from the data that apart from 2015, the first year of the APC, the ruling party did not record a single digit for the years under review.  However, we can not deduce if Saraki was referring to where his party left it when they handed over power in 2015.  The inflation rate in 2014 was 8 per cent and 9.55 per cent in 2015, which simply means that the PDP handed over a single-digit inflation regime to the APC.  Nonetheless, it is obvious that the APC has not been able to keep the rate at a single digit beyond 2015, when it took power from the PDP. But the highest inflation rate of 23.8% in the country’s history in 2003 was under a PDP government. Our finding shows that the inflation rate under the 16-year PDP was not at single digit only, and the current inflation rate (as of January 2023) is not 16 per cent as claimed by Bukola Saraki.  The rate currently stands at 21.34 per cent as of December 2022, in contrast to 23.8% in 2003.   ———————————————————————————————————————– The researcher produced this fact-check per the DUBAWA 2023 Kwame KariKari Fellowship partnership with the newsroom of Wazobia FM and Nigeria Info FM to facilitate the ethos of “truth” in journalism and enhance media literacy in the country.

Claim: ‘Dubai is the most visited place on Earth.’ – Talk Show host.,"A famous radio talk show host in Liberia, Weekie Brooks, claimed that Dubai is the most visited place in the world. Mr Brooks hosts a popular early morning radio show, “The Morning Ride,” aired on Kool 91.9FM and carried live on the station’s Facebook and online TV.   During the show’s Friday, January 20, 2023 edition, Mr Brooks said, “Dubai is the most visited area on planet earth.” Mr Brooks claimed whilst discussing the troubling phenomenon of Liberian passports in the hands of foreign nationals and the culture of corruption by Liberian officials. He alleged Dubai had become the most pleasurable destination for corrupt African leaders. Mr Brooks claimed at 1:4:55-59 seconds of the over two hours show. The show was live on the entity’s Facebook page/online TV and had over 500 viewers, over 20 comments, two shares and over 30 emojis. Dubai has, over the years, established itself as the preferred destination with great tourist attractions. But it is one thing for a country to attract lots of tourist interest, and it’s another to be declared the world’s largest tourist destination. DUBAWA, therefore, decided to explore the data behind the most visited countries and tourism destinations across the globe.  DUBAWA searched to discover more about the famous Arab city and discovered that Dubai is the most populous city of the seven cities within the United Arab Emirates (UAE).  As popular as it may be in the UAE, is Dubai the most visited destination globally? DUBAWA found a news report published by Cable News Network (CNN) in December of 2022 titled “The world’s top city destinations for 2022.” Dubai is ranked second to Paris, France. According to the report, before the outbreak of COVID-19, when the index ranked leading destinations by the number of international arrivals, the list was dominated by Asian destinations, with Hong Kong and Bangkok leading the pack. “But now, for the second year running, Paris has held onto the top spot in the Top 100 City Destinations Index 2022, while eight out of the top 10 cities are its European neighbours.” the CNN report revealed. The CNN report stated, “Dubai once again was number two on the list, but took the top spot regarding actual international arrivals. More than 12 million inbound trips were made to Dubai this year – almost double last year’s performance. This would have been helped in no small part by the delayed Expo 2020 Dubai, which ran from October 2021 to March 2022.” Also, according to a December 7, 2022 report published under the caption top 100 city destinations index by Euromonitor International, Paris is again ranked first over Dubai as the world’s most visited place Under this report, “Paris accelerates to once again claim the title of the world’s top city in 2022, closely followed by Dubai, which retains its second position. The Top 10 rankings see the hegemony of European destinations, with only Dubai and New York challenging the status quo this year.” Based on all of the searches conducted by DUBAWA with evidence from well-known international sites, Cable News Network (CNN) and Euromonitor International, it is safe to conclude that Dubai is not the most visited place in the world, but rather Paris, the Capital of France, is currently the world’s most visited place.

Claim: A viral tweet stated that no Nigerian university had developed a maize seed for commercial purposes.,"In recent times, the agricultural sector has been brought to the front burner in discussions not just around economic diversification but also around increasing the capacity to meet the demands of local farmers. The role of harnessing the potentials inherent in Nigerian research and development institutions remains cogent in driving growth and development in this sector. A handful of Nigerian higher institutions are beginning to look inwards to provide homegrown solutions to challenges. Recently, Twitter user That farmer boy (@farmexecutive) shared a tweet with the assertion that no single university in Nigeria had developed a maize seed for commercial purposes.  This tweet has been viewed over 42,000 times, retweeted by 56 Twitter users and liked by over 50 followers.    The significance of this claim and the engagement it has attracted prompted us to verify this claim and set the records straight.  Our research into the work being done by Nigerian universities revealed that the Institute for Agricultural Research, IAR, Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, secured approval to release three new high-yielding nutrient maize varieties for planting in Nigeria. According to the institute, approval was granted by the National Varietal Release Committee at the National Centre for Genetic Resources and Biotechnology in Ibadan in a Certificate dated October 8, 2021, and comes into effect from October 8, 2021, to October 5, 2024. It also stated that the maize varieties tagged: SAMMAZ 52, SAMMAZ 53 and SAMMAZ 54 were offshoots of extensive “on-station, multi-locational and on-farm’’ evaluations with strong farmer participation and varieties were desirable to many maize farmers, seed companies, and food processing entrepreneurs, agro-allied industries as well as consumers across Nigeria. We also found out that more universities joined the train as researchers in the Faculty of Agriculture, University of Ilorin, Kwara state, in collaboration with the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA), Ibadan, in 2021 developed a new breed of maize, named ILOMAZ-1.  News reports also showed that the federal government of  Nigeria granted environmental approval for these maize seeds or evaluation and open cultivation.  The tweet by the That farm boy is false as our findings show more than one Nigerian university has developed and gained approval for the commercialisation of their maize seeds.

"Claim: Nigerian soldiers burn young men alive in Orsu, Ihiteukwa, in Imo State.","Amid the increasing fear of insecurity in Nigeria, a video of soldiers burning a heap of things and throwing in bodies recently went viral on WhatsApp groups. The 20 seconds video shows the soldiers were also taking video of the act with their mobile phones.  The video, which was first seen on a WhatsApp group on Thursday, January 19, 2023, was captioned, “Today Wednesday, 28th of January, 2023, at Orsu Ihiteukwa in Orsu LGA, Imo State Nigeria; soldiers burning young men alive. Please, let this go as far as you can spread. This is the climax of lawlessness and constitutional abuse of human rights to justice and fair hearing.” The caption, which described the act as the height of extra judicial execution of alleged criminal suspects in Nigeria, urged people to spread the information to bring the perpetrators to justice.  Due to the virality, and the sensitive nature of the video, especially at a time which coincides with the anniversary of the Nigerian civil war and upcoming general elections, DUBAWA considered it a responsibility to verify.  Our first observation was that the video was circulated on different January dates. A version asserted that this occurred on January 28, 2023, a future date far from when the video was shared.  A keyword search of the video on YouTube showed that the video did not originate from Nigeria. We found a two-minute, 57-second video on Al Jazeera’s YouTube channel on January 13, 2023. This video garnered over 44,000 views on the same day.  The video description noted this was a regional force fighting armed groups in Mozambique. We also noticed that the video was recorded in November 2022. Watching the video, we saw that the narrator, identified as Tigere Chagutah, from Amnesty International, said the video shows human rights violations are still occurring in the Mozambique conflict, which started in 2017.  The tag on one of the soldiers in the video identified him as a South African military personnel. Furthermore, the Namibian Broadcasting Corporation also reported on January 12, 2023,  that an investigation into the matter had been launched by the Southern African Development Community (SADC), a body responsible for the troop deployment to Mozambique. An analysis by another news platform on YouTube, News Central, also lays credence to the fact that the video was not that of Nigerian soldiers.  Also, contrary to the assertion that those being burnt were alive, a careful study of the video revealed that they were dead. Our findings show that the incident in the video happened in Mozambique. Hence, the narrative that Nigerian soldiers in the Orsu Local Government Area of Imo State burnt young men alive is false.

Claim: Consumption of meat and dairy products affects climate change.,"Claim: Consumption of meat and dairy products affects climate change. Verdict: True.  According to the United Nations, climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. Recently, discussions around climate change and its effect on the planet have continued to increase. Humans worldwide have experienced climate variability – from extreme weather events to floods, water scarcity, and storms.  However, there has been a significant increase in the last hundred years due to the burning of fossil fuels.  Fossil fuels include coal, oil, and natural gas, formed from the fossilized, buried remains of plants and animals that lived millions of years ago. These are said to contain high carbon content, and burning them causes what is known as the “greenhouse effect” in Earth’s atmosphere. A salient matter of discourse is the number of greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere – caused by both natural and human activities. It has been argued that most of these changes are caused by human activities, mainly burning fossil fuels which lead to global warming.  During the 2nd World Ocean Summit, Asia-Pacific, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) called for urgent action to maintain planetary health, which was described as essential for human and societal health and a pre-condition for climate-resilient development. Also, during COP27, the United Nations Secretary-General called for a continuous fight for “climate justice and ambition.” Amid these conversations, a Twitter user, @MikeHudema, who identifies as a climate campaigner, tweeted the relationship between industrial meat and climate change.  In the tweet, Hudema urged people to reduce their consumption of meat and dairy products. He said this would help combat the climate change challenge and soil, air, and water pollution. “Industrial meat is leaving a trail of destruction all over the world. One of the most useful things everyone can do to combat climate change, soil, air and water pollution, is to eat less meat and dairy,” his tweet reads.  But how true is this claim? DUBAWA consulted experts and studies on climate change to ascertain the veracity of the tweet. A 2014 report from the think tank Chatham House established a link between human consumption of meat and dairy products and climate change.  The report noted that greenhouse gas emissions from the livestock sector account for about 14.5% of the global total, more than direct emissions from the transport sector. However, a major concern in the study is the lack of concerted efforts to reduce the consumption of meat and dairy products. Seven years later, the IPCC, in its April 2022 climate change mitigation report, identified certain actions people can take to reduce the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that lead to global warming from academic papers.  While the scholars called for a dietary shift, they noted that emerging food technologies such as plant-based alternatives to animal-based food products and controlled environment agriculture could substantially reduce direct greenhouse gas emissions from food production. It was suggested that humans reduce the intake of meat, adding that diets high in plant protein and low in meat and dairy are associated with lower GHG emissions. They noted that agriculture is “a key driver of land-use change, causing deforestation and wetland drainage.”  Meanwhile, the United Nations noted that cattle used for both consumption and inedible outputs are responsible for about 65% of the livestock sector’s emissions, followed by pig meat, buffalo milk and meat, chicken meat and eggs and small ruminant milk and meat.  It further stated that 44 per cent of livestock emissions are from methane, 29 per cent from Nitrous Oxide and 27 per cent from Carbon Dioxide.  Writing on the effect of methane on climate change, the Environmental Defense Fund stated that methane has more than 80 times the warming power of carbon dioxide over the first 20 years after it reaches the atmosphere. DUBAWA spoke to Jennifer Uchendu Kalu, a climate change campaigner and Susty Vibes’ founder. Uchendu explained that there is indeed a link between the consumption of meat and dairy products and climate change. According to her, greenhouse gas emissions affect climate change, and gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) are all emitted into the atmosphere through livestock agriculture.   ” In fact, according to the FAO, 14.5% of all anthropogenic GHG emissions can be linked to livestock agriculture. This is the basis of this argument, and thus it is correct to say that livestock agriculture – in the way it is currently practised – can lead to global warming and, thus, climate change,” she said. “One school of thought believes that as humans, by continuously demanding meat and dairy products, we increase the need for the production and ultimately increase livestock agriculture-led emissions. These emissions come from feed production for the animals, their digestion processes (burping and excreting), and the transportation and processing of their by-products. Let us also not forget that emissions are also released when manures are stored,” Uchendu explained.  She, however, noted that beyond milk and meat production, there is also wool production, cheese and gelatin, which also play a role in climate change.  “A more overlooked factor is that these animals often graze on the land and further reduce the vegetation that could help mitigate the GHGs,” she said. Speaking on actions humans can take to help curb the effect of climate change, Uchendu expressed the belief that science and technology need to scale lower emissions pathways for the agriculture sector.  She suggested that research and development can be better explored to determine the best ways to convert the methane produced into biofuels and other useful energy products.  “These processes are still very small scale,” she said. “While I advocate for flexitarianism – where people generally reduce their meat and dairy consumption because of the current global limitations, I believe that the first option is the more realistic way to go as not everyone will want to switch to plant-based protein,” Uchendu added.  The claim that consuming meat and dairy products affect climate change is true. Experts have suggested, among other things, cutting down on the consumption of these products to mitigate their effect on climate change.

"Peter Obi, the Labour Party presidential candidate, delivered a presentation on Monday, January 16, 2023, at Chatham House in the United Kingdom (UK), speaking on how he intends to govern Nigeria if elected as president in next month’s election.","Peter Obi, the Labour Party presidential candidate, delivered a presentation on Monday, January 16, 2023, at Chatham House in the United Kingdom (UK), speaking on how he intends to govern Nigeria if elected as president in next month’s election. Themed “Nigeria’s 2023 elections: A vision for policy change and institutional reforms,” Mr Obi spoke and answered questions on issues ranging from poverty, education, economy, energy, oil and gas, insecurity, and restructuring.  The former governor of Anambra State is a third-party candidate and top choice in at least three opinion polls. This fact-check examines ten claims made by Mr Obi in his speech at the Chatham House London. Claim: Labour Party presidential candidate claimed that apart from Venezuela, Nigeria is the only OPEC nation not meeting its Quota. Verification: Latest data obtained from the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) shows that from September to December 2022, none of the OPEC member countries met its production quota. The OPEC member countries are Algeria, Angola, Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Venezuela. Verdict: False. Source: OPEC production data and monthly oil market report. Claim: Nigeria’s average life expectancy is about 50-something years, and the global average is 72 years.  Verification: World Bank’s latest (2020) data on life expectancy show that Nigeria’s average life expectancy is 55 years, and the global average is 72.9 years. Similarly, the United Nations World Population Prospects (UN WPP) report shows that life expectancy is 72 years. Verdict: True. Source: World Bank, UN WPP. CLAIM: 63 per cent of Nigerians are poor. Verification: Last November, the Federal Government of Nigeria, through the National Bureau of Statistics, published the results of the 2022 “Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) Survey,” saying 63 per cent of Nigerians (133 million people) are multidimensionally poor. Verdict: True. Source: National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). Claim: Nigeria has about 60 per cent of youth unemployment. Verification: The latest data on the NBS dashboard shows that Nigeria has 42.5 per cent youth unemployment. Verdict: False. Source: National Bureau of Statistics Claim: Peter Obi claimed he was awarded the Best governor in Millenium Development Goals (MDGs). Verification: Reports show that in August 2014, Mr Obi won the award for Mainstreaming the MDGs into Anambra State Development Agenda, 2006-2014. The award was presented to him at a Presidential Summit in Transcorp Nicon Hotel, Abuja.  Source: Daily Independent and Vanguard Claim: There are 20 million out-of-school children in Northern Nigeria. Verification: The total number of out-of-school children in Nigeria is estimated at 20 million, according to the latest global data on out-of-school children published in September 2022 by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO). Therefore, Mr Obi’s claim that northern Nigeria accounts for 20 million out-of-school children is false.  Verdict: False Source: UNESCO Global Education Monitoring Report (GEM) and Premium Times report. Claim: Seven local governments of Niger State are under the control of Bandits. Last year, the Niger State Governor, Abubakar Bello, revealed that seven out of the 25 local governments in the state are frequently under attack by bandits and terrorists. Multiple newspapers also reported that seven local governments of Niger state are under constant attack by bandits. Verdict: True Source: Thisday and The Punch newspaper. Claim: Nigeria’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita in 2015 was $2,550. Verification: World Bank’s data review shows that Nigeria’s GDP per capita in 2015 stood at  $2,679, contradicting Mr Obi’s claim. Verdict: False. Source: World Bank Claim: Nigeria’s total health budget was below N2.5 trillion from 2015 – 2021. Verification: A review of Nigeria’s health budget from 2015 – 2021 shows that the federal government allocated N2.50 trillion to the health sector. Verdict: Inaccurate.

But today (January 2023), with CBN ways and means, we owe over N75 trillion,” Mr Obi claimed. Verification: Nigeria’s public debt in December 2015 stood at N12.6 trillion, according to official data from Nigeria’s Debt Management Office. By September 2022, the Nigerian government’s domestic and foreign debts rose to N44 trillion. On the other hand, the CBN’s loans to the federal government stood at N23.8 trillion cumulatively. Therefore, Nigeria’s total debt combined with CBN’s loans is N67.8 trillion, not over N75 trillion, as claimed by Mr Obi. Verdict: False. Source: Debt Management Office and Premium Times.

"Claim: Dembo ‘By Force’ Bojang, national president of the National People’s Party (NPP), has said that all households in Kiang are electrified.","On December 27, 2022, the National People’s Party (NPP) national president, Dembo Bojang, popularly called Dembo By Force, stated that every household in Kiang, a village in the Lower River Division of The Gambia, is electrified.  He made this remark at the ruling party’s congress. The claim can be found in the 55 minutes of this video. He was speaking in the Mandinka language, and an interpretation was given in the Wolof language, which has been translated into the English language as follows; “In the Lower River Region, people used to ride bicycles from Kiang to Soma or Mansakonko to get ice blocks during the month of Ramadan. Today, every household in Kiang is electrified and equipped with electric appliances, including refrigerators.” Two thousand three hundred people have viewed the video, with 27 likes and three comments.   Electricity is a basic necessity of life, not a luxury. Goal seven of the UN Sustainable Development (SDG) calls for; “affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all” by 2030. One of the three core targets of the goal is to ensure “universal access to affordable, reliable, and modern energy services.” It is for this reason that the statement by the NPP national president that all communities in Kiang have electricity became a subject of interest and investigation by DUBAWA.  It is important to note that on November 28, 2020, President Adama Barrow inaugurated a US$22.5 Million Electricity Expansion Project as part of the National Electricity Road Map for Universal Electricity Access. The first phase of this project covered 14 communities in Kiang. In his inaugural speech, Barrow made the following remarks: “The implementation of this first phase started in 2017, and the project covers seventy-seven (77) communities. Fourteen (14) of these are in Kiang, and sixty-three (63) are in the West Coast Region. Altogether, the range targets 5000 meters in Kiang and over 20,000 meters in the West Coast Region. The project’s second phase will cover additional communities in Kiang Central, Kiang West and Kiang East by early 2021.”  However, the second phase of this project began in 2022 instead and is expected to be completed in March 2023.  Although some communities in Kiang have benefited from the Electricity Expansion Project, DUBAWA has confirmed, through some natives of Kiang, that at least 16 communities in Kiang do not currently have electricity.  “Big communities like Jali, Karantaba, and Tankular currently do not have electricity. Joli, Kemoro, Burong, Santaba, Taaborankoto, Bankuling, Kantong Kunda, Jamari, Sandeng, Manarr, Janneh Kunda, and Battelling. This is Kiang West alone. There are 33% of villages, and more than 50% of households do not have electricity. The whole of Kabada communities in Kiang does not have at all,” said Landing Sanneh, Chairman of Mansakonko Area Council.  There are plans to electrify most communities in Kiang. However, the assertion made by the national president of NPP that electricity has been installed in all households in Kiang is not true. The claim, therefore, is false.

Claim: A viral post on Facebook states that the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) will introduce a unified ATM card and suspend all banks’ ATM cards currently used by customers.,"Claim: A viral post on Facebook states that the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) will introduce a unified ATM card and suspend all banks’ ATM cards currently used by customers. Verdict: TRUE. The Central Bank of Nigeria launched a domestic card scheme to kickstart January 2023. The scheme is aimed at unifying payments in Nigeria and promoting financial inclusion. However, the deployment of cards under this scheme has not started. As the global financial space moves to deepen financial inclusiveness and promote cashless transactions, apex banks are further moving with the tide by implementing innovative solutions for seamless transactions. Recently, a viral post shared by Oluwatofunmi Wisdom on a popular Facebook group with over 400,000 Facebook users stated that Nigeria’s apex bank would, on January 16, 2023, introduce a unified ATM card and suspend all other cards. Reacting to this post, Ohegam Iyoba Fruitfulness asked questions on how this will affect National Identity Cards and wondered how this move will affect his transactions. Other Facebook users in the comment thread shared the same scepticism with many questions begging for answers. The significance of this claim and the conflicting comments that have followed encouraged the need to verify this assertion and set the records straight to enlighten Nigerians. A quick google check revealed in a report that the Central Bank of Nigeria, in collaboration with the Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System, launched the National Domestic Card Scheme. The scheme is expected to unify payments in Nigeria and bring more unbanked Nigerians in the informal sector into the financial system. The card is also expected to rival heavyweights such as Mastercard and Visa. Nwanisobi Osita, Director of Corporate Communications at the CBN, in a statement, said, “Domesticating our card scheme also enhances data sovereignty, enabling the development of locally relevant products and services and reduces demands on foreign exchange.” This announcement was also reported by Premium Times, Vanguard, in October 2022 and recently by Punch and the Sun News online.  In a phone interview, Emmanuel Idenyi Shaibu, a banking sector analyst, confirmed that the scheme kick-started on January 16th. However, he stated that commencement and disbursement would kickstart after the Central Bank of Nigeria agreed with the bankers’ committee. According to him, the new cards will not phase out the old cards. He further disclosed that the card would be independent of Visa and Mastercard while noting that the only challenge would be issues around the unified card being compromised. Emmanuel Idenyi urged Nigerians to use these unified cards when they become accessible on accounts meant for just daily transactions. Based on official statements from the Central Bank of Nigeria and the NIBSS, the new debit card scheme starts on January 16, 2023. Still, there are no confirmations about when customers will use the new cards and the current cards will cease functioning.

The Hon Minister of @NigeriaFMYS @SundayDareSD and @thenff needs to do something urgent!”  Another Twitter user, Omono Okonkwo (@omonookonkwo), called out the tweet as false. “This is not Peter Rufai, this is Peter Fregene, and he is 75 years old.” The collage pictures used in the tweet are originally traced to a Facebook post by Abdulrazak Garba and have been shared here, here and even here with the same alleged narrative.  Peter Rufai is a former Super Eagles goalkeeper. Nicknamed “Dodo Mayana.” Mr Rufai represented Nigeria at two FIFA World Cups and was part of the AFCON winning squad in Tunisia 94.  His popularity and immense contribution to Nigerian soccer don’t seem to match the current allegation, a more reason why the narrative is arousing so much attention.  DUBAWA first separated images in the collage into independent copies, into “picture one”  and “picture two”. The man in a wheelchair wearing green, and the first one with the goalkeeper wearing a yellow jersey.  A Google reverse image search of the image of the goalkeeper dressed in yellow (picture one) showed that he is actually Peter Rufai. Further search on the image leads to the website of Getty Images, an American stock supplier that commissions photographers to cover major sporting events. A search of the name Peter Rufai on Getty’s website brings up several images of the same player, in the same yellow long-sleeve, with two lines running by the side. The picture was taken during Nigeria’s opening match with Spain at the 1998 FIFA World Cup, hosted by France, where Peter Rufai featured prominently.  A reverse google search of the second image with the man in a wheelchair, wearing green, brings up the name Peter Fregene.  Peter Fregene is also a former Nigerian international goalkeeper who was part of the 1968 Olympic Team in Mexico.  Nicknamed the “flying cat,” Mr Fregene, 76, played for stationery Stores of Lagos, where he won the Nigerian FA Cup. He was the country’s first-choice goalkeeper from 1968 to 1971. A further search of the name leads to an article written by Segun Odegbami in March 2019 and published by Completesports, where he revealed that Fregene has been bedridden for more than two decades.  Another search on the name on Facebook brings back a video on Rero TV, of Pete Fregene and his wife pleading for financial assistance.  All efforts to contact Mr Rufai turned abortive; however, reports from credible sources highlight Mr Rufai’s alleged situation. In fact, Mr Rufai was part of the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential campaign held in Kano on December 9th. A report by Punch Newspaper details Mr Rufai’s involvement in the campaign alongside other prominent retired football players.  A careful understudy of Mr Rufai’s official Instagram handle shows the former footballer is active and has not posted or shared anything that portrays him ill. On New year (2023), the former short-stopper shared a picture of himself in a well and hearty condition.  The tweet claiming that Peter Rufai is sick and bedridden is misleading. The image used in the narrative is of Peter Fregene, who has been in a wheelchair for a long time.

"Claim: Nigeria had the highest inflation rate under Obasanjo-Atiku, not under Buhari.","The official spokesperson of the All Progressives Congress (APC)’s Presidential Campaign Council, Festus Keyamo, has lashed out at the presidential aspirant, Atiku Abubakar, and his party, the People Democratic Party (PDP), declaring that the highest inflation rate in the history of the country was recorded during the latter’s administration as vice-president to former president Olusegun Obasanjo.  Mr Keyamo made the assertion in an interview with the news channel, AriseTV on Monday, January 16, 2023. He was also reported by Vanguard newspaper to have said that the inflation rate witnessed under the Buhari-led administration isn’t the highest in the country’s history. “This is not the highest inflation rate. In 2005, under Obasanjo and Atiku, we had a 28 per cent inflation rate. Under Obasanjo and Atiku, we had the highest,” he was quoted as saying by the newspaper. This is happening in the aftermath of a series of political jibes between both parties, who have been at loggerheads since the realisation of each other’s strength on the political scene. Due to the sensitivity of the matter, and the underlying critical perception it could have even on the upcoming 2023 elections, DUBAWA decided to look into it. The former president, Olusegun Obasanjo and Atiku Abubakar, his vice president, ruled Nigeria between 1999 and 2007. Within their two terms, it was in 2001 that the economy experienced an ascending inflation rate of 18.87%, with an 11.94% annual rate increase.   Presently, the country’s inflation rate at the end of December 2022  is 21.34, dropping a little and terminating a 17-year rate increase of the previous month. An inquiry into macro trends gave the analytical list of the inflation rates in Nigeria since her independence in 1960. A closer study of the statistical information revealed that since Nigeria became a sovereign state, the country witnessed the highest inflation rate in 1995, at a critical mark of 72.84%, with an annual increase rate of 15.80% in the previous year. Also, WorldData info presents a corresponding report about inflation rates in Nigeria, in comparison with the United States and Europe. In the report, 1995 is also recorded as having the highest inflation rate, 72.84%, and the only one in the country’s history. Mr Keyamo’s assertion is wrong. In the history of inflation rates in Nigeria, 1995 witnessed the highest rate of inflation, which was four years before former president Olusegun Obasanjo took over power as president of Nigeria.

In a report on ThisDay, the National Commissioner of INEC in charge of Voter Education and Information, Barr Festus Okoye, stated that the presidential election winner next year must score the highest votes and the required 25 per cent in two-thirds of the 36 states of the federation. “By Section 134 of the constitution, where there are more than two presidential candidates, for a presidential candidate to be declared duly elected, he must secure the highest number of votes cast at the election; and not less than a quarter of the votes cast at the election in each of at least two-thirds of all the states in the federation and the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja.” In the 2007 presidential election, Mr Obasanjo supported the then-former governor of Katsina state, Umaru Musa Yar’Adua, who emerged victorious. In 2011, Mr Obasanjo backed Goodluck Jonathan, who later won the election. In the next election (the 2015 general election), Mr Obasanjo endorsed the then flag bearer of the APC, Muhammadu Buhari, who also emerged victorious in the election. However, in 2019, the former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar, who contested on the platform of the PDP, lost the election to the incumbent President, Muhammadu Buhari, despite Obasanjo’s support.  Based on the above, it is misleading to say that everyone Obasanjo has ever endorsed has won the presidential election.

Claim: A viral image showing different thumbprint positions classify some as valid and others as invalid.,"As February 25, 2023 election draws near, different information will be shared on voting to sensitise the public, but some of this information may be misleading.  Recently, images of different fingerprints have been shared on WhatsApp, Twitter and Facebook on the right and wrong placement of the fingerprint.  According to this image, only fingerprints within the fingerprint compartment in front of a party’s logo are valid. That is, if your fingerprint crosses or touches the line of the compartment, it becomes invalid.  While many believe this and have gone ahead to reshare, some Twitter users disagree with the fingerprint placement described as invalid, noting a person’s vote only becomes invalid when it becomes difficult to determine which compartment it belongs to. The significance of this assertion and the need to clarify this confusion and set the records straight prompted us to verify.  A fingerprint is an impression or mark made on a surface by the inner part of the top joint of the thumb. Its unique pattern of whorls and lines is used to identify individuals.  Part four, section 52, subsection two, of the 2022 Electoral Act states that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) shall use indelible ink for any thumb mark by voters on ballot papers. Subsection one of this same part notes that “Where a voter makes any writing or mark on a ballot paper by which he or she may be identified, the such ballot paper shall be rejected provided that any print resulting from the staining of the thumb of the voter in the voting compartment shall not be or be deemed to be a mark of identification.” INEC has clarified that any finger can be used to thumbprint in the general election. According to INEC’s manual for election officers, indelible ink must be applied on the cuticle of the appropriate thumb/finger of the voter’s hand according to the type of election.  For general elections, it would be applied to any of the applicable five fingers of a voter, but in the case of Stand-alone Elections, it would be applied to the left thumb of a voter). We reached out to INEC’s national commissioner for information, Festus Okoye, on the issue, and he shared the commission’s 2022 manual for election officers.  According to this manual, only thumbprints placed equally across two political parties’ compartments or on multiple compartments constitute an invalid vote. Ballots without any fingerprint or with the voter’s name in place of a thumbprint also constitute an invalid vote. On the other hand, fingerprints placed within a party’s thumbprint compartment, on a party’s logo, or between a party’s logo and its thumbprint compartment constitute a valid vote.  Voting at your polling unit on election day will follow this procedure: Step 1– Join the queue at your Polling Unit (PU), where an INEC official will check if you are at the correct polling unit and confirm that the permanent Voters Card (PVC) presented belongs to you. Step 2– An INEC official will confirm if your PVC is genuine using the card reader. You will also be asked to place your finger on the card reader. Step 3– An INEC official will ask for your PVC and confirm if you are listed on the Voters Register. Afterwards, your name will be ticked and indelible ink applied to the cuticle of your finger. Step 4– The Presiding officer will stamp, sign and endorse your ballot paper. You will be given the ballot paper rolled with the printed side inwards and directed to the voting cubicle. Step 5– Once in the cubicle, stain your finger with the ink given and mark the compartment for your preferred candidate/party. After this, you must roll the ballot paper in the manner you were given and flatten it. Step 6– Leave the voting cubicle and drop the ballot paper in the ballot box in full view of people at the PU. Step 7– Leave the PU or wait, if you so choose, in an orderly and peaceful manner, to watch the process up to the declaration of the result. Our findings show that all thumbprint positions in the viral image constitute valid votes, contrary to the assertion that some are valid while others are not.  I want to know how this amounts to false information. The voting process classifies thumb prints that crosses the lines into the box of another political party as invalid. The national Orientation Agency has sensitised people not to let their thumb print cross the line, or fold the ballot paper in a way that makes it possible or likely to allow the ink smear another point or box. From the samples classified invalid in this picture, I’m trying to make voters careful. So how’s this a false information? This your post is a fake news. Stop confusing people in the media. Check INEC’s website for true information about invalid post and stop misleading with fake information. I advice you delete this post. The true source for validating the invalid thumbprinting is INEC’s official website and news pages. this update is false, it has been clearly and repeatedly stated by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) that a thumbprint which crosses into the boundary box of another party is invalid, this flagging of accurate posts by a supposed fact checking body is very dangerous considering the fact that Nigeria has 1 more weekend of elections to go I wonder how a sensitization post amount to false information. Is it that the fact checker just flags the post as false information without reading the wording that accompanies it? If it is human that fact-checked it go and read again and correct yourself. If it is machine then there should be a correction in the programming of the machine. Thank you. If you are here, it’s because Instagram brought you here. Let them know that this fact check is wrong by providing feedback. So how are you a fact checker when you don’t have FACTS?..What is false in this post?.Can we for once not be biased in issues regarding elections in this country?? It’s disgusting to see yet again Facebook working as a tool of oppression by power grabbers in Nigeria. This is legitimate information put out to sensitize people on the right way to vote but it’s being tagged false? Feel free to take any actions including knocking me off your compromised app. I’m better off without your falsehood anyway. Eeeeewww!!! This post was not met to tell the public or miss informed the public that it was invalid vote, for as at when this post was made, elections has not been conducted in Nigeria. A thousand time no, but rather it was a post meant to guide all electorate on the appropriate way to thumbprint so as to avoid invalid vote. Thank you. Any thumbprint that crosses the ilne is invalid even as seen in our presidential election, I wonder why the post should be tagged as fake Are you people insane? Don’t flag my posts with your stupidity! Nothing false about it,its merely voter education to guide on how to thumbprint properly.

"Claim: President Muhammadu Buhari did not endorse the APC Presidential Candidate, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, at the party’s rally in Yola, Adamawa State.","The APC Presidential campaign was flagged off in Yola, Adamawa State, on Monday, January 9, 2023. And for the first time since the commencement of the APC Presidential Campaign in Jos last year, President Muhammadu Buhari was in attendance. A few hours after the campaign, a Twitter handle, NKEM #PeterObi2023 (@Nkemchor), tweeted that President Muhammadu Buhari did not endorse the candidacy of Bola Tinubu, his party’s Presidential flag-bearer.  The handle made the post referring to a one-minute, two seconds video of the event credited to another Twitter handle, @MuchTalksBlog1, operated by Chinaza #PeterObi-HypeMan. As of Wednesday, January 11, 2023, the tweet had over 82,000 views and was retweeted 1,298 times. Before the Yola campaign, there had been insinuations in some quarters that President Buhari avoided campaigning for the APC Presidential Candidate due to some alleged reservations, hence his frequent international engagements that coincided with campaigns.  Due to the issue’s sensitivity in this electioneering period and the engagement the tweet has attracted, DUBAWA decided to verify the claim. A keyword search revealed that President Buhari did endorse Tinubu at the Yola rally. A one hour, 23 minutes YouTube video of the APC presidential rally in Yola uploaded by the TVC and shorter versions by Channels Television and TV360 also reported President Buhari speaking in favour of Tinubu and canvassing for him and his running mate, Kashim Shettima. In addition, on President Muhammadu Buhari’s verified Twitter handle, he announced the APC Presidential flag-bearer, alongside his running mate, as someone who can be trusted. Our search did not lead to any report from any known credible news platform in agreement with the claim.  While watching and listening to the more extended version of the APC Presidential Campaign in Adamawa, we observed that the video shared by Nkemchor_ captured only an aspect of what President Buhari said. The creator of the video cut that part of the video to suit his agenda.  In the one hour twenty-three minutes live coverage video posted on YouTube by TVC, President Buhari was heard saying that he was in Adamawa mainly to present the APC Presidential flag-bearer, Bola Tinubu, (he did this by raising the candidate’s hand) and the State Governorship Candidate, Aishatu Binani. He thereafter presented the party’s flag to both candidates. Then, he urged the people to vote for APC, mentioning the areas of interest of the party. Afterwards, he advised people on the kind of candidates they should vote for.  The advice on the kind of candidates to vote for was used in the video shared by the Twitter handle. President Buhari also spoke in the Hausa language. His speech in Hausa, translated by a native speaker of the language, revealed that the President urged the people to vote for Tinubu as he would deliver on the party’s mandate. The President also canvassed for votes for Aishatu Binani, the APC Governorship Candidate in Adamawa State. The claim that President Buhari did not endorse Tinubu is false, as our findings confirm Buhari’s endorsement of Bola Tinubu’s candidacy.   ”",FALSE,20/01/2023,https://dubawa.org/buhari-endorsed-tinubu-at-adamawa-rally-contrary-to-twitter-users-narrative/
Claim: A user on Twitter stated that the presentation ceremony of Cristiano Ronaldo at Al-Nassr FC  was viewed more than the FIFA World Cup finals in Qatar.,"Towards the tail end of 2022, Christiano Ronaldo made a career move to leave his Manchester United club for a Saudi Arabian club, Al-Nassr FC. The deal was reported to be worth millions of Euros. Since the club announced his arrival, football fans have been anticipating the unveiling of the veteran footballer at his new club. On Thursday, January 5, just two days after Ronaldo was unveiled at the Al-Nassr stadium, a Twitter user, Twilight (@the_marcoli_boy), claimed that Ronaldo’s unveiling event had more views than the World Cup final. He went ahead to say that Ronaldo is more than football (banter). “Ronaldo’s Al-Nassr presentation had more views than the World Cup Final. He is bigger than Football🐐.” While most users perceived the tweet as harmless football talk that idolises Ronaldo’s legendary football career, the comparison to the World Cup finals attracted substantial interest.  A poke through Google search to see if this is the case of an isolated claim threw up an interesting result. Around the time the tweet was made, many blogs had picked the same claim, distributing it all over the search engine. A look at a few of them pointed towards another account of an acclaimed journalist, Pedro Sepúlveda. His tweet, which was made a few hours after @the_marcoli_boy’s post, tagged the official handle of the FIFA World Cup as a show of confidence in the statement. The tweet attracted diverse opinions; while some users believed the claim, others expressed their scepticism. A Twitter user, @Rose31999202, described Ronaldo as a king deserving the attention. “It’s a CR7 effect. We love our King.” In his post, DUBAWA noticed that the claimant never mentioned the names of the 40 channels that screened the said presentation. He also did not define the channels to know if they were TV stations or YouTube channels, making his post a conjecture at best.  Nonetheless, a report by Trenddetail mentioned that five channels (Saudi sports, 1SSC Saudi sports channels, Bein Sports news channel, Abu Dhabi Sports Channel, and Sports TV Portuguese channel) would telecast the presentation. However, still, there was no tally of the number of viewers.  El-Nassr‘s presentation video on its YouTube channel had less than 50,000 views when this report was filed.  The world’s population, according to the UN, is 8 billion. To say three billion watched Ronaldo’s debut would mean more than 37% of the world’s population were connected. There is no evidence to back this. Although FIFA is yet to release the official figure of viewers who tuned into the 2022 World Cup final, a report showed that BBC streaming service alone had 10 million views of the final. In 2018, 1.12 billion people watched the final match between France and Croatia. With the hype around the Qatar campaign being a better edition in terms of engagement, the viewers’ participation in 2022 may be slightly higher. Additionally, there was no report from any credible media about this unprecedented phenomenon. This is very unusual considering the media attention Ronaldo has amassed since announcing his intentions to join the Saudi Arabian Club.  There is no sufficient evidence or reliable source backing the claim that Ronaldo’s unveiling at his new club, Al-Nassr, had more views than Qatar’s 2022 world cup finals. This tweet is misleading.

"Claim: “All Countries that passed the MCC scorecard received hundreds of millions of dollars, except Liberia.”","A staunch critic of the Coalition for Democratic Change (CDC) government under the leadership of President George Weah has claimed that all countries that passed the just released MCC scorecard received hundreds of millions of United States dollars except Liberia. According to Henry Costa, Liberia missed out on the MCC grant due to the poor leadership credentials of President George Weah. He made the claim when he appeared on a local radio talk show, the OKay Morning Rush, aired on Okay 99.5FM upon returning to the country.   The show, which was carried live on the station’s official Facebook page, had 1.2k comments, 17.1k viewers and over 550 emojis.  The assertion was made at 51:34-47 seconds within the over one-hour show on Tuesday, January 3, 2023. Since the issue of the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) has become a talking point for  Liberians, especially after the first and highest pass made by the Liberian government under the Weah-led regime, DUBAWA decided to subject the claim by Henry Costa to scrutiny.  The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) is an innovative and independent U.S. foreign assistance agency that is helping lead the fight against global poverty. The MCC was created by the U.S. Congress in January 2004 with strong bipartisan support and has changed the conversation on how best to deliver smart U.S. foreign assistance by focusing on good policies, country ownership, and results. MCC provides time-limited grants by promoting economic growth, reducing poverty, and strengthening institutions of countries that are deemed to have passed the MCC scorecards. Liberia joined the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) in 2006 under President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf’s leadership; since then, the country has been a part of the program. Under the presidency of  Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, Liberia passed the scorecards on two occasions, in 2013 and 2017. Here are the 12-year scorecards of Liberia under President Sirleaf. After passing the MCC in 2013, the Government of Liberia and the United States Government, through the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) Liberia in October 2015, signed a US$257million compact with a direct focus on rebuilding the country’s broken electricity sector and the construction of a new 48-inch diameter Raw Water Pipeline between Mt. Coffee and the White Plains Water Treatment Plant to replace a damaged 36-inch diameter pipeline that had not been in use since Liberia’s civil war.  The benefits from this compact ended on January 20, 2021.  Under the George Weah-led administration, the Liberian government in 2022/2023 passed 12 out of 20 indicators of the MCC scorecard. This pass received massive media reports through the instrumentality of the government of Liberia, as seen here and here. Though Liberia is part of the countries that passed the recently released scorecard of the MCC, Liberia is not among the countries eligible to benefit from the grant.  One hundred countries passed the 2022/2023 MCC scorecard. Out of this number, only  62 countries were eligible for the grant under the low-income category, while under the lower middle-income category, four countries were eligible for the grants: Algeria, Eswatini, Indonesia and Samoa. Even though 62 countries have been deemed eligible, only a few were announced as grant beneficiaries. In a December 14, 2022, statement issued by United States President Joseph Biden on behalf of the MCC’s Board, $1.2 billion was announced for grant beneficiaries.  Liberia was omitted from the list of beneficiaries, and so were other countries.  Biden said in connection with the announcement of grants, “Along with selecting countries for new grant programs, MCC’s Board also reselected Côte d’Ivoire as eligible for a concurrent regional compact program; Mozambique, Sierra Leone, and Zambia for compact development; and Kiribati for threshold program development. The Board also reaffirmed its support for continuing compact development in Belize. MCC regularly reviews its partner countries’ policy performance throughout developing and implementing a compact or threshold program.”  Per this statement, Liberia was not the only country left out of receiving the grant from the MCC. Countries like Nigeria, Somalia, Malawi,  Lesotho, Ghana, Cape Verde and many others were not selected, even though all of them were eligible.  Still unsatisfied with the statement, DUBAWA reached out to the head of the MCC-Liberia compact, Mr Monie R. Captan, to find out why  Liberia was omitted. Mr Monie R. Captan told DUBAWA in a WhatsApp conversation that when a country becomes eligible, it does not mean it will be selected automatically, adding that there are limited funds and selection is competitive among those deemed to be eligible. Mr Captain further stated, “the selection is not every year, so it is possible we might get selected next year. Each compact has a separate project. The last compact had to do with energy, and the compact closed in 2021 when we completed the project.”       Based on all of the research conducted by DUBAWA with evidence from the Millennium Challenge Corporation official site, it is safe to say that the claim made by Henry Costa that Liberia is the only country that did not receive an MCC grant after passing its scorecard is false.

"Claim: A TikTok user stated that Bola Tinubu, in an APC meeting, told his supporters to snatch ballot boxes during elections, with an attached video.","Nigerians are a few weeks away from electing the country’s next president. Therefore, candidates’ supporters have taken the centre stage in campaigns both online and offline. Intending to convince the general populace, supporters share information, gaffes, and activities on opposing candidates. As a result, a TikTok user Mr_Noble Godson (@nobleboss8), shared a supposed leaked video of Tinubu encouraging his supporters to snatch ballot boxes at the elections. The video was also found on Twitter posted by Honyfactory (@Honyfactory), who also tagged the video as a leaked one. Reacting to the video, @cent3ric noted it is impossible to do that in the elections. “He can only do that in Lagos, not Nigeria, him never see craze 😂,” he commented. Another Twitter user, O.G.B (@ogbonna_ugwuowo), credited the video as a reason the presidential candidate did not sign the peace accord. “Now you see why he refused to sign a peace accord,” he tweeted. As of the reporting time, the video has attracted over 4,000 views, 300 retweets, 70 comments, and 200 likes on Twitter, while it has over 900 views on TikTok. This video was also made to WhatsApp as users shared the screenshot on their WhatsApp status.  Due to its virality and potential to contribute or lead to electoral violence, DUBAWA chose to fact-check the assertion. DUBAWA listened to the video and could not find the keywords “ballot box” in Tinubu’s speech. We also noticed that the video started halfway, meaning an extended version exists.  “Study the anthropology of it. Where are we? Political power is not going to be served in a restaurant. It is not served a la carte. It is what we are doing. It’s being determined to do it at all costs. Fight for it! Grab it! Snatch it and run with it!” Those were the words of the All Progressives Congress presidential candidate in the 48-second video. We also found a report by the Gazette in December 2022, pointing at the same video and claiming to be about Tinubu’s ballot-snatching encouragement. “Power must be grabbed, snatched at all cost: Tinubu,” the headline reads. According to the Gazette, Tinubu remained in the United Kingdom after attending a Chatham House engagement earlier that week. The man at the end of the video was the one recording the video, and we found his name Mustapha Abdullahi, Deputy Chairman of the British APC, via a Google Reverse Image search. In a report by NNN News Nigeria, he discussed Tinubu’s Chatham House. A keyword search on YouTube led to different duration of the same video shared by different platforms a month ago, from OmoEluBlogTV to Prime Reporters News, to DIVINEVIBESTV, among many others.  We also found that the video was shared a week ago by NIGERIA POLITICS TCGM, noting that the Bishop of the Worldwide Anglican Church in Nigeria, Bishop Seun Adeoye, is calling on security agents to invite and interrogate the APC candidate over alleged comments.  These longer versions of the video show Mr Tinubu comparing the democracy and economy of Nigeria to that of India. He noted India has the largest democracy in the world and the richest middle class in the world.  “…they didn’t do it. We won’t attach everything to destiny; you grab it. We are struggling for it now. What? Power. Power, political, power, electricity. Electricity has been the most important discovery for humanity in the last 1000 years. Go and study anthropology.” This was the earlier statement before the one captured in the TikTok video. This reveals his comments had nothing to do with ballot box snatching or election day.  Our findings show that the video conversations did not mention ballot boxes on election day. Although the presidential candidate encouraged his supporters to ‘snatch’ and ‘grab’ power at all costs, it does not imply that he directed them to snatch ballot boxes on the day of the election. Hence, this claim is false. ",public,16/01/2023,https://dubawa.org/tinubu-did-not-ask-supporters-to-snatch-ballot-boxes-as-stated-by-tiktok-user/
"Claim: “We (CDC) took over from a place where they (Past Government, UP) had only US$ 27 million for public sector investment.”","With less than ten months to Liberia’s Presidential and legislative elections, members of the Coalition for Democratic Change (CDC) headed by President George Weah have been trumpeting the achievements of the regime in the last five years with reasons why they think the government should be retained in office. The latest such campaign was displayed recently by Assistant Minister for Planning at the Ministry of Finance and Development Planning (MFDP), Benedict Kolubah when he engaged the secretary of the opposition and immediate past governing party, Unity Party (UP), headed by then President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf. On January 2, 2023, the two gentlemen faced each other on a local radio station, Okay 99.5FM, in a debate to compare and contrast the achievements of the two regimes. The show was live on the media outlet’s official Facebook page with over 730 comments, 241 emojis, 7.3k viewers, and 90 shares. During the debate, Assistant Minister Benedict Kolubah claimed that the Coalition for Democratic Change (CDC) took over the country from the Unity party at a point when Public Sector investment was US$ 27 million.   Assistant Minister Kolubah made the claim at 2:10:40-51 seconds of the over two hours show.   The Assistant Finance Minister said, “we picked up from a system without space to invest in the country. The space on the budget was just for recurrent expenditure. We picked up from a place where there was only US$ 27 million for public sector investment.” Assistant Minister Kolubah indicated that the Unity Party-led government inherited a broken economy at the time. He indicated they had all the opportunities to improve the country’s economy but did not do enough in the country’s and its people’s best interest. Due to the importance of the claim in relation to the country’s progress under the Weah-led administration, DUBAWA embarked on an investigation to ascertain the facts about the claim. Public Sector Investment is the expenditure incurred by the government in areas such as infrastructure, agriculture, housing and other related areas. It is important to state that the Weah-led CDC government was sworn into office in 2018 after winning the 2017 General elections.  To investigate the statement, DUBAWA needed to compare data from the final year of the Sirleaf-Johnson administration to that of the first year of the CDC administration. DUBAWA first contacted the claimant through a WhatsApp chat for evidence of his claim. But the Assistant Minister, Benedict Kolubah, provided DUBAWA with a sheet of paper through WhatsApp showing, among other things, a declining trend in the Public Sector Investment Plan (PSIP) from 2013/2014 to 2017-2018, as seen below. Assistant Minister Kolubah also referred DUBAWA to the Ministry of Finance and Development Planning’s official website to verify his claim.  DUBAWA then visited the official website of the Ministry of Finance.  According to the last budget, 2017/2018, under the previous administration headed by Ms Sirleaf, public sector investment for the fiscal year 2016/2017 was at US$62,398,129 and 2017/18 was at 55,280,850, contrary to what the Assistant Minister claimed as seen below: This information is found on page 550 of the country’s National Budget for the fiscal year 2017-2018 under Annex four with the caption Public Sector Investment plan. It contains every item and all its allocations.  DUBAWA also pulled out the first budget prepared under the CDC-led administration in 2018-2019, and according to that budget, PSIP was placed at US$58,762,836. Based on evidence from the country’s National Budget for the fiscal year 2017-2018 and the Minister’s evidence provided, it is safe to say that the assertion made by Assistant Minister Benedict Kolubah that Public sector Investment was at US$27million when the CDC-led government took over from the then Unity Party government is false. It was at US$62,398,129 in 2016/2017 and US$55,280,850 in 2017/18. ",FALSE,12/01/2023,https://dubawa.org/public-sector-investment-not-us27million-when-george-weah-became-liberias-president/
"Claim: Bashir Ahmad, special assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari, claims Senator Aisha Binani will become the first female governor in Nigeria if she is voted in as the next governor of Adamawa State.","As Nigerians prepare for the presidential elections next month, the people of Adamawa are also preparing for the governorship election in the state. One of the major candidates is Senator Aisha Binani, who resigned as Adamawa’s All Progressives Congress (APC) campaign coordinator a few months ago. Recently, the Special Assistant to the President on digital communications, Bashir Ahmad (@BashirAhmaad), shared on his Twitter page that if Ms Binani emerges as the next governor of Adamawa State, she would be the first female governor in Nigeria. Reacting to his post, Chima Obi (@ChimaOdo) commended APC for presenting a female candidate. He tweeted, “I applaud the APC for once in their lifetime, a woman as the guber candidate? I love that. But she will lose.” Joseph (@Sanjos_bran) opposed the Special Assistant’s comment on the first female governor claim. He commented, “Obi had produced one before – Dame Virgy Etiaba, Nov 2006. stop this first female governor in Nigeria [sic].” As of the time of publication, the post has attracted over 90,000 views, 150 comments, 300 retweets and 1,000 likes. In view of conflicting comments, DUBAWA chose to fact-check this claim to set the records straight and educate Nigerians. DUBAWA carried out a quick Google check of the first female governor in Nigeria and found a report by Voice of Nigeria where the current governor of Anambra, Prof Charles Soludo, congratulated Ms Virginia Etiaba on her 80th birthday. “Governor Soludo Congratulates Nigeria’s First Female Governor At 80,” the headline reads. Similarly, in 2019, President Muhammadu Buhari congratulated Ms Virginia Etiaba on her 77th birthday, where the president described her as “the good teacher who completely altered the history of Nigeria as first female governor between November 2006 and February 2007.” In 2006, Sahara Reporters reported that the then-governor of Anambra, Peter Obi, had been impeached for ‘impropriety in office.’ During his impeachment period, his deputy, Ms Virginia Etiaba, became the first female governor of Nigeria. Mail and Guardian reported that the chief judge of Anambra swore in Obi’s deputy, Virginia Etiaba, to replace him even though she had refused the job, pledging loyalty to Obi. After three months, Peter Obi was reinstated as the governor of Anambra State, Reuters reported. His return saw Ms Virginia return to her role as the deputy governor after a stint as the governor of the state for three months. Due to Peter Obi’s impeachment as the governor of Anambra state, his deputy, Ms Virginia Etiaba, became the first female governor in Nigeria. Although she was not voted in directly from the polls, she served the people of Anambra in the absence of the elected governor. Hence, the claim is false.

Claim: A web-based message circulating on WhatsApp claims that INEC is still recruiting ad-hoc staff for the upcoming 2023 elections.,"Claim: A web-based message circulating on WhatsApp claims that INEC is still recruiting ad-hoc staff for the upcoming 2023 elections.   Verdict: The claim that INEC is still recruiting ad hoc staff for the upcoming 2023 elections is false. The link shared alongside the message is malicious and used by fraudsters to extort users’ personal information. Also, INEC has officially closed the recruitment of ad-hoc staff for the 2023 elections since December 14, 2022. As the 2023 general election gets closer, stakeholders, including the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), have continued to prepare for the election that will be held between February 25 and March 11, 2023. As the stakeholders continue to work toward a credible poll, scammers have also taken advantage of the season to prey on the data of vulnerable Nigerians who wish to serve as umpires during the elections. In September 2022, INEC called for applications from qualified citizens to apply as ad-hoc staff with the commission during the election. In a statement on its website, the commission directed prospective applicants to register between September 14 and December 14, 2022, through its Portal for Recruitment of Election Staff (PRES). Since the launch of the recruitment process by INEC in September, different phishing websites have sprung up to steal data of unsuspecting public members willing to participate in the general election as INEC ad-hoc staff. As announced, the INEC recruitment portal has been shut down and has remained inaccessible since December 14, 2022. However, between December 31, 2022, and January 1, 2023, multiple WhatsApp groups were rife with messages about INEC ad-hoc staff recruitment shared by multiple users.  The message contains a link that allows users to register as INEC ad-hoc staff ahead of the 2023 elections.  The first stage of the application contained in the said link requires users to provide their details like name, email etc. After the personal details are provided, the applicant is redirected to a different page requiring him or her to share the message with 15 friends or five groups on WhatsApp before accessing their Appointment ID. After this stage, users are taken to another page where it is stated that the appointment ID has been sent to their email address with an option to ‘print form’  that returns an empty web page. In an interview with one of the users who shared the message and completed the form, it was gathered that no acknowledgement slip or anything was available after completing the application process on the website. DUBAWA finds this to be unusual and suspicious, a typical scheme used by scammers to extort personal information of online users.   DUBAWA first searched for the acclaimed website on Whois. WHOIS is a query and response protocol widely used for querying databases that store the registered users or assignees of an Internet resource, such as a domain name, an IP address block, or an autonomous system. The information on the website provided by Whois returned very little information about the website. Most of the information sought returned as ‘redacted for privacy’, indicating that it has been deliberately concealed.  DUBAWA also made attempts to fill out the acclaimed form. Alarmingly, access to the next page was granted without providing email or contact details. This is not the case with the original INEC website, where users are only granted access to the next page when they complete the initial step.  A further check on ‘Scamdadviser.com’, a website that checks the veracity of links, showed that the acclaimed INEC website is being used for scamming schemes. In fact, about 12 different schemes were listed on its home page, including three related to the Atiku Abubakar presidential campaign and one related to the Bola Tinubu presidential campaign, all these schemes requesting people’s details. Ms Iqmot, who registered for the INEC ad-hoc work around October 2022, claimed she was aware of such phishing websites and was careful not to fall prey.  “I registered around October on the INEC PRES portal, and the acknowledgement slip was immediately sent to my email address. I can show you the slip if needed.” A closer look at her acknowledgement slip shows that it was issued from the INEC website. Also, scanning the QR code on the slip returns her details as captured on the slip. When shown the phishing website, Iqmot said: “This is definitely fake; you must first create an account before registering on the INEC PRES website. Moreover, I learnt the registration closed around the middle of December.” While Iqmot’s acknowledgement slip has her passport photograph, the phishing website does not require the applicant’s picture. DUBAWA also finds that the provided link, whose real identity has been deliberately hidden with a customised Uniform Resource Locator (URL), has a customised link that is being shared on WhatsApp to lure victims. This is what appears on WhatsApp:  https://lyupz.com/2023-Inec-Staff –Recruitment/    But the real identity of the website link was later found to be: DUBAWA also finds that https://yournewclaims.com/ is a phishing website designed maliciously to steal the data of unsuspecting public members.  The registration homepage was carefully designed to deceive unsuspecting applicants, with an INEC logo and a replica of the design on authentic INEC PRES. Nigerians are implored to note that INEC staff recruitment has closed since December 14, 2022. This acclaimed website is a phishing scam link designed to defraud unsuspecting members of the public.

"Claim: To locate your polling unit, send your PVC 9-digit code to 8014.","Claim: To locate your polling unit, send your PVC 9-digit code to 8014. Verdict: FALSE. Our findings and comments from INEC show this code is not related to INEC or locating your PU.  The collection of Permanent Voters Cards (PVC) is ongoing as Nigerians gear up to select new leaders to come on February 25, 2023.  In view of this, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) created additional collection centres to fast-track the process.  Amid the collection, which is expected to run till January 25, 2023, a viral WhatsApp message stated that sending the nine-digit polling code of your PVC to 8014 will give you the address of your Polling Unit (PU).  The message, aimed at getting people to vote, noted not knowing your polling unit is no excuse.  “I don’t know my polling unit is not an excuse for you not to vote. Simply text the nine digits code of your PVC to 8014, and your polling unit (Booth) address will be sent to you,” the message reads.  In the lead-up to the election, the public is eager to consume information related to their rights to help decision-making, hence the need to ensure the information available is credible.  A Polling Unit (PU) is where a voter can register to vote on election day. To locate your PU, you can use the Polling Unit Locator Tool by typing in your State, Local Government Area (LGA) and ward.  We reached out to the commissioner for information and voter education, Festus Okoye, who said the commission is not the source of the said code as the commission has not released any code.  “We did not release this,” Mr Okoye responded to the enquiry message from our researcher.  The Chief Press Secretary to the INEC Chairman, Rotimi Oyekanmi, responding to our enquiry, shared a tweet by INEC on the procedure for locating your PVC collection centre.  “The Independent National Electoral Commission has further simplified the collection of Permanent Voters’ Cards at the ward level. Registered voters can simply text specific information to any of the two dedicated numbers below to locate their collection points.” The numbers on the flyer are; 0906-283-0860 and 0906-283-0861. Voters are to send the name of their state, LGA and ward to these numbers.  Our researcher followed the instruction contained in the message by sending the nine-digit PU code to 8014, but the response had nothing to do with the polling unit. Subsequently, a text message was received from another number (9001) speaking of a request for mobile service, which attracted a charge of N50. The message allowed the user to reply with the number one to accept or two to reject.  After accepting, a congratulatory message noted that the user’s reply had been received and confirmation would be sent soon.  24-hours later, this “confirmation” is yet to come in. Although we cannot determine what this code requested for mobile service, it is not related to locating your PU or PVC.  Our findings and comments from INEC show this code is neither related to INEC nor locating your PU.

Claim: FIFA will keep Pele’s feet in the museum upon his family’s permission.,"Following the death of soccer icon and Brazilian Legend Edson Arantes do Nascimento, popularly known as Pele, a Twitter handle, kongtainment (@kongtainment), has tweeted that the feet of the revered soccer icon will be placed in a museum by the Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) upon family’s permission. The handle made the post referencing TNT Sports Brazil as the source of the announcement. The post was made less than 24 hours after Pele was announced to have passed away due to multiple organ failure — a reality of advanced-stage colon cancer.  The tweet was viewed by over 3,000 devices on the microblogging social media platform Twitter, quoted twice, retweeted thrice, and liked 25 times.  Before his death, Pele had, in recent years, been on medication for cancer and visited the hospital weeks before his death for treatment. The famous football icon had won three World Cup tournaments (1958, 1962, and 1970) with his home country, Brazil, and ten league titles with Santos, his club team, and the 1977 North American Soccer League championship with New York Cosmos.  The New York Times has been quoted to have associated Pele with profound love and admiration from both poor and rich folks alike before his demise. He passed away at Israelita Albert Einstein in Sao Paulo at age 82. Due to the sensitivity of the matter and the number of views the tweet has garnered, DUBAWA decided to verify the claim. A brief search on FIFA’s official website only revealed a host of tributes poured in honour of the demised soccer icon and Brazilian legend, with no public message in favour of the accuracy of the tweet.  Messages sent to FIFA and TNT Sports Brazil through emails and social media handles were left without correspondence from either organisation.  Again, after several searches on Google, there was no official statement given by the family of the soccer legend in respect of the claim. Attempts to reach his daughter, Kelly Nascimento and manager, Joe Fraga, were abortive.  We also found no news outlet, including TNT Sports Brazil, with a report publicly confirming that Pele’s feet would be delivered to a museum by FIFA as an artefact. Kongtainment’s tweet is false as neither FIFA, Pele’s family, nor media outlets have confirmed the veracity of such notion.

Claim: A viral tweet stating that Digital Satellite Television (DStv) has bought a license to transmit the Saudi Professional League (SPL) after Cristiano Ronaldo joined Al-Nassr.,"Cristiano Ronaldo is a Portuguese professional footballer who scored over 700 goals in club football and over 100 in international football.  Considered influential due to his sterling achievements, Mr Ronaldo recently signed a deal that is said to be worth  £173 million per year with a Saudi Arabian team, “Al-Nassr.” Perceived as a fortune to the club, this signing has since recorded a huge impact. For example, since the footballer was confirmed as Al-Nassr’s new player, the club’s Instagram following has exponentially grown to 9.6 million. Following this occurrence, there have been several statements getting circulated on social media. One of these is a tweet alleging that Digital Satellite Television (DStv) has received a license to show the Saudi Professional League (SPL) due to Ronaldo’s contract with Al-Nassr. Besides this claim, having gathered 123 retweets and 521 likes, it has also sparked a debate among users who believe and those who do not believe this has happened. This is, therefore, the reason for this fact-check. Firstly, DUBAWA visited the verified Facebook and Twitter handle of DStv but could not find any related announcements. While the television’s earliest Facebook post was based on the Premier League, the Twitter page was about the passing of Peter Squire. Following this, we discovered (from a keyword search) that Multichoice, the mother company that operates DStv recently, launched a “pop-up channel” channel for the festive season. According to the Guardian newspaper, the station only broadcasts from December 15, 2022, till January 3, 2023. Furthermore, we reached out to DStv customer service via its verified Twitter account. The television stated clearly that it had not acquired the rights to transmit the league.  The response read:  “@SundayAwosoro Hi, thank you for contacting us. Please note that we do not have broadcasting rights for the League. ~JSL.” Consequently, these rumours can be flagged as false as DStv does not have broadcasting rights to broadcast the Saudi Professional League.

Claim: People with the AA genotype are prone to sickness during harmattan.,"If you are an avid social media user in Nigeria, you may have seen a few posts about people with the AA genotype falling ill during harmattan. First, let’s take a quick 15 seconds biology class to explain a genotype. A genotype is an individual’s collection of inherited genes from parents, which is mainly divided into four categories. They are AA, AS, SS, and AC. The narrative circulating on social media claims those with the AA genotype fall ill during the harmattan season, a season in West Africa between November and March characterised by dryness, dusty winds, and cold weather. According to the social media posts, some symptoms exhibited by persons who came down with the purported “AA sickness” include fever, sore throat, catarrh, headache, and body pains. These are some of the symptoms associated with COVID-19. The notion has been widely shared on social media, with many confidently attributing their sicknesses during the season to their AA genotype. Oke Umurhohwo, a Twitter user, said, “There is a flu-like sickness spreading currently. Symptoms include Headache, Catarrh, Cold and slight Fever. We really need to be careful. “Funny thing is that it affects mostly AA people. Malaria drugs can cure it, so I am sure it’s not COVID.” Another Twitter user said, “Omo, I used to think being AA was a good thing… Which one come be sickness subscription like this🤮🤒🥶.” “Dear AA, how is Cold and Malaria treating you?” another user asked. Some Facebook users also spoke about the supposed AA sickness. Bamidele Azeez wrote on a Facebook page about his experience with the “AA sickness”. “AA genotype is Overrated,” he said. “Right now, I’m suffering from cold, catarrh, fever, malaria and other orishi rishi symptoms since harmattan started. “They made us understand that we have the strongest blood, so strong that it can combat any form of sickness. But it seems we’ve been scammed.” Azeez’s post has generated over 155 reactions and 43 comments. Some of the commenters agreed with his claim. Another Facebook user wrote, “This sudden sickness affects only people with AA.” The post garnered over 60 reactions and 29 comments, with users claiming they contracted the “sickness”. Studies have shown that those with the AA genotype are more susceptible to malaria. One study involving 372 children at the University of Uyo Teaching Hospital found that “children with genotype AA (92.3%) were more susceptible to malaria parasite than AS (5.1%) and SS (2.6%).” The study said the association of haemoglobin genotype with malaria was highly significant but is there an AA sickness that comes with the harmattan? Bankole Olusegun, a family medicine practitioner, told TheCable that there is nothing like an AA sickness during the season. He described the viral claim on social media as “misconception and misinformation”. “The S gene is an evolutionary process that prevents people from contracting malaria. They do, but not all the time. People with the AA genotype are more prone to malaria than those with AS. But the fact that AA people are more prone to malaria does not mean there’s an AA sickness,” he said. “It’s not only people with the AA genotype that have fallen sick. I have people with the AS genotype that have come down with cold, catarrh, and cough. It’s the dry season and cold season. There are a lot of flu viruses around. “We also have the COVID-19 pandemic. Very few people go for a COVID test. It may be the COVID-19 manifesting, and it may just be the regular flu we see around the harmattan period.” An epidemiologist at Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH), Bayo Onajole, said what is most common are symptoms associated with the dryness that occurs in the harmattan season. He explained that there is no linkage between the flu-like symptoms experienced during the harmattan season and the genotype.  “I’m unaware of any research about the AA genotype being more predisposed to illness. The only research that has been done is that of malaria because the AA genotype is more predisposed to malaria,” Onajole said. “These symptoms are non-specific. Unless you conduct a COVID-19 test, you can’t actually say that they’re just common flu. It may be a result of COVID-19. “But because most of these symptoms are mild, many people will not bother to do a COVID-19 test.” He advised Nigerians to maintain the hygienic procedure of washing hands and using face masks, saying those who come down with the “AA sickness” symptoms should seek medical help. No scientific evidence supports the claim of an “AA sickness” during harmattan.

"Claim: Former Anambra Governor Peter Obi increased Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) from N7 billion to N8 billion within eight years, while Nasir El-Rufai increased Kaduna State IGR from N15 billion to N93 billion.","With increasing interest in the outcome of the 2023 presidential elections, many Nigerians have taken to social media to express their support for their preferred candidates. Some supporters go to extreme lengths to support their candidates, including verbally attacking and criticising members or candidates of perceived opposition parties. A few others also have the penchant for bandying figures that are either untrue or misleading about the presidential candidates – just to prove why their preferred candidates should be voted for. Peter Obi, the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), made the headlines recently over a figure attributed to his time as governor of Anambra State. Mr Obi became the governor of Anambra State on the ticket of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) on March 17, 2006, but was impeached on November 2, 2006, seven months after he was sworn into office.  However, Obi took the matter to court, won the case and was reinstated on February 9, 2007, by the Court of Appeal sitting in Enugu. Months later, another election took place in April 2007 that brought in Andy Uba. Still, his tenure lasted only 16 days before the Supreme Court ordered Uba to vacate the position to allow Mr Obi to complete his tenure. Mr Obi again contested for the governorship position and won a second term in office, which ended on March 7, 2014. After he left office, he maintained a relatively low profile in the political landscape until 2019, when he contested for the position of vice president alongside Atiku Abubakar, presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).  In March 2022, Mr Obi declared his interest in the 2023 presidency, albeit under the PDP. However, his ambition of being the PDP flag bearer was dashed in May when Mr Abubakar emerged as the party’s presidential candidate.  Mr Obi later joined the Labour Party and became the party’s presidential candidate.  Following his emergence as the LP presidential candidate, Mr Obi has become a third major contender in the presidential race after Atiku Abubakar of the PDP and Bola Tinubu of the All Progressives Congress (APC).  This has attracted major conversations around Mr Obi and his achievements during his tenure as governor of Anambra State for eight years.  Just recently, a Twitter user claimed Mr Obi increased the Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) of Anambra State from N7 billion to N8 billion within eight years (an increase of only N1 billion).  The recent tweet continued to generate intense conversations around Mr Obi’s competency and competitive edge against Mr Tinubu, who was said to have significantly improved Lagos State’s economy when he was governor.  Several other accounts on Twitter had also reposted the claim contributing to its virality, as can be found here, here and here.  According to Leo Ukpong, a professor of Financial Economics at American University School of Business, Yola, Adamawa State, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the primary index of economic growth and not the IGR.  Mr Ukpong, a dean at the institution, told DUBAWA that the IGR is derived from taxation, and the higher the taxes, the more it reduces people’s purchasing power.  “IGR is internally generated Revenue; it’s nothing but a tax. You can overtax somebody, a city or a country, but this doesn’t mean you’re growing. In fact, you can be killing the country by over-taxing it. The real indicator of economic growth is the Gross Domestic Product (GDP),” he said.  “For instance, let’s say there are two people in the two States, and they earn N1,000 each; their generated income is N1,000. Now the person in Kaduna could be paying a tax of 60%, which means out of N1,000, about N600 will go into tax while the other person in the other state might be paying 20%. If you look at it, it would seem like Kaduna, with the 60% IGR rate, is growing faster, so definitely, IGR is not an indicator of growth. “In fact, sometimes the higher the IGR, the lower the growth of the economy. It is a fact they are overtaxed. Tax is taking away income from your Gross Income. If I overtax you, you don’t have money to circulate to other activities.  “For instance, if you earn N100,000 monthly at your job and pay a tax rate of about 40%, that means you come home with N60,000. You don’t have money to buy other things. The lower the tax, the higher the expenditure, also known as disposable income. Most countries sometimes lower the tax so that there can be more expenditure on other things in the economy.  “If you only make 60% of your income, you have to ration what you spend the money on; essentials will be your number one expenditure, things like vacation, furniture, DSTV, you might cut down on those, and if you do that, you will decrease the growth rate of the economy.” Claim 1: Peter Obi increased Anambra’s Internally Generated Revenue by only N1 billion within eight years of governance.  Verdict: True As stated in the report of the Accountant General of Anambra State with Financial Statements for the year 2006 signed by the State Accountant General at the time, Ms V. A. Obinwa, the IGR for Anambra State at the end of 2006 was N4.6 billion, a decline from N7.3 billion accrued in 2005.  In 2007, the Financial Statements released by the Accountant General of the State, Barrister R.H.C Ogbogu, showed that the state’s IGR was N6.02 billion, while the IGR in 2008 was N6.06 billion. In 2009, the IGR was N6.5 billion. Data from the National Bureau of Statistics on Internally Generated Revenue at the State level from 2010 to 2012 showed that Anambra State IGR in 2010 was N7.7 billion. In 2011, the IGR of the State was reduced to N6.1 billion. Meanwhile, another data released jointly by the NBS and the Joint Tax Board showed that the Anambra State IGR in 2012 was N7.6 billion and N8.7 billion as of 2013, a year to the end of Mr Obi’s tenure. By 2014, the Anambra State IGR had increased to N10.4 billion, according to data from the NBS. However, DUBAWA observed that the Accountant General’s report indicating IGR in Anambra State does not include the Value Added Tax accrued for the year. Mr Ukpong told DUBAWA that VAT is a subset of the IGR and is usually calculated alongside other components of the IGR. Therefore, DUBAWA deemed it fit to include the VAT data on the Accountant General’s report for Anambra from 2006 to 2009. In 2006, the VAT was N2.7 billion, which increased to N3.5 billion in 2007. The State recorded N4.67 billion in 2008 and N4.6 billion in 2009.  The claim that the Anambra State IGR moved from N7 billion to N8 billion within eight years is true. Available data shows that there was a decline in the IGR from N7 billion to N4 billion between 2005 and 2006, the year Mr Obi became governor. However, there was a slow increase in the IGR to N8.7 billion in 2013, a few months before the end of Mr Obi’s tenure. Claim 2: El-Rufai increased Kaduna State IGR from N15 billion to N93 billion.  Verdict: False Nasir El-Rufai, Governor of Kaduna State, was sworn into office in April 2015 and was re-elected in 2019 to complete his second tenure by 2023. Mr El-Rufai served as Minister of the Federal Capital Territory from 2003 to 2007; he was also the director of the Bureau of Public Enterprises. Mr El-Rufai, a foremost member of the APC, has declared his support for the party’s flagbearer, Mr Tinubu, a major contender against Mr Obi. Some Twitter users have claimed that Mr El-Rufai adopted a model purportedly created by the APC presidential candidate to increase the IGR of Kaduna State. Mr Tinubu served as Lagos State Governor from 1999 to 2007. DUBAWA’s findings revealed that Lagos State IGR as of 1999 was N14.6 billion, and as of the end of Mr Tinubu’s tenure in 2007, the IGR had increased significantly to N83.02 billion. However, there were pockets of decline within the eight years.  Supporters of Mr Tinubu, who identified as ‘BATists’, an acronym of the three names of the presidential candidate, had on a few occasions bandied figures claiming Lagos IGR in 1999 was N600 million and had experienced rapid growth to its current rate of N753.4 billion due to the Tinubu effect, even though he had stopped ruling since 2007. Using available data from the NBS, the Internally Generated Revenue of Kaduna State as of the end of 2015 is N11.5 billion, representing a 9.75% decline from the N12.7 billion the previous year.  The following year 2016, Kaduna State generated N23 billion IGR or N17.05 billion, a significant increase from the previous year.  There are conflicting figures around Kaduna State’s IGR in the year 2016. In one report, the Kaduna State Internal Revenue Service claimed the state’s IGR for 2016 was N23.5 billion. In another report, the same body claimed Kaduna State generated N17.5 billion internally.  In 2017, Kaduna State IGR was N26.5 billion, a 15.23% increase from the previous year. In 2018, the State generated N29.4 billion from PAYE, Direct Assessment, road taxes, and other taxes. NBS recorded N44.9 billion as IGR for Kaduna in 2019. For the full year of 2020, Kaduna state’s IGR was pegged at N50.7 billion and in 2021, the state recorded N52.8 billion IGR. There is no data yet regarding Kaduna State’s IGR as of the end of 2022.  The claim that El-Rufai raised Kaduna State IGR from N15 billion to N93 billion is false. Available data shows the State IGR in 2021 was N52.8 billion.

"Claim: A Twitter user states that Prof Babagana Zulum, the governor of Borno State, bought voters’ cards of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) ahead of the 2023 elections.","Borno, a state in the northeastern parts of Nigeria, has been ravaged by conflict between terrorists and government forces since 2009. As a result, millions have been rendered homeless and forced to find shelter at Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) camps spread within and outside the state.  In 2019, Professor Babagana Zulum was voted as the governor of Borno State under the All Progressives Congress (APC), a political party that took over power in 2015 with the mandate to restore order and peace in the regions and across Nigeria. He is now seeking a second term in office in 2023. Recently, a video surfaced on Twitter alleging that the governor is buying off the voter cards of IDPs in their camps. The video featured a man wearing a caftan with a cap that bears the inscription “ZULUM 2023” alongside another person in a security outfit distributing what appears to be naira notes to an assemblage of people seated row after row.   One user, Evars Hair (@EOguguah), who tweeted the video, alleged that it depicted an exchange of voter’s card for money in an IDP camp ahead of the 2023 elections.  “Because they’re all manipulating!!! Exchange of voter’s card for money in an IDP CAMP by ZULUM (the governor of Borno State) 2023 representatives,” the user wrote.  Dr Ope Banwo, a popular Nigerian celebrity known as “Ali Baba,” seems to agree with the claim. He tweeted the video expressing shock with rhetorical questions while calling on President Muhammadu Buhari and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to take action over the alleged situation. His post attracted over 300,000 reactions with over 60,000 views and diverse comments.  “Seriously? Somebody, please tell me it’s not Voters Card they are selling for N500 like this in the north? With full chest? In public? Where is INEC? Where is Buhari? What,” Ali baba tweeted alongside the alleged video.  Apparently, this is not the first time the video has gone viral. In early December 2022, the video was shared on Nairaland, an interactive information-sharing website with over four million active users.  Back in July 2022, the video was also shared on Twitter with the same narrative, amassing a plethora of reactions and views from online users.  Vote buying is one of the major problems affecting the quality of elections in Nigeria. In previous elections, several allegations of voter card purchases by political parties have been made. As such, the general outlook around this assertion signals a lack of trust by Nigerian voters in the electoral process, a problem that, if allowed, could crumble the quality of the 2023 elections.  To ascertain the tweet’s veracity, DUBAWA first tried to track the earliest appearance of the alleged video online. Using keyframes extracted by the InVid video verification tool, the earliest version of the video was traced to a TikTok account with the user @honhabu. It was posted on July 27, 2022, with no caption or narration.  The TikTok account also contains several pictures and videos of the same man seen in the alleged video sharing money. DUBAWA found that the man is Habu Daja, a serving member of the Borno State House of Assembly, representing Damboa Constituency.  When DUBAWA reached out to Mr Daja via a phone call regarding the video, his aide, Mohammed Baba, said that the video was taken during a visit to the IDP camp in Damboa, where the Governor shared money and other necessities to IDPs and flood victims.   “No, this is not even recent. The video was taken during the Governor’s visit to Damboa on July 25, 2022. His Excellency and honourable (Daja) shared money and other materials with the people.”  As regards the acclaimed voter’s card, Mr Baba said they were not voters’ cards but special vouchers given to IDPs and the flood victims to facilitate equitable sharing.  “It is not a voter’s card.  They are special vouchers given to IDPs and victims across the state to aid proper sharing and prevent double rationing, which was common before the card system was introduced,” he said.   On the official Facebook page of the “Governor of Borno State,” a press statement was released on July 25, 2022, that details a visit by the Governor to meet with IDPs and flood victims in the Damboa local government area of Borno State.  The report, “Flood: Zulum in Damboa, shares N172m, food to 30,436 residents,” described how the governor and his entourage shared money and materials with IDPs and flood victims in Damboa on the same date as the one stated by Mr Baba.  Pictures shared alongside the press statement appear to align with the alleged video. A man standing behind the governor in an image shared alongside the press statement is also identified in the alleged video; see figure 2.  Figure 1: An image shared with the statement on the official Facebook of the Governor captured a man standing behind Governor Zulum. In figure 2, taken from the alleged video, the same man is also distributing money in the background.   Both figures 1 and 2 show that the alleged video was actually taken during the governor’s visit to Damboa on July 25, 2022, and not fraudulent voter card-buying sessions ahead of the 2023 elections. DUBAWA also unearthed another video on Facebook about Governor Zulum’s visit to Damboa. It featured the man in caftan in the alleged video sharing money. Figure 3 below shows the man in the alleged video in this separate video about the governor’s visit to Damboa.  In another video, an IDP woman is seen holding some money and a voucher card. Job Kaltho, a humanitarian officer working with Mercy Corps, described the voucher as humanitarian cards with special security features normally shared with IDPs’ who have been identified as eligible for food and cash tokens. Mr Kaltho said, “The cards were introduced three years ago to identify fake IDPs who usually penetrate camps and take food and cash meant for genuine IDPs. “As such, the cards also guard against double rations collected by some IDPs who sell out food to exploitative marketers that highly underpay the IDPs.” He laughed at the possibility of cards being voter cards and explained that most humanitarian workers in Borno know about the cards. “It made sharing things to a large and decorated crowd possible,” Kaltho says.  In one of the pictures shared alongside the Governor’s statement on his official  Facebook page, a crowd of women was seen waving the cards.    Additionally, several news reports by credible news organisations like TVC reported Governor Zulum’s visit to Damboa on July 25, 2022, using the same pictures as the one on the Press statement shared on the official Facebook page of the governor. There is no report by any credible media supporting the conduct in the alleged video. The claim is false, and the scene in the video was simply a distribution of money and vital goods to IDPs and victims of flood in the Damboa Local Government area of Borno state.

"The presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Peter Obi, recently released a 72-page Manifesto titled “It’s POssible: Our Pact with Nigerians.” This manifesto, according to Mr Obi, lays out their mission focus and mandate for securing, uniting, and making Nigeria productive.","The presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Peter Obi, recently released a 72-page Manifesto titled “It’s POssible: Our Pact with Nigerians.” This manifesto, according to Mr Obi, lays out their mission focus and mandate for securing, uniting, and making Nigeria productive. Giving a background to the issues in Nigeria and what needs to be done, Mr Obi, in his manifesto, said 63% of Nigerians, representing 133 million people, are poor with no access to basic sanitation.  The need to hold public office holders and seekers accountable prompted DUBAWA to verify this claim.  Claim 1: 63% of Nigerians are poor. Verdict 1: TRUE A keyword search on this figure led to a report by Vanguard with the exact statistics quoting the National Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) Survey results for 2022.  A look at the MPI based on four dimensions: health, education, living standards, and work, reveals that 63% of people in Nigeria (133 million) are multidimensionally poor. This index shows that poor people in Nigeria experience just over one-quarter of all possible deprivations.  Claim 2: 63% of Nigerians have no access to basic sanitation. Verdict 2: MISLEADING The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention defines basic sanitation as having access to facilities for the safe disposal of human waste (faeces and urine), as well as having the ability to maintain hygienic conditions through services such as garbage collection, industrial/hazardous waste management, and wastewater treatment and disposal. The MPI survey shows 46.5% are deprived in the area of sanitation.  “Over half of the population who are multidimensionally poor cook with dung, wood or charcoal, rather than clean energy. High deprivations are also apparent in sanitation, time to healthcare, food insecurity, and housing,” part of the survey result reads.  The first claim that 63% of people in Nigeria (133 million) are multidimensionally poor is true, while the claim that this 63% have no access to sanitation is misleading.

Claim: Youths aged between 15 and 35 account for over 65 per cent or around 130 million of Nigeria’s 200 million population.,"Claim: Youths aged between 15 and 35 account for over 65 per cent or around 130 million of Nigeria’s 200 million population.  Verdict: Insufficient evidence. Ahead of the 2023 presidential election, Bola Tinubu, one of the major contenders, has released his manifesto informing Nigerians of his action plan if elected. Tinubu has consistently promised to replicate his achievements as governor of Lagos State at the Federal level with his running mate, Kashim Shettima.  The former Lagos governor also said he would focus on sectors ranging from economy to security and education if elected. He also said his government would mainly focus on the teeming youth population of Nigeria, facing unemployment challenges. Mr Tinubu, in his policy document, said his administration would pay special attention to the youth. The ex-governor also said the youths aged between 15 and 35 account for over 65 per cent or over 130 million of the population in Nigeria.  According to Worldometer, Nigeria has a population of over 200 million people.  In July, the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs released the World Population Prospects 2022. According to the report, the world population could grow to 8.5 billion in 2030. The report also estimated that over the next three decades, Nigeria would likely be the third most populated country, with 375 million people and youths who will account for about 262 million of the population.  “The population in many countries in sub-Saharan Africa is projected to double between 2022 and 2050, putting additional pressure on already strained resources and challenging policies aimed to reduce poverty and inequalities,” the UN said. In an earlier report, the United Nations noted that the African continent has the youngest population in the world, with about 70 per cent of sub-Saharan Africa under 30, adding that this can be an opportunity for the continent’s growth.  However, concerned stakeholders have ignited a discourse on whether the governments of these countries, Nigeria inclusive, are ready to provide the needed infrastructure to harvest the potential of their young population. Just recently, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) stated that over 130 million Nigerians are multidimensionally poor. The rate of unemployment among Nigerian youths has continued to worsen. The latest data from the NBS pegged the country’s unemployment rate at 33.3 per cent in the last quarter of 2020. Statista showed that half of the country’s population is under 19 years, with the highest age bracket being children under four years old (16.3 per cent).  This is closely followed by children aged 5 to 9. The percentage of male children in this age group is 7.4%, while 7.1% are females. The body further noted that Nigeria has one of the youngest populations in the world.  Another recent data from Statista on the age distribution of Nigeria’s population shows children within 0-14 years representing 43.31%, while the highest age group are those between the ages of 15-64 years old, representing 53.9% of the population.   Also, 2021 data from the World Bank showed that people aged 0 to 14 years old form a major part of Nigeria’s population, with 43.3% of the total population, while those aged 15-64 years old make up 53.7% of the population. Those between the ages of 65 and above make up the least part of the population, with 2.98% of the total population.  There is no data specifically for the population between ages 15 to 35 years old. It is unclear where Mr Tinubu got his data on the youth population.  On the phone, efforts to contact Festus Keyamo, the spokesperson of the APC’s Presidential Campaign Council (PCC), proved abortive as his number was unreachable as of the time of filing this report. A text message sent to him was also not replied to. There is insufficient evidence to support the assertion that 130 million Nigerians, or 65% of Nigeria’s 200 million population, represent youths aged 15-35.

"Claim: “Under President George Weah, the inflation rate has gone up,” a TV anchor in Nigeria asserts.","As Liberia’s presidential and legislative elections draw closer, politicians have been campaigning vehemently to win the hearts and minds of citizens.   These election campaigns are fought on issues, particularly corruption, security, cost of living etc. These issues are of great concern to the voters in previous elections as they are to them in the upcoming ones. In an era of a global crisis fueled by the worldwide pandemic, one of the most critical issues of concern to Liberian voters is the cost of living driven by the prices of goods and services. Over the last few days, there has been some controversy over whether or not inflation has gone up under the Weah administration. This debate was triggered by an interview with the immediate past Vice President of Liberia, now the standard bearer of the main opposition Unity Party (UP), Ambassador Joseph Nyumah Boakai, on a local news network in Nigeria, Arise News, during which he promised to rescue Liberia from its current leadership headed by President George Weah. During the interview, one of the hosts, Ayo Mairo-Ese, suggested to Ambassador Boakai that prices of goods (inflation rate) in Liberia have gone up under President George Weah. She, therefore, wanted to find out from the candidate what he would do about the rising cost of goods and services if he were voted into power. In response, Ambassador Boakai affirmed the host’s suggestion and assured viewers of his commitment to deal with inflation if voted into power. The show was held on December 6, 2022, in Nigeria and was carried live on Arise News TV network with 7.5k viewers and hundreds of engagements.  Madam Ayo Mairo-Ese made the claim at 13:40-50 seconds of the over 19 minutes show. Legitimate as the question may be, there has been controversy over whether inflation has gone up under the current administration. This has generated a lot of controversy in the social and traditional media, as seen here, with the author of the latter encouraging President Weah to ensure that his promises to fight inflation, corruption and other economic problems are fulfilled.    DUBAWA, therefore, feels obligated to investigate whether or not inflation has gone up under President George Weah.  To ascertain the claim, it is important to understand what inflation is and to track the inflation rate before and during the tenure of President George Weah. Inflation is defined as a rise in the prices of goods and services across the economy, eroding purchasing power for consumers and businesses. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) also has a similar definition which states: “inflation is the rate of increase in price over some time.”  To ascertain the claim, it is important to understand what inflation is and to track the inflation rate before and during the tenure of President George Weah. Inflation is defined as a rise in the prices of goods and services across the economy, eroding purchasing power for consumers and businesses. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) also has a similar definition “inflation is the rate of increase in price over some time.”  President Weah was voted into power in December 2017. Before his election, Liberia’s inflation rate in 2016 was 8.83%. Data cited by DUBAWA indicate that Liberia’s inflation rate rose to 12.42% in 2017, a 3.59% increase from 2016 and in 2018, 23.56%, a huge 11.14% increase from 2017. Since then, the rate of inflation has been drastically declining. According to the World Bank in Liberia, the September 30, 2022, latest report titled “Liberia’s poverty reduction strategy is supported by the rebuilding of core functions and institutions, rehabilitating infrastructure, and facilitating growth,” under Economic overview, Liberia’s inflation rate is put at 6.5% as of July 2022. According to the World Bank report, “despite higher global fuel and food prices, inflation remained contained in 2021 and during the first half of 2022. Annual average inflation declined to 7.9% in 2021, down from 17.4% in 2020 and has moderated further to 6.5% in July 2022.” Also, per the latest report published by Aaron O’Neill on December 2, 2022, under the caption “Inflation Rate in Liberia,” the rate of inflation is 6.9%. Based on the above, it is misleading to suggest that the inflation rate has gone up under the Weah-led administration. Data from reputable sources, including the World Bank, indicate that inflation increased only in the first year of his administration but has since taken a tumble to 6.5% in 2022, lower than the 8.3% it inherited.

Claim: A viral tweet claims the 2019/2020 best graduating student from the department of Geology at the Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU) had second-class lower.,"Claim: A viral tweet claims the 2019/2020 best graduating student from the department of Geology at the Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU) had second-class lower. Verdict: False. Information from the convocation brochure and debunking of the assertion by the University’s Chairman of the Ceremonial Committee show the best graduating student completed his study with a second-class upper. Recently, a Twitter account named ‘@TheGreatestIFE’ made a controversial claim on the convocation ceremony for the 2019/2020 graduating set of Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU). The institution held its 46th convocation ceremony from December 7 to December 10. The Twitter account, which is primarily dedicated to events in the institution, with over 33,000 followers, put out a tweet claiming that the best graduating student from the department of Geology at the institution graduated with a second class lower.  The tweet, which has gone viral, has generated mixed reactions on social media platforms. The reactions are largely due to the perceived toughness of Geology as a course over the years.  Some social media users engaging with the tweet had claimed the purported result showed failure on the part of lecturers at the department. Others also remarked that awarding a second class lower to the best graduating student from a department should not be a feat. A tweep, @tosin_olaluwoye, commented, “I hope you guys realise this is not something to celebrate. Mass failure looks more like an indictment on the lecturers. All the students cannot be dull. Institutions need to stop bragging about the number of students that could not pass.” But how true is the claim in the tweet? Checks on the university convocation brochure for 2019/2020 by DUBAWA showed the prize for the best graduating student in Geology was awarded to ‘Odiamehi Precious Osemudiamen’.  A check on his grade revealed Osemudiamen graduated with a second class (upper division). Further checks showed Osemudiamen received the Oluwafisayo Ekundayo Prize: “For the best graduating student in the Department of Geology whose class of degree is not below Second Class Honours (Upper Division).” Professor Charles Ukeje, the University’s Chairman of the Ceremonial Committee, has also debunked this viral claim on Twitter by quoting the tweet from @TheGreatestIFE. He also provided the names of the five candidates who graduated with a second class (upper division). The claim that OAU’s 2019/2020 best graduating student in Geology had second class lower is false.

Claim: Africa Facts Zone claims Morocco’s triumph over Portugal in the quarter-final of the ongoing FIFA World Cup will give Africa 11 slots at the 2026 edition.,"Claim: Africa Facts Zone claims Morocco’s triumph over Portugal in the quarter-final of the ongoing FIFA World Cup will give Africa 11 slots at the 2026 edition. Verdict: FALSE Following the triumph of the Atlas Lions of Morocco in the third semi-final match at the ongoing 2022 Federation of International Football Association (FIFA) World Cup on Saturday, December 10, 2022, the entire African continent was thrown into a frenzy. It’s the first time an African team would reach the semi-finals in the 92 years history of the quadrennial global sports event. The world cup currently ongoing in Qatar has elicited both online and offline reactions globally. One such reaction trailed the historical feat came from Africa Facts Zone, which dubbed itself “Africa’s biggest facts brand and the world’s most up-to-date facts platform” in its Twitter bio. It’s Twitter handle @AfricaFactsZone has about 853,000 followers. While the match was ongoing at about 4:36 PM (WAT) on Saturday, Africa Facts Zone tweeted, “If Morocco defeats Portugal and qualifies for the semi-finals of the FIFA World Cup, Africa will get 11 slots in the 2026 World Cup. 9 permanent slots, one via playoff and one because they reached the semi-finals.”    As of Sunday morning, the tweet has already garnered 351 comments, 7,102 retweets and over 27,000 likes. This tweet also sparked a reaction from Twitter users. In a reaction, Nuno Sousa (@nnuunneexx), wrote: “@motlaleexcel, this is what I meant! Reach later stages… get more slots… ! Basic maths.” @nnuunneexx obviously believed Africa Facts Zone and even used it to prove his erroneous belief to another user.  Another user, Foz (@FozGharby), was curious when he asked, “Is that true? That spots at the next WC linked to performance this WC (sic)?” Morocco went on to make history as the first African country to reach the FIFA World Cup Semi-final after Youssef En-Nesyri’s first half-header helped the Atlas Lions defeat their Portuguese opponents. Does this victory mean the Confederation of African Football (CAF) would get 11 slots at the 2026 FIFA World Cup? Since the number of participating teams at the world cup increased at the 1998 FIFA World Cup in France, five countries have continued to represent Africa at the competition. However, FIFA, at a meeting held on January 9 and 10, 2017, at the FIFA headquarters in Zurich, Switzerland, expanded the competition to allow the participation of 48 teams/countries from the current 32 teams competing for the 18-karat gold trophy.  The 48-team version of the competition is set to debut at the 2026 edition of the FIFA World Cup, which Canada, Mexico would host, and the United States after their joint bid defeated Morocco’s bid during the voting for host selection which took place during the 68th FIFA congress on June 13, 2018. On Thursday, March 30, 2017, FIFA President Gianni Infantino and the presidents of the six football confederations met and agreed on slot allocation for the new 48-team format. The FIFA Council ratified the slot allocation at its meeting on May 9, 2017, in Bahrain. CAF was allocated nine direct slots, Asian Football Confederation (AFC) got eight direct slots, the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) got 16 direct slots, Oceania Football Association (OFA) got one direct slot, and the South American Football Confederation (CONMEBOL), the Confederation of North, Central, American and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF) got six direct slots each.  This gives room for an intercontinental playoff for the remaining two slots. The playoff would involve a team from each of the confederations except UEFA and one additional team from the confederation of the host country. From the above allocation, Africa has nine sure slots, while one more African country will head to an intercontinental playoff involving five other countries worldwide. Two countries in the playoff will qualify for the 2026 World Cup.  So far, FIFA has not mentioned anywhere that a semi-final spot would increase the slot of a country’s confederation at the next edition. The claim by Africa Facts Zone is wrong. Africa won’t get 11 slots at the 2026 FIFA World Cup because Morocco qualified for the semi-final of the 2022 edition. Africa will get nine direct slots and have the chance of having one more country in the competition through a playoff.

"On November 26, Gboyega Oyetola of the All Progressives Congress (APC) bade the people of Osun State farewell after four years in office as governor. He became the governor of the state on November 27, 2018.","On November 26, Gboyega Oyetola of the All Progressives Congress (APC) bade the people of Osun State farewell after four years in office as governor. He became the governor of the state on November 27, 2018. The development had come after he lost his re-election bid to Ademola Adeleke of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) during the gubernatorial election held on July 16, 2022.  The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) had announced that Mr Adeleke, candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), won the election after he polled 403,371 votes.  Mr Oyetola’s farewell speech came hours before the swearing-in ceremony of Mr Adeleke, his successor. In the speech, Mr Oyetola made several claims ranging from the achievements of his administration to the alleged failures of Rauf Aregbesola, his predecessor. DUBAWA examined some of the claims.  Claim 1: The former governor claimed his administration fixed the state specialist hospital in Osogbo and equipped it with state-of-the-art equipment, with the construction of a 120-bed ward. DUBAWA did a keyword search on Google to verify the former governor’s claims on the revitalisation of the health sector in Osun State.  First is fixing the state specialist hospital in Osogbo, which he claimed was equipped with state-of-the-art equipment and construction of a 120-bed ward. According to news reports online, former governor Oyetola approved the project in 2019.  Data obtained from the Osun Public Procurement Agency showed that a total of N6.1 billion was budgeted for the project, and the sum of N258,882,608 was released for constructing a 120-bed ward at Asubiaro Specialist Hospital. The project was awarded to Werkmelster Facility Manager Limited, and work commenced on the site in August 2019.  It was observed that the project was still ongoing as of the time the document was released. A visit to the site by a DUBAWA researcher on Monday, December 12, shows that the project has been completed. However, it has not been commissioned or opened for use. Verdict: True. The project has been completed. Claim 2: The former Osun governor also claimed his administration built 30 units of Doctor’s Quarters at Asubiaro Specialist Hospital, Osogbo. From the data on the Osun State Public Procurement Portal in 2019, the sum of N130,603,235 was released to construct Doctor’s Quarters at the hospital. The contract was awarded to Dotfam Multiventures Limited.  A report by Campus Reporter facilitated by Udeme showed that the construction of the doctor’s quarters had been completed as of April 2022. However, the building had yet to be accommodated as of the time the report was published.  Verdict: True, the project had been completed though not yet occupied by tenants. Claim 3: Mr Oyetola claimed that his government revitalized 332 primary health centres in the state.  This is not the first time Mr Oyetola would make this claim. During the third anniversary of his government in 2021, he claimed his government had revitalised over 300 of the 332 Primary Health Centres (PHCs) spread across the state, adding that the remaining 32 were near completion.  In 2019, he promised to awaken the health sector in Osun State, one of which is the revitalisation, renovation, rehabilitation and upgrading of the 332 Primary Health Care centres in all the wards in the state.  Tracka had, in March 2019, published the list of the 332 PHCs. Earlier in the year, Osun State was awarded $20 million (N7.3 billion) under the Saving One Million Lives Programme for Result (SOML-PforR). SOML- PforR is a flagship of the federal government conceived in 2012 but repackaged in 2015 following a $500 million credit from the World Bank to finance healthcare. In 2020, Dr Rafiu Isamotu, the Commissioner for Health at the time, announced that the State had obtained $20.5million from the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the amount, according to her, was to be expended on the revitalisation and the development of the listed centres. Meanwhile, an investigative report by HumAngle in December 2021 showed that some of the 300 health centres commissioned by the government were in ruins. The report also revealed how the health centres were barely equipped with the needed facilities as some were just repainted.  Members of the community who were interviewed said they were not impressed with the government and raised and dashed their hopes. Another report done by Radio Nigeria in December 2021 corroborated the claim that some of the healthcare centres were in shambles. Verdict: Insufficient evidence Claim 4: Osun IGR has grown from N10 billion to N20 billion — Oyetola “From a little above N10 billion in 2018, we have been able to grow the State IGR to N20 billion, just as our performance in the World Bank’s States’ Fiscal Transparency, Accountability, and Sustainability (SFTAS) has continued to earn us accolades and financial benefits,” the former governor said. He added, “In 2018, before we came into office, Osun was placed 32nd on the fiscal sustainability index, finishing just ahead of Taraba, Plateau, Adamawa, and Kogi states. “However, by the latest ranking in 2021, we have climbed to the 19th place on the index, as we are now ranked 13th out of 36 states of the federation.” DUBAWA verified the figures given with data from the National Bureau of Statistics. The NBS data showed that the state’s IGR in 2018 was pegged at N10,381,663,677 with N2,118,883,555 in the first quarter of 2018, N2,655,049,761 in the second quarter of the year, N2,738,102,673 in the third quarter and N2,869,627,687 in the last quarter of the year.  Also, NBS data for Internally Generated Revenue at the state level from 2019 to 2021 published recently showed that Osun State’s IGR for the year 2021 was N21,855,392,562 with N12,839,424,275 obtained from tax revenues and N9,015,968,287 from other sources. Verdict: True. The State’s IGR increased significantly between 2018 and 2021. Claim 5: Mr Oyetola claimed he was awarded Best Governor on Efficiency of Public Expenditure and TOP Performer on Domestic Revenue Mobilisation by the World Bank’s States’ Fiscal Transparency, Accountability and Sustainability, SFTAS, recently. The States’ Fiscal Transparency, Accountability and Sustainability, SFTAS, program for results 2018 to 2022 released recently in November 2022 showed that Osun State truly got recognition for Domestic Revenue Mobilisation. Yobe State was recognised as the overall top performer in all DLRs for the entire period and for Fiscal Transparency and Accountability; Borno was recognised for having the greatest improvement in performance from 2018 to 2019 and 2020 to 2021; Jigawa was recognised for Debt Sustainability while Edo was recognised for being efficient in Public Expenditures.  Also, a report by Leadership recently showed that Oyetola was recognised as Best Governor on Efficiency of Public Expenditure by the World Bank. Oyetola was said to have bagged the award following reforms which he deployed and which have impacted positively on the fiscal transparency and accountability in public resource management of the state.

"Claim: Reno Omokri, a staunch PDP member, joined Tinubu’s supporters in London.","Bola Tinubu, former governor of Lagos State who is also the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), reportedly visited London, United Kingdom, recently.  According to a statement by Bayo Onanuga, Director, Media and Publicity of the APC Presidential Campaign Council, Mr Tinubu was scheduled to speak at Chatham House on Monday, December 5, 2022, on issues bordering on security, economy, and foreign policy. Mr Tinubu, one of the leading contenders in the forthcoming presidential election, has been accused of refusing to speak to local media about his ambition. Meanwhile, on Monday, December 5, while the presidential candidate was in London, there was reportedly a rally organised by Tinubu’s supporters in front of Chatham House. At the same time, Reno Omokri, a Special Assistant to former President Goodluck Jonathan who is also a staunch supporter of Atiku Abubakar, presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), led a protest at the same venue to discredit the reputation of the APC presidential candidate. Mr Omokri, who posted several videos on his Facebook page, was seen leading a group of persons in the #HarassTinubuOutofLondon protest. He was seen holding a placard that reads, “No to a drug baron in Aso Rock.” Likewise, the other protesters carried placards bearing different inscriptions. One of them reads, “Nigerians reject Bola Escobar and his heroin cartel.” They were also heard chanting “Tinubu Ole” (a Yoruba word for thief). The video can be seen here and here. However, a Nigerian newspaper, The Nation, posted one of the videos captured at the scene of the event with the headline, “Former presidential aide Reno Omokri joins Tinubu’s supporters in London.” The video posted on the website and social media handles of the media platform showed Mr Omokri among Mr Tinubu’s supporters, and the crowd was heard chanting, “Tinubu for President.” The media house also used the picture of Mr Omokri standing in front of Mr Tinubu’s supporters, who were carrying placards on which inscriptions showing their loyalty to the presidential candidate was written.  The video was also shared on Twitter by one @RealAdeshina, a member of the APC, with the caption, “Shock of the century as Reno Omokri declares his support for Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu as Next President… Guysss RT!  🎥 @RealAdeshina.” DUBAWA searched the social media handles of the former presidential aide and saw several posts on the #HarassTinubuoutofLondon protest. Mr Omokri, as of Tuesday, posted his daily series on why people should vote for Atiku Abubakar as the next president of Nigeria.  Also, a closer look at the videos shared by The Nation and another shared by Reno Omokri on his social media handle showed that both the #HarassTinubuOutofLondon protesters and Tinubu’s supporters were at the same spot, hence the perceived clash between the two groups. While Reno and his team were chanting “Tinubu!” followed by some abusive words, the other team screamed “for President!” followed by a loyalty song. This does not depict Omokri ‘joining’ Tinubu’s supporters. The headline depicting that Omokri ‘joined” Tinubu’s supporters in London is misleading.

"Claim: An image shows the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu met the US president, Joe Biden.","An image of Bola Tinubu, the presidential candidate for Nigeria’s governing All Progressives Congress (APC), sitting with US president Joe Biden has gone viral on Twitter and Facebook.  A tweet with the image claims it was a picture of Tinubu meeting Biden on November 29, 2022.  “Happening now: @officialABAT on a courtesy visit to US President Joe Biden as part of his US on international engagements. Obidiots say Tinubu cannot visit the US based on his indictment. He is there right now, live with the US President. Let your Obi visit too. Mumu pipo,” the tweet reads.  “Obidiots” is an insulting name given to supporters of Peter Obi, the Labour Party’s presidential candidate. “Mumu pipo” is pidgin for “stupid people.” Nigeria is set to hold general elections, including for the president, in early 2023. Tinubu and Obi are among the leading candidates for the top job. The image has also appeared on Facebook here, here, here, here, and here. Tinubu’s candidacy has stirred many controversies, including his alleged involvement in a drug trafficking and money laundering case in the US back in 1993, but his campaign has denied this. But did Tinubu meet Biden in the White House? In verifying the viral image, we saw some telltale signs that it had been doctored. There are significant variations in picture quality, with the part around Tinubu and the man sitting next to him looking blurry. Objects behind Tinubu have their edges rough and overlapping in an unnatural way.    This is a red flag because photos of visits to the White House, the official residence of US presidents in Washington DC, are always of good quality. Professional photographers are used for all official engagements.    A reverse image search led to several media reports that indicated the original photo came from July 26 2021, a meeting between Iraqi prime minister Mustafa Al-Kadhimi and Biden in the president’s White House oval office.  The APC’s presidential campaign council has debunked the claim that Tinubu met with Biden.  A statement by Bayo Onanuga, the council’s director of media and publicity, blamed opposition parties for the misinformation. At the time the image was supposedly snapped, he said, Tinubu was in Abuja, Nigeria’s capital.  “A viral photograph showing Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu and United State President, Joe Biden, in talks at the White House is the latest in the series of misinformation being dished out by the political opposition,” the statement reads.  “We cannot just fathom the purpose of the mischief and the falsehood which emanated from the rabid followers of Peter Obi. The apparently photo-shopped image surfaced Tuesday night, on the heels of news that Asiwaju Tinubu will embark on a foreign trip this weekend.”  Findings show that the presidential candidate of the APC, Bola Tinubu, did not meet with US president Joe Biden in the White House in late November 2022. The image being shared with this narrative is doctored. This report was written by Africa Check and republished by DUBAWA as part of the Nigerian Fact-checkers’ Coalition initiative.

Claim: A broadcast message has been circulating on WhatsApp platforms claiming that Nigerians can vote without their Permanent Voter’s Card provided they have registered with the Independent Electoral Commission (INEC).,"A broadcast message has been circulating on WhatsApp platforms with a claim that‏ Nigerians can vote without their permanent voter card provided they had registered with the INEC. The viral message reads, “Contrary to speculation that without your Permanent Voters Card, PVC, you cannot vote in the election, INEC said provided your name is in their register you can vote on election day. If you had registered with INEC but could not collect your PVC before election day. “What you just need to do is, on election day, go to your polling unit where you registered and check for your name in the register on display before the election day. If you appear, then meet the polling unit officer with VIN in the register. With the help of the BVAS, you can vote on election day. “Now, this is how the BVAS works. There will be no thumb printing for other people this time around. Once you can give your VIN to the electoral officers, he or she will allow you to place your thumb on the BVAS machine. This means your temporary voter card is still valid. Keep it. “Once you place your thumb on the BVAS machine, it will first display your BioData (picture, birthday, and other information about you). And thereafter, the BVAS machine will display all the political parties’ Logos, and you will then thumbprint the party you wish to vote for. The BVAS machine will transmit your voting results to the relevant collation center. “No one else can use your PVC on election day, and there will be no card reader in use on election day. However, go and collect your PVC to make your voting process easy. “Many of the PVCs are not readily available for collection. Those who registered or made a correction or transfer early this year PVCs are not in the INEC office. Many of them were asked to come to collect their PVC in the second week of December 2022. “This shouldn’t be a reason to panic, for you will eventually vote if you have registered with INEC. Your name and passport will be on display at the polling unit where you registered. “This information is very helpful, useful, and vital, so those who may have misplaced their PVC should not panic. They can still exercise their franchise.” Findings by FactCheck Elections revealed that the INEC had, in 2021, kicked against the Federal Government’s proposed use of the National Identification Number (NIN) as a requirement for voter registration in Nigeria. The Commission noted that the move is not backed by law, and it does not share its powers to register voters with any other government agency. Meanwhile, the INEC Chairman, Mahmood Yakubu, debunked and described the broadcast message as misleading in a live video. Yakubu noted that for any person to vote, he/she must be registered and issued a Permanent Voters Card. He urged Nigerians to disregard the news, saying it is fake and misleading. “The misleading statement that voters can vote on the day of the election without a voter’s card. It has been trending since last week. This is absolutely incorrect. For any person to vote, he or she must be a registered voter issued with the PVC. “I hereby urge Nigerians to ignore any suggestion that a person can vote on Election Day without a PVC. “For the avoidance of doubt, I wish to call Section 47, Subsection 1 of the Electoral Act 2022. It says, and I quote, ‘a person intending to vote in an election shall present himself with his voter’s card to a presiding officer for accreditation in the polling unit in the constituency in which his name is registered.’ So, nobody can vote without his Permanent Voters Card. “The mandate of the Law is therefore clear. The PVC remains a mandatory requirement for voting.” FactCheck Elections can conclude that the WhatsApp broadcast message claiming that Nigerians can vote without their permanent voter card provided they had registered with the Independent Electoral Commission (INEC) is FALSE.

Claim: A strand of wool on the head stops hiccups.,"Claim: A strand of wool on the head stops hiccups. Verdict: False. Although several techniques/tricks are suggested to eliminate hiccups, placing a thread or wool on the head is not one of them.  The involuntary contractions of the diaphragm, popularly known as hiccups, can result from a large meal, carbonated beverages or sudden excitement.  Everyone must have had an experience with hiccups at one point or another, and for most people, it is usually not severe and lasts only a few minutes.  Recently, a Facebook user, Esther Mark, while sharing her experience with hiccups, insinuated a strand of wool stops hiccups.   “I quickly touched my head, and what did I find? A strand of wool on my hair to obviously stop the hiccup,” part of her post read.  This belief is an age-long one held by many in Nigeria and other parts of Africa. Many today still believe this, as seen in a Twitter poll conducted by this researcher. From the poll result, 43% of the respondents believe this claim, 38% do not, and 19% are neutral. This belief most likely informed the decision of the Facebook user’s husband. But how true is it? The popularity of this belief and requests prompted us to verify it.  The medical term for hiccups is singultus. Lifestyle factors like eating too much or too quickly, consuming carbonated drinks and spicy foods, being stressed or emotionally excited, drinking alcohol, or being exposed to quick changes in temperature could cause it.  These types of hiccups can usually be prevented by changing your habits, like eating smaller amounts per serving, eating slower, avoiding spicy foods, drinking less alcohol, avoiding carbonated drinks, and practising relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing or meditation, to reduce stress. When hiccups become severe and last more than two days causing problems with eating, sleeping or breathing, it is time to see a doctor as it may be a sign of underlying medical conditions like gastroesophageal reflux (GERD), stroke or multiple sclerosis. An article by health line suggests posture techniques that can help relax the diaphragm, which is responsible for hiccups. Some of these techniques include measuring breathing, holding your breath, breathing into a paper bag, hugging your knees, and compressing the chest. An article by the United Kingdom National Health Service (NHS) agrees with some of these techniques. Studies have also revealed having an orgasm, and rectal massage are potential treatments for intractable hiccups. In severe cases, medications like baclofen (Gablofen), chlorpromazine (Thorazine) and metoclopramide (Reglan) are prescribed. According to the National Organisation for Rare Diseases (NORD), treating intractable hiccups often involves drug therapy with chlorpromazine (Thorazine), haloperidol, and metoclopramide. If the hiccups occur during anaesthesia or surgery, the treatment is usually ephedrine or ketamine. Hypnosis has been used in some patients, as well as acupuncture.  The NORD also added that surgical procedures, such as injections into the phrenic nerve or severing the phrenic nerve in the neck, have been used in cases where all other therapies have failed. Although several techniques or tricks have been suggested to eliminate hiccups, placing a thread or wool on the head is not part of it.  Also, looking at the cause of hiccups shows no relationship between a strand of wool/thread on the head and hiccups.

"Claim: Joe Igbokwe, a chieftain of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), shared the photo of a tweet purportedly made by Atiku Abubakar, presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). The tweet had quoted Atiku as saying he gifted $10 million to Bishop David Oyedepo after the cleric prayed for him.","As is typical of election season, the buildup to the 2023 general elections has witnessed a proliferation of electoral disinformation. In some cases, members of opposition parties commit the blunder of sharing reports that indict the members of the other parties. However, they do not take care to verify the information. Recently, Joe Igbokwe, special adviser on drainage and water resources to Babajide Sanwo-Olu, governor of Lagos State, shared the screenshot of a tweet purportedly made by Atiku.  The tweet, posted on a Twitter account identified as @TheAtiku, reads, “After the renowned Pastor of Living Faith prayed for me, I whispered, ‘Those jets would not fuel themselves.’ He laughed. I gave him a generous gift of 10 Million Dollars to support his ministry. Thank you for the prayers. God bless you.” The tweet was accompanied by pictures of the PDP presidential candidate and Oyedepo sharing a handshake among other officials present.  For context, Igbokwe is a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and a staunch supporter of Bola Tinubu, the party’s presidential candidate, who is Atiku’s challenger for next year’s election. Igbokwe, who has over 139,000 followers on Facebook, shared the snapshot of the post to his page with the caption, “Can this be true?”. As of the time of filing this report, the post had been shared 17 times.  DUBAWA checked the Twitter handle @TheAtiku and observed it was not the official handle of the former Vice President. Atiku Abubakar; verified Twitter handle is @atiku, and every tweet (post) on the account is signed off with -AA. This was not in the post shared by Igbokwe.  Meanwhile, the handle @TheAtiku has been suspended on Twitter. From different searches of past activities of the account on the micro-blogging platform, it was discovered that the account was identified as a parody account.  Also, the tweet shared by Igbokwe had been made as far back as 2018 and the latest activities by the account (@TheAtiku) was in 2019. A Twitter user, @ChiromaHope, had, as far back as 2018, compared the parody account to the real account of the presidential aspirant, pointing out the differences between the two. Moreover, a reverse image search of the screenshotted tweet using Google reverse image on Duplichecker showed that the original image surfaced online on October 11, 2018, when Atiku met with the cleric.  Atiku, at the time, posted the photo on his Twitter handle with the caption, “Thank you for the prayers, Bishop Oyedepo. God bless Nigeria.” There was no mention of any money donated or any mention of private jets.

Claim: A Facebook user alleged that football fans trooping to Qatar for the world cup are smuggling beer into the country by disguising Heineken as Pepsi.,"It is chilled for moments! Great for the celebrations! Beer has been an enjoyable part of football for spectators at home and those watching live at the stadium. But the 2022 World Cup in Qatar is unlike any before it. It is the first to be held in the middle east and the first to have a hosting country lose its opening match.  Interestingly, just two days before the tournament’s first match in the Muslim nation, officials announced that fans wouldn’t be allowed to drink beer at the country’s eight World Cup stadiums, a reversal of a previously announced policy. Just after the announcement, images of Heineken canned beer disguised as Pepsi started to make rounds on social media and were even published by some news outlets. The narrative suggested that despite the bans on beer in Qatar, some fans are still devising means to smuggle the commodity into Qatar.  One Nnamdi Abana, who described himself as a Political Scientist and a  graduate of Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka, Nigeria, posted the same picture on his Facebook timeline, adding that fans will find another way to smuggle beer since they have been caught via this means.   “So, what did they do? They decided to shortchange the system by rebranding can beer with Pepsi. Now that they’ve been caught, they may look for another option.” The statement reads. Igetalk, a blog site that publishes sensational content, featured the story to insinuate that the disguised cans of beer can easily be smuggled into the stadium by the visiting tourist.  “…the beer cans in beverage casing and wrappings will then be smuggled into the stadium in Qatar by the visiting tourists…” “They would also be sold in the stadium, though there would most likely be a secret channel for doing this. Imagine an unsuspecting visitor buying a can of Coke, only to get a mouthful of Heineken,” the statement reads. Ubuntu Jacob Navro, a Facebook user, even gave the exact number of the canned beer smuggled into Qatar by football fans; in a Facebook post he made, Jacob said over 800,000 was the number of beers intercepted in Qatar.  “Customs at Qatar has intercepted over 800,000 cans of Heineken branded as Pepsi this morning 🍻Who no like enjoyment 😃😃😃, this Qatar Heineken pass Navrongo beers 🍻” the post reads. The world cup is already in its first week, and against all odds and controversies, Qatar has brought the competition home. As fans around the world enjoy the competition, it is essential to verify lingering claims that have a potential impact on the competition.  DUBAWA first conducted a forensics analysis to verify if this was real and not doctored. Results from Forensically, an online tool that offers image verification, reveal the acclaimed image is actual and not doctored in any way.  After that, DUBAWA carried out a Google reverse image search to uncover the source of the image. Results show an image of the Heineken canned beer disguised as Pepsi that has been circulating since 2015. In 2015, The Telegraph published a news story headlined:  “Smugglers attempt to enter Saudi Arabia with 48,000 beer cans disguised as Pepsi.” The same story was published in Morocco World News with the caption:  “Saudi Arabia Seizes 48,000 Cans of Heineken Beer Disguised as Pepsi” Both levels featured the acclaimed picture used to paint a scenario in Qatar. In 2015, Police in Saudi Arabia confiscated over 48,000 Heineken beer smuggled into the country disguised as Pepsi-Cola cans. The scenario unfolded at the Al Batha border between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, where officials stopped a truck carrying the contraband, based on reports by several Saudi news reports. “The smuggler tried to enter the goods in an innovative way, as stickers indicating that they were soft drinks “Pepsi” were placed on the “beer” cans, but that attempt failed after it was detected and thwarted by Saudi customs.” The report read. The batch on the arm of the officer is also that of Saudi Arabia Customs and not that of Qatar.  Even more, there is no publication in any Qatar news outlets that reported on the acclaimed narrative. The scenario happened seven years ago in Saudi Arabia, not recently in Qatar.   The alleged image with the narrative of smuggled beer into Qatar is false. The actual scenario happened seven years ago in Saudi Arabia, where officials intercepted attempts to smuggle beer disguised as Pepsi into the country.

"Claim: The presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu, stated that the solid minerals sector contributed less than one per cent to Nigeria’s GDP.","Claim: The presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu, stated that the solid minerals sector contributed less than one per cent to Nigeria’s GDP. Verdict: True On Thursday, November 10, 2022, the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate Bola Tinubu claimed that the solid minerals sector contributed less than one per cent to Nigeria’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). He made this assertion while speaking at a town hall meeting with the mining and agro-processing stakeholders in Lafia, Nasarawa State.  During the meeting, the presidential candidate lamented that Nigeria was well-endowed, given its industrious, energetic population and vast inventory of land, water, and other natural resources.  He said that the solid minerals sector contributed less than one per cent to Nigeria’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). According to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the Gross Domestic Product (GDP)  can be derived as the value of all goods and services available for final use and export.  During election campaigns, politicians are fond of quoting figures to swing public sentiment in their favour, and it is incumbent that politicians be held accountable for what they say. Hence, we decided to check the veracity of the statement. Having thought of the imperative of verifying the veracity of this claim, we sought to identify the volume of the solid minerals in Nigeria, at least in 2021. First, we sought evidence from the 2021 mineral production report by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) which revealed that the grand total of solid minerals production at the end of 2021 was 89,482,541.07, suggesting an increase of 39.19% from 2020 outputs which stood at 64.29 million tons.  The report, released in July 2022, also added that Limestone, Granite, and Laterite were the three biggest minerals mined in 2021. What does this translate to in monetary value? How much contribution does the total output add to Nigeria’s Gross Domestic Product?  To answer these questions, we proceeded to find more evidence.  According to the NEITI audit released in 2020 (the 2021 audit report is being awaited), Nigeria’s total GDP in 2020 was ₦152.32 trillion, with the solid minerals sector contributing N686.64 billion, representing 0.45%.  In 2021, according to World Bank data and Trading Economics analysis, Nigeria’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) increased to 440.78 billion US dollars, amounting to approximately N173.5 trillion, a value which represents only 0.05 per cent of the world economy. Yet, despite this increase, the Central Bank of Nigeria’s Economic Report for the third quarter of 2021 affirmed that the solid minerals sector contributed the least to Nigeria’s GDP growth with a mere 0.01 US Dollar = 4.4 Nigerian Naira (NGN).  And what does the CBN figure translate to in terms of percentage contribution to national GDP?  Dataphyte analysis of the NBS report shows that the mining and quarrying sector’s total contribution to the GDP increased from 368.9 billion in 2019 to 1.101 trillion in 2021. This means the sector’s contribution to the country’s GDP increased from 0.26% in 2019 to 0.45% in 2020.  In 2021, the sector, having increased in productivity to 89,482,541.07 million tons, still contributed 0.63% to the total GDP of 440.78 billion US dollars, amounting to approximately N173.5 trillion. In March 2022, the executive secretary/CEO of NEITI, Dr Ogbonnaya Orji, also confirmed that Nigeria’s solid mineral sector was contributing less than one per cent to the nation’s GDP, having risen from 0.18% in 2018 to 0.29% in 2019.  Based on information from multiple sources, Bola Tinubu’s claim that solid minerals contribute less than one per cent to Nigeria’s GDP is true.

"Claim: A viral video shows international Hollywood actors holding placards that display support for the Labour Party presidential candidate, Peter Obi.","It began with Idris Elba, a popular British actor laughing with Matthew McConaughey – a 53-year-old American actor – who held a placard. On it was a statement that reads, “Yes, it makes sense. Vote Peter Obi in 2023 🇳🇬.” For the next 1 minute 53 seconds, the stage was shared between different international actors like Tom Cruise, Doug Liman, Gerard Butler, and 50 Cent. All held the same board with the inscription. As Nigeria prepares for its Presidential election on February 25, 2023, a video showing popular international movie actors campaigning for Peter Obi – the Labour Party’s flag bearer – naturally ruffles more feathers as it portrays an international endorsement for the party, widely considered a political underdog at the poll. However, the placard’s texture raises questions. Also, the actors’ words were silenced as only sounds played from the video. It seems glaring that the footage was altered. But two notable persons shared the video via their verified social media accounts to their large followers with captions that denoted their political allegiance.  Charles Oputa, known as Charly Boy, is racking up more than 247,000 views on Twitter with the video he tweeted on November 21, which also gained more than 14,800 reactions, 7,082 retweets, and 1,222 comments. The veteran singer wrote, “Impressive. Peter Obi’s campaign has taken on a global outlook with leading American TV and Hollywood actors driving the campaign.” Mike Asukwo, a veteran cartoonist, also shared the video on his verified Facebook account today with the caption, “I just want to be proud of my country again.” As of press time, the video has gained more than 5,600 views, 171 comments and  515 reactions. 197 accounts have also shared it. An account with the username, Lu Benson, prayed in pidgin that the dream [Obi’s victory] should come true because Nigerians have endured enough. He said, “God abeg make this dream a reality. We’ve suffered a lot nah.” Another account, Awele Ideal, expressed her interest in the video and requested that it be sent to her. The same video gained trends on Tiktok too. An account with the handle, @@sheks_bibi, shared the video with the caption, “Peter Obi for President 2023 #peterobi #2023election #vote.” As of press time, the video has gained 5,489 likes, 383 comments and 1,953 shares. The comments on the posts showed that people believed the footage to be valid. This made DUBAWA run a fact-check to verify. DUBAWA ran a manual check on the video and found a YouTube handle, Eva Luca, who uploaded a replica of the video 3 months ago. The difference is the inscription on the placard. It reads, “Your text, photo or logo here,” meaning it can be edited. About 39 actors were listed in the video that was uploaded on July 23, which included the previously mentioned.  The footage also showed how users could alter the video collections available. Attempts to uncover the particular tool used for the video editing were unsuccessful, though there are diverse apps that can be used for the purpose. DUBAWA discovered the videos separately in their original formats through further findings. They were all obtained from a YouTube channel owned by WIRED, an American magazine that “illuminates how technology affects every aspect of life–from culture to business, science to design,” according to the website description. The channel runs a programme called the Autocomplete Interview, where popular American entertainers are brought to the channel to answer the web’s most searched questions about them displayed on a placard. For comparison, we obtained screenshots of Terry Crews, a famous American actor and television host, from the three situations available. Screenshot of Terry Crews on the original WIRED video.

Claim: There is an international airport in the middle of Zamfara Forest where Great Britain carts away Zamfara gold.,"Claim: There is an international airport in the middle of Zamfara Forest where Great Britain carts away Zamfara gold.  The video is false. It is originally from Guatemala. However, it is unclear if there is a gold exchange between the Zamfara State government and Great Britain.  Zamfara, which is in the north-western part of Nigeria, is one of the states in Nigeria that boasts of gold deposits and other solid minerals such as Iron-ore, Copper, Tantalite, and Manganese. But over the years the state made the news for controversial reasons due to the illegal mining of its gold and tussle over controlling other mineral resources existing in its domain. In 2019, the Nigerian government permitted artisanal mining of gold in some Northern states, including Zamfara. The states were also allowed to manage some other solid minerals in their domains.  President Muhammadu Buhari launched the Presidential Artisanal Gold Mining Development Initiative (PAGMI), a comprehensive artisanal and small-scale gold mining development programme “to foster the formalisation and integration of artisanal gold mining activities into Nigeria’s legal, economic, and institutional framework.” This policy attracted criticisms from many quarters, including the outburst by the current governor of Delta State, Mr Ifeanyi Okowa. He alleged discrimination because states in the Niger Delta were not allowed to manage their oil and gas resources. The Nigerian government later cleared the air regarding ownership of gold deposits in the states. It vested control of all mineral resources on the federal government, according to the 1999 constitution, section 44 (3) and item 39 Schedule II of the Exclusive Legislative List. This was explained by the Nigerian Minerals and Mining Act 2007 (“the Act”) which was passed into law for the purposes of regulating the exploration and exploitation of solid materials in Nigeria.  On the issue of illegal mining in Zamfara State, the Nigerian government had several times blamed the violent crimes in the state on illegal mining activities.  Just recently, a video showing an airplane moving in a forest was shared widely on Facebook. The video can be found here, here and here. In the video, the voice of a man could be heard claiming the video was shot in Zamfara even as he alleged that the state government was shipping gold to the international market without the knowledge of the Nigerian government.  He further claimed that the aircraft was purportedly owned by Great Britain who was doing illegal business with the Zamfara government.  According to the man, the Zamfara government has struck a deal with bandits, who in turn used the aircraft to ship gold and other items such as wood. In his argument, the unidentified man noted that while Zamfara had no existing international airport, the Nigerian government placed a no-fly zone on the state as a result of the shady deals going on in the state. He said: “This is the airplane that was caught on camera transporting gold out of Zamfara. You will remember that two weeks ago, the Federal Government placed a no-fly zone on Zamfara, despite the fact that the state has no airport. But could you imagine what we’re seeing here right now, is this not an airport? This is an airport in the middle of the forest. “This video came out recently and the person that revealed this video asked that his face should not be shown on the video. This video has gone viral on the internet and it is one of the reasons why the Federal government had to place a no-fly zone in Zamfara. Zamfara normally has no airport so why did the government place a no-fly zone? Garba Shehu, the Senior Media Adviser to President Buhari, said jets were actually seen transporting gold out of Zamfara.  “You guys could remember that Zamafara said they are selling their gold to the CBN. In fact, Bello Matawalle met with Buhari and said Zamfara is ready to mine their gold. Zamfara has a mine.  “There’s information that this private jet is owned by Britain and it is carting away Zamfara gold and this is in conjunction with the Federal government but from the look of things, I don’t think the Federal government is involved in this and that was why they placed a no-fly zone on Zamfara. “I think this is a shady deal that the Zamfara government struck with those bandits. You know the bandits have taken over the forest. They began logging wood, mining gold, and transporting these woods through heavy-duty helicopters to nearby Niger. From Niger, they’ll fly it out abroad. That’s what they’re doing, and they know that Chinese companies are hungry for resources. They are looking for these natural resources, and the Nigerian government has already barred them from illegally tapping our resources. They’re resorting to any means to get these resources.  “When the FG placed a no-fly zone on Zamfara, that was not a welcome idea, and even the House of Assembly condemned the Federal government resolution. You could see that because of this, Zamfara gold and their illegal mining have sparked a severe outrage in the country, especially in the South-South, where governors of the South-South have begun to clamour for resource control. “The information we have is that this aircraft is not only used to cart gold. We learnt the destination is Dubai, the international market. This is an illegal business. You can imagine a situation where another foreign entity comes to your domain and start tapping your resources. It’s a disgrace; it shows that nothing works in Nigeria.” DUBAWA subjected the video, which is now circulating on Facebook, to analysis on Invid, a toolkit designed to assist in fact-checking through video verification.  The result showed that the same video had once been shared last year following the Nigerian government’s announcement of a no-fly zone over Zamfara State.  On March 2, 2021, President Muhammadu Buhari declared a no-fly zone over Zamfara state as a result of the banditry ravaging the state.   National Security Adviser, Babagana Monguno, told journalists at the time that the president also banned all mining activities in the State. This, he said, was to curb the rising insecurity in the State.  He said the intelligence and security communities ”have been mandated to go after all non-state actors, whose activities have been fueling chaos, for prosecution.” He said the president ”has charged the new service chiefs to reclaim all areas under the control of bandits, insurgents and kidnappers, kidnappers and all others involved in criminal activities across the country”. “We are not going to be blackmailed. The government has the responsibility to assert its will. Citizens can reside wherever they want to reside. Anybody who is a criminal should be brought to book,” Mr Monguno said. Two years earlier, in May 2019, the Nigerian government announced a total ban on mining activities in Zamfara State and its environs owing to the relationship between the bandits and illegal miners.  A no-fly zone has been described as a geographic location over which aircraft (manned or unmanned) have been forbidden to fly. This depends on the area and the specific regulations and can be for military, security, safety or privacy reasons. It can be used to protect sensitive areas, such as royal residences, or brought in temporarily over sporting events and large gatherings. After the announcement by the Nigerian government, there were several speculations that certain aircraft were being used by criminals to exchange gold for arms in the state. Daily Trust at the time quoted presidential spokesman, Mr Garba Shehu, who said there are strong suspicions that gold was being swapped for arms by criminal elements operating in the State. “Even in Zamfara, there is a strong suspicion that some of those choppers are being used to ferry arms for bandits and also to evacuate gold illegally smuggled out of the country, so the country loses everything in the mining. “As you are aware, the Nigerian gold market is a big business and the government wants to do two things at the same time by doing this; end banditry and economic sabotage through the smuggling of gold,” he said.  Subsequently, a video circulated on the internet at the time showed a moving plane in the forest. It was alleged that the plane was used to cart away gold from Zamfara.  It has been shared widely on Facebook including here, here, here and here. Zamfara has remained a hotbed of insecurity particularly with the ravaging banditry, kidnapping for ransom amid other crimes. The result of a keyframe analysis on Invid showed that the video had been shared online since February 2020. It was shared here, here and here. “Narco jet impounded by the Guatemalan Government. Take off is performed by a Guatemalan Air Force pilot!” reads the caption of the video shared on February 6, 2020. In a report by 1001crash.com, the plane in the video was the Hawker Siddeley HS-125-700A which was discovered in the forest with a fake registration and a removed interior.  According to the report, the aircraft was impounded by the Guatemalan government over suspicions that it was involved in narco-trafficking. Another report by the drive in February 2020 noted that the video was that of the Hawker Siddley 125 business jet that landed on a very rough strip in Guatemala on January 27, 2020.  Meanwhile, a picture posted on the Guatemalan army Twitter handle @Ejercito_GT at the time showed the same registration number as the one seen on the aeroplane. The caption of the post was written in Spanish, but with the use of Google translate, it was clear that the jet was discovered in Peten. The tweet reads in English, “#EjercitoGT locates (sic) in the department of Peten, a jet which was transporting possible illegal activities. Waiting for authorities to carry out the corresponding legal procedures.” This came at a time when there was an increase in the activities of drug-bearing aircraft and vehicles in Guatemala, Belize and Mexico. Meanwhile, a reverse image search on the photo of the aeroplane using Duplichecker reveals that the registration number on the plane; N818LD was on a very similar jet that landed in Belize on April 24, 2018.

"Claim: “The price of rice in Sierra Leone is US$50,”- Samuel Tweah","In April of 1979, Former President William Tolbert increased the price of a 100-pound bag of rice from $22 to between $26 to $30, ignoring the fact that many Liberians at the time lived way below the poverty line in the country. The justification for Florence Chenoweth, then minister of agriculture, was for rice farmers to increase rice production instead of relying on imported rice. The increase in the price of rice urged Gabriel Baccus Matthews to form an opposition group called the Progressive Alliance of Liberia (PAL) to the government of Tolbert. Recently, the rice debate has taken centre stage in the country, following scarcity of the cereal leading to skyrocketing prices. On many occasions, Liberians were seen in long queues and even spending sleepless nights at various rice warehouses across the country in search of rice, the country’s staple food. As a result, President George Weah, in a statement, constituted a Rice Stabilization Taskforce to ensure the availability of the country’s staple food on the Liberian market. According to the statement published on the Liberia Executive mansion website, the Liberian leader named the Ministries of Agriculture, Finance and Development Planning, Commerce and Industry, State for Presidential Affairs, and Justice as part of the task force.  The statement indicated, “the others are the Liberia Chamber of Commerce, Mayor Jefferson T. Koijee, Mayor, Monrovia City Corporation, National Port Authority, Mr Steve Flahn-Paye, Coordinator Japanese Counterpart Value Fund and Hon. Charles Bright, Economic Advisor to the President of the Republic of Liberia.” Appearing on a local radio show, “Spoon Talk”, aired on Spoon FM and TV, the Liberian Minister of Finance and Development Planning (MFDP), Samuel Tweah, claimed that the price of rice in neighbouring Sierra Leone is US$50. Minister Tweah asserted that Liberians should be grateful that the Weah-led government is keeping the price of rice down way below the price in Sierra Leone. In Minister Tweah’s words, “Ghanaians are protesting for Microeconomic reasons. The price of rice in Sierra Leone is fifty dollars, we’ve been keeping it down, and investors are calling and asking us why Liberia is doing better.” This show was carried on the institution’s live Facebook page with over 20k viewers, 11k comments, over 500 shares and 1k emojis. This claim is made at 1:33:1-25 seconds in the over four hours show aired on November 9, 2022. Considering the importance of rice as a staple food in Liberia and consequently a political commodity in the country, DUBAWA embarked on a fact-finding mission to ascertain if the comment made by the Liberian Minister of Finance is true or false. We first decided to contact the Finance Minister, Samuel Tweah, to provide information on the type of rice and where precisely in Sierra Leone it was sold for $50, to enable us to verify the assertion, but he failed to respond, as seen here in the WhatsApp conversation. Through our correspondent in Sierra Leone, Fayia J Moseray, DUBAWA contacted local business people within the Sierra Leonean market who provided us with the price of the various types of rice in the market.  Bella rice or Pusawa is being sold for 580les, equivalent to US$30 to 35. OAU is being sold for 550les, amounting to US$25 to 27.  Fen Fen is also being sold for 550les amounting to $25 to 27. DUBAWA also spoke to some rice traders in Freetown who sell rice per bag to verify the assertion made by Samuel Tweah, Liberia’s Finance Minister. One of the traders said some rice brands vary from 500 to 680 new leones. He noted that Pusawa rice is sold at 510,000 and 530,000 (510 & 530 Nles) for the big bag; OAU rice is sold at 500 & 510 leones; Bella-Bella rice is sold at 550 leones, and Jasmine rice is sold at 580 leones. DUBAWA visited another shop around Kroo Town Road in the Western part of Freetown. A trader told DUBAWA that the Fen-Fen rice is the most expensive rice, which is sold for 680,000 old leones (680 Nles), equivalent to some $32 to $35. Of all of these prices, none is equivalent to the $50 the minister mentioned as selling price for a bag of rice in Sierra Leone. Following the interaction with local business people in Sierra Leone over the price of rice, it is safe to conclude that the assertion by Liberia’s Finance Minister, Samuel Tweah, that a bag of rice is sold for US$50 in Sierra Leone cannot be substantiated. Per our investigation, the highest price a bag of rice in Sierra Leone is being sold is US$35.

"Claim: A LinkedIn user alleged that Orji Uzor Kalu, a serving Senator and former Governor of Abia State, is hiding stacks of money in his house.","From sensational stories about a “tribe where the bride’s aunt must have sex with the groom to test his potency – Bayankole Tribe”, to controversial pro-China-Russia propaganda riddled on his LinkedIn timeline, EkeneDiliChukwu Okafor, who described himself as an independent Journalist and Entrepreneur has shared several false information in recent times.  His latest video depicts stacks of cash piled in a room which, according to Mr Ekene, were discovered in the home of Orji Uzor Kalu, a former governor of Abia, a state in the southeastern parts of Nigeria. Mr Ekene shared alongside the video a short caption calling the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to go after Kalu.  “EFCC needs to go after @Orji Uzo Kalu, former governor of Abia state. Look at how he stacked European currency in his house.” Within 24 hours, the post attracted diverse remarks. While many users who commented on the post expressed doubts, others affirmed it, expressing satisfaction with the recent decision by the Central Bank of Nigeria to change the Nigerian currency. One Twitter user, Temitope Kade, who probably believes the claim, sighed in resignation.  “Oh, my days!!! What a nation,” she remarked.  Marc-Oliver Nguenti, another user, described the post as fake news. In his view, the assertion is a made-up movie.  “Fake news!!! This was made up for a movie,” he challenged.  Orji Uzor Kalu is a Nigerian politician with a controversial past. He is a current Senator representing Abia North Senatorial District and Senate Chief Whip. The Senator was also a two-term Governor of Abia State from May 29, 1999, to May 29, 2007.  In December 2019, a court of law convicted and sentenced Kalu to 12 years imprisonment for N7.65 billion in fraud. However, on Friday, May 8, 2020, the Supreme Court of Nigeria ruled that his trial was wrongly executed and freed him. Being a member of the ruling party, the All Progressives Congress (APC), the false allegation widely spread on social media to trigger public condemnation of Kalu and his party. When the Nigerian Coalition of Fact-checkers’ (NCF) subjected the alleged video to analysis on the InVid video verifier tool, results showed the clip had surfaced in different contexts with a similar narrative.  In 2019, the video appeared in the Cameroonian social media space, alleging that the Cameroonian minister of defence was hiding money in his house and his wife was attempting to burn it before police discovered it. The claim‌ referred to Edgar Alain Mebe Ngo’o, former Cameroonian minister of defence, suspected of embezzlement. The same video also made headlines in Russia in the same year, alleging that Rauf Arashukov, a Russian Senator, had discreetly tried to burn money he had embezzled and stashed in his office. The contention came around the time when Arashukov was arrested on the accusations of murder.  However, none of these narratives was true. The actual story links back to Alejandro Monge, a Spanish artist who crafted a three-metre-tall sculpture of money stashed in a room. The art was titled the “European Dream,” and was entirely hand-painted to give it a money-like look. Since then, it has been displayed in the 3-Punts gallery in Barcelona and somewhere in Madrid, the Spanish capital.  Monge posted this video on his Instagram page and further debunked the heralding claims. His post, originally in Spanish, highlights the need for people to question whatever they see on the internet before believing it. He expressed dismay, adding that it is essential for people to know who first shared a post and the reason behind it before sharing it.  “Monge_art: It’s what the internet has that something is not knowing because it goes viral… and then no one knows what it is or to whom it belongs… thank you for sending me where you are going to see them from NY to WhatsApp groups all over the world. Well, if people knew it’s a sculpture and the notes are hand painted. @monge_art.” In 2019, Monge told France24 that the way his art was depicted on social media came to him with mixed feelings. Admitting that, he felt flattered and, at the same terrified.  “When I saw that my installation had been misappropriated in Russia, I had mixed feelings about it. At first, I laughed a lot and was flattered that my sculpture could fool so many people, which meant it was realistic. But then, I started to get a bit afraid because it was connected with a scandal in Russia, and I didn’t want to be associated with that in any way,” Monge said.  He explained that his art speaks about modern society and money’s influence on almost everything people do. “My installation is a commentary on modern society and how everything revolves around money. I believe that money is the god of contemporary society.” Monge clarified that the money is not real and it’s, in fact, hand-painted.  “My sculpture is made up of about 500,000 hand-painted fake bills made out of resin,” he stated.  The alleged video depicting a room stashed with money said to be hidden by Orji Kalu in his house is mis-contextualised. Monge, a Spanish artist, originally shared the video on his Instagram page to showcase a piece of art he crafted as money stashed in a room.  This claim is false.

"CLAIM: The Special Assistant to the President on public affairs and Assistant Principal Spokesman for the All Progressive Congress (APC) presidential campaign council, Ajuri Ngelale, stated in an interview that Nigeria became the highest producer of rice in Africa under the current administration.","CLAIM: The Special Assistant to the President on public affairs and Assistant Principal Spokesman for the All Progressive Congress (APC) presidential campaign council, Ajuri Ngelale, stated in an interview that Nigeria became the highest producer of rice in Africa under the current administration. Findings made by DUBAWA revealed that Nigeria is indeed the largest producer of rice in Africa. Also, Nigeria has ranked 14th on the global scale of rice production in recent years. Election periods come with debates and points to prove. For the ruling political party, the standards of judgement can be higher than others, as the electorates find such moments to question the past activities of the administration. In preparation for the February 2023 Presidential election, the Special Assistant to the President on Public Affairs, Ajuri Ngelale, and Assistant Principal Spokesman for the APC presidential campaign council appeared on Channels TV’s Politics Today. In defence of the ruling party fielding Bola Tinubu as the presidential candidate, Ajuri – during the interview with Seun Okinbaloye – said Nigeria is now the largest producer of rice in Africa, compared to 2015. This was obtained in a tweet shared by David Offor with the caption, “Dino Melaye, Daniel Bwala, and Dele Momodu put together can’t match the brilliance of Ajuri. Baba is a blessing to Bola Tinubu’s campaign.” The shared video, lasting for two minutes and 19 seconds, had Ajuri praising the current administration for agricultural reforms in the country. Starting from exactly one minute, 14 seconds, he said, “On the other hand, if you look at the manifesto, you’d also find on page 27 [in reference to Tinubu’s presidential manifesto] when we talked about agriculture and his excellency Asiwaju Bola Ahmed’s plans for agriculture, he makes clear on page 27 that we are building on the successful foundation laid by President Muhammadu Buhari in agricultural reform in the country. We went from a situation in 2015 where we were the largest rice importer in Africa. Today, we are the largest producer of rice in Africa.” As of press time, the tweet has been viewed 9,554 times. It has also gained 840 likes, 375 retweets and 102 comments. The cost of a 50kg bag of rice, at ₦35,000 as of press time, left room for doubt in his statement. This made DUBAWA run a fact-check. Before the start of the Buhari-led administration in 2015, Nigeria spent $2.41 billion in three years on rice importation, according to the central bank’s governor, Godwin Emefiele. DUBAWA discovered that the CBN introduced funding programmes like the Commercial Agriculture Credit Scheme and the N220bn Micro Small and Medium Enterprises Development fund to aid local farmers in Nigeria. Also, the Federal government declared a ban on importing rice, among other goods, on June 23, 2015. Fast forward to February 2022, Nigeria’s rice mills have increased from 10 to 68, according to the CBN governor. He revealed that the combined capacity has also increased from 350,000 metric tonnes to about three million. Further findings revealed that Nigeria had topped the African chart of countries producing more rice.  According to the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), Nigeria ranks 14th globally as of 2020, while China holds the top slot. Egypt, Tanzania, and Madagascar are the only African countries making the top 20 list. The United States Department of Agriculture’s Foreign Agricultural Services also corroborated the increased rice production from Nigeria. In the November 2021 circular released by the organisation, Nigeria produced 4.89 million metric tonnes of rice, while Egypt came second with roughly four million metric tonnes. Though the price of rice is currently higher than in 2015, Ajuri’s claim that Nigeria produces more rice than other African countries is true.

Claim: Any US dollar printed before January 2021 will not be acceptable from January 2023.,"On October 26, 2022, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) announced it had redesigned major naira notes and that the notes would be distributed starting from December 2022. The new notes include N200, N500 and N1000. Mr Godwin Emefiele, the governor of the apex bank, explained that the initiative is to allow for control of the currency in circulation, manage inflation, and tackle counterfeiting. The CBN’s plan has continued to elicit mixed reactions. As expected, many photos, videos, and texts have been shared widely on Facebook, Twitter, and other social media platforms. However, some of them are false. One of such is a viral social media post stating that the United States government has set a deadline for the legal status of dollar notes printed before 2021. DUBAWA observed that the post is currently being shared on Facebook, Twitter, Whatsapp and some blogs. Also, the exact report was posted on a prominent news site, Nairaland. According to the post, dollar bills printed before 2021 will no longer be accepted as legal tender worldwide by January 2023. The policy was implemented to curb billions of illegal dollars in dollar bills in African countries. Also, the report notes that the agreement was reached at a meeting held on November 2, 2022 between the United States Federal Reserve Bank, Office of the Comptroller of Currency, IMF, World Bank and Governors of Africa’s Central Banks. The post further claimed that US President Joe Biden “has written to the British Government and European Union to tour (sic) the same line and redesign their currencies accordingly to frustrate those with ill-gotten money in US dollar, British Pound Sterling, and Euros.” Some of these posts credit Reuters News as the source of their information. DUBAWA did a keyword search on the official website of Reuters News to ascertain the veracity of the information and found there was nothing of such on the news agency’s website.  Also, there was no meeting between officials of the United States Federal Reserve Bank, Office of the Comptroller of Currency, IMF, World Bank and Governors of Africa’s Central Banks on November 2, 2022, as claimed by the author of the post.  A search on the official Twitter handle of the United States Federal Reserve showed that the day’s event was a press briefing by Jerome Powell, Chair of the Federal Reserve of the United States. Other agencies/bodies mentioned in the report had no major meeting on the same day.  The USD (United States Dollar) is the official currency of the United States of America. According to the information on the US government website, paper currency comes in seven denominations: $1, $2, $5, $10, $20, $50, and $100.  It is usually printed by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP). The Bureau is also responsible for redesigning money with new appearances and enhanced security features. No recent announcement on the Bureau’s website of any currency redesign exists. Meanwhile, in 2013, the United States Department of the Treasury selected the $10 note for redesign, highlighting security requirements as the primary drive. Also, it was established that the Secretary of the Treasury makes the final decision on currency design as specified by the Second Legal Tender Act of July 11, 1862, and 12 USC 418. It is also the duty of the Advanced Counterfeit Deterrence (ACD) Steering Committee to recommend a note for a redesign. The ACD conducts due diligence for security features that can be used to deter counterfeiting. The ACD Committee consists of representatives from the Department of the Treasury, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the United States Secret Service. A check on the US Currency Education Program revealed that “it is the US government policy that all designs of US currency remain legal tender, regardless of when they were issued. This policy includes all denominations of Federal Reserve notes, from 1914 to the present.” A further check reveals that the United States dollar was first established as a world currency in the Bretton Woods Agreement of 1944. The gold was the basis for the US dollar, and other currencies were pegged to the US dollar’s value. Hence linking the naira redesign to the supposed policy is baseless. The United States central bank is known as the Federal Reserve System, not the *Federal Reserve Bank.* It performs five general functions to promote the effective operation of the US economy and, more generally, the public interest. There was no information on naira redesign from the Federal Reserve System from the supposed date of the meeting till the time of filing this report.   From the information available online, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) has the following responsibilities: It charters, regulates and supervises all national banks, federal savings associations, federal branches, and foreign banks agencies.  It is also an independent bureau of the US Department of the Treasury, and the unit does not deal with the redesign of currency. The report that the United States government is set to checkmate dollar stockpiles in Africa is false. There is no evidence to support the statement.

"Claim: Ghana, Sierra Leone, and 18 other African countries have been banned from travelling to the United Arab Emirates.","On the night of Tuesday, October 25, 2022, information widely made the rounds in Ghana that the United Arab Emirates had placed a 30-day visa ban on citizens of Ghana as well as 18 other African countries and one non-African country. According to the information, published by national mainstream news media portals, such as citinewsroom, and international news outlets like The BBC NEWS PIDGIN and DW Africa, effective October 18, authorities from the UAE  would not be posting 30 days visa applications for the affected countries.  Sierraloaded, an online portal in Sierra Leone, also reported that a ban had been placed on Sierra Leone. “Authorities in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have announced a visa ban slapped on Sierra Leoneans and 20 other nationalities seeking to visit Dubai with immediate effect,” excerpts of the publication read. Except for the Dominican Republic, all other  countries purportedly are in Africa. Aside from Ghana and Sierra Leone, the other countries supposedly affected in  Africa include Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Comoros, Congo, Democratic Republic of Congo, Guinea Bissau, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Nigeria, Republic of Guinea,  Rwanda, Senegal, Sudan, The Gambia, and Togo. To ascertain its veracity, DUBAWA has independently verified the information. By the United Nations Security Council Resolutions, a member state can impose a travel ban on listed individuals by preventing transit or entry into their country. These listed persons must be deemed to have committed or are likely to commit acts of terrorism and other human rights abuses. Also, by International Health Regulation (2005), countries can impose travel bans “to prevent, protect against, control and provide a public health response to the international spread of disease…”  As part of DUBAWA’s verification in Ghana, we combed the website of the United Arab Emirates, but no news was found on the ban. Though Citinewsroom did not name its source, our contact at the online news portal indicates the information was sourced from DW Africa, which, according to our source, was the first to publish the story. But DW Africa itself did not attribute the claim to anyone in particular. DUBAWA then proceeded to verify from official sources at the Embassy.  DUBAWA’s independent checks at the United Arab Emirates Embassy in Accra have revealed that the UAE has not placed any visa ban whatsoever on Ghanaians. According to Mikdad Mohammed of the Trade and Investment Desk at the Embassy, who is also in charge of media relations, while it is true that the UAE has issued stricter visa terms for some African countries, including Nigeria, it is false that Ghana is part of the affected countries. He explains that the UAE has restricted certain visa categories to, for example, Nigerians under 40, except those applying for family visas, due to their likelihood of overstaying, adding that Ghanaians are exempted from all of those ‘stricter’ restrictions. He, thus, urges the Ghanaian community to treat the Tuesday information in the public domain as “unsubstantiated rumours”. “You can quote me anywhere. There is no official ban on visa issuance [to Ghanaians]. We are still issuing visas to the public without any hindrance. “Stricter visa terms have been issued for some other African countries, including Nigeria, but the same has not been extended to Ghana. Treat news of the visa ban as uninstantiated rumours,” he urges. Mikdad’s information has been confirmed by the Embassy Public Relations Officer (PRO), Haruna Abdul Rashid. When DUBAWA sought to know the nature of the relationship between Ghana and the United Arab Emirates, Mikdad replied that a solid tie exists between the two countries.   In Sierra Leone, DUBAWA reached out to Mohamed Massaquoi, Press & Information Attache for Sierra in the UAE, through his Facebook Messenger to verify the statement and determine the conditions under which those bans, if true, were imposed. “There is no ban on Sierra Leoneans, as of this time of responding to you!” Massaquoi replied, adding that the UAE has not communicated any information regarding a travel ban on Sierra Leone to the Embassy.  The Press Attache on the alleged UAE travel ban on Sierra Leoneans at  the Embassy vehemently dismissed the assertion concerning the travel ban on Sierra Leoneans, adding that such information has not come to the notice of the Embassy. “The attention of the Sierra Leone Embassy in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has been drawn to social media reports claiming the UAE Government has issued a visa ban on Sierra Leoneans and several African nationals. The Embassy wishes to state that it has NOT received any information on the same from official sources in the UAE and therefore considers the said reports being circulated as false and misleading,” the release disclosed. “Consequently, we encourage all Sierra Leoneans planning to visit the UAE on tourism and business purposes to go ahead with their visa applications as planned,” the press statement added.  DUBAWA also contacted Sierraloaded, the platform that published the story, to find the source of the claim, but there has since been no response from the media organisation. According to official information, the United Arab Emirates has not issued any visa ban for Ghanaians and Sierra Leoneans willing to emigrate to that country.

"A Twitter user shared a video of stacks of cash, stating the pile is the new Nigerian Naira.","A Twitter user shared a video of stacks of cash, stating the pile is the new Nigerian Naira. The acclaimed new Nigerian currency in the video is the Euros, not the new Naira notes. The video was taken from a different context to form the new narrative. The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) recently announced it has redesigned some Naira notes and would by December 2022 start circulating them. N100, N200, N500, and N1000 denominations are the affected ones.  As a result of the new CBN announcement, a Twitter user, (DIVINE T) @Folasheycrown22 has shared a video of the supposed new Nigerian currency. She captioned the video, “The new Nigeria Currency y’all???” The video has attracted more than 25,000 views, 1,000 likes and hundreds of retweets since it was shared on Twitter. In the comments, Ahmed Musa LP (@generalzango) disagreed with the tweet. “This can’t be the new Nigerian currency! The memo didn’t include 10 Naira,” he commented. Q (@tokqboy) also believed the supposed new Nigerian currency is from another African country. “Looks like South Africa currency,” he shared. Meanwhile, Poet Fela nPGM (@neo_pelz_), another commenter, noted that CBN should keep the new Nigerian currency safe. “All these should be stamped with samples. People in charge will start stealing them soon,” he commented. The diverse and conflicting views surrounding the tweet led DUBAWA to carry out an analysis that will correctly inform the public about the new Nigerian currency, especially if they are released.  To verify the video and its location, DUBAWA employed the InVID tool, which helps verify videos by analysing their content and providing keyframes to conduct a reverse image search. The tool provided a few key frames of the ten-second video in question and attempted a reverse image search which showed there were no similar images. However, taking the currency samples in the acclaimed video revealed they were not Naira but Euros. First, the supposed N10 notes in the video are not part of the denomination CBN said it would change. The announcement is limited to the N100, N200, N500, and N1000 denominations. Notably, only N200 and N100 notes in the video were readily noticeable due to the poor quality of the video. Hence, we compared the colour and design of the notes to other currencies and found out they were Euros and not Naira. The CBN introduction of the new Nigerian currency is also scheduled for December and is yet to be released for circulation. CBN governor, Godwin Emefiele, said the new money would begin circulating from December 15, 2022. Reverse image search, using InVid keyframes, did not show up with similar images. However, the on-screen analysis of the video suggests that the supposed new Naira currency is the Euro currency. Hence, the tweet is false.

"In a few months, Nigeria’s electoral body, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), will conduct the general elections.","In a few months, Nigeria’s electoral body, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), will conduct the general elections. The presidential election will be conducted on Saturday, February 25, 2023, by 18 candidates from various political parties.  On September 28, 2022, the electoral body announced the official campaign season’s commencement; since then, manifestoes and policy documents have been rolling in. Some candidates had theirs published prior to the time.  It is common practice for candidates seeking elective offices to intimate voters of their plans and programmes for governance if they get into power.  A good manifesto is a party’s policy offerings to the voters before an election. It includes an analysis of the costs and projected outcomes of implementing proposed policies. This educates members of the electorates and assists them with a choice of candidate and political party. Bola Tinubu, presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), and his running mate, Kashim Shettima, former governor of Borno State, recently released an action plan for governance. The 80-page document, titled “Renewed Hope 2023 – Action Plan for a Better Nigeria,” highlighted key economic issues to be addressed during their governance.  In the document, several sections were attributed to Mr Tinubu, boasting of his many achievements in Lagos State, where he was governor from 1999 to 2007. Mr Tinubu promised to replicate the same governance method he used to transform Lagos into a mega city, making Nigeria a great nation. On page 11 of the document, Mr Tinubu discussed the importance of Agriculture to the economy but raised concerns about the increase in urban population. The presidential candidate said from 1960, when Nigeria gained independence, till date; there has been a significant increase in urban population from 15% in 1960 to over 50%. “Agriculture has traditionally been the backbone of this nation and will continue to be. However, we must acknowledge the growing importance of our urban population,” the document reads. “At independence, city dwellers represented less than 15 per cent of the national population. Today, the urban populace exceeds 50 per cent. Over 100 million people reside in our cities and towns.” Also, on page 26, the presidential candidate noted that a little less than 49 per cent of the population dwells in rural areas. Only 35 per cent of the arable land in the country was being cultivated. On youth population, Mr Tinubu said young people aged between 15 and 35 “account for over 65 per cent or over 130 million of our 200 million people,” adding that the unemployment rate in the country is about 33 per cent.  But how true are these assertions? DUBAWA fact-checked some of them to ascertain their veracity. “At independence, city dwellers represented less than 15 per cent of the national population. Today, the urban populace exceeds 50 per cent. Over 100 million people reside in our cities and towns.” Urban population refers to the population of persons living in urban areas as defined by national statistical offices. In the agenda plan for the 2023 elections, Mr Tinubu stated that less than 15% of the populace lived in the city at independence. He said this has significantly increased to over 100 million persons (50%) over time.  Nigeria gained independence from British colonialism in 1960. According to data from the United Nations (UN) showing World Urbanisation prospects, Nigeria’s population in urban areas in 1960 was 15.4% of the total population.  Also, data from World Population Review showed that Nigeria’s population at the time was approximately 45 million, with a total of 6,955,837 urban population representing 15.41% of the total population.   Data from Worldometer shows that the country’s population in 2022 is currently 217 million, with about 107 million urban population representing 52% of the total populace in 2020.  The statement that less than 15% of Nigerians lived in urban areas at independence is false.  The assertion that over 50% of the total populace now lives in urban areas is true.   “Even today, a little less than half the people live in rural communities, equally earning their livelihoods from the soil and, in the process, helping to feed the nation. However, only 35% of arable land in Nigeria is presently cultivated.” Four sub-activities comprise the Agricultural sector: crop production, livestock, forestry and fishing. In the second quarter of 2022, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) noted that agriculture contributed 21.90% to the nominal Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Despite its high potential for economic growth, the agricultural sector in Nigeria has been bedevilled with many challenges, particularly the insecurity that has caused farmers to abandon their farmlands. Other issues include climate change, lack of adequate finance, and low technology. As established, over 52% of Nigerians live in the urban areas leaving the rest of the populace in the rural areas. However, not everyone in rural areas can be said to be into agricultural production. Is it true that only about 35% of arable land is being cultivated? Nigeria boasts of large tracts of arable land. A report by Statista in 2019 showed that the country has about 70.8 million hectares of agricultural land area, out of which 34 million hectares are arable land; 6.5 million are under permanent crops, and 28.6 million hectares are under permanent meadows and pastures. A 2018 estimation shows that around 78 per cent of land in Nigeria is used for agriculture with, 37 per cent of arable land. While there is no official data for arable land in 2022, in September 2022, Dr Mohammed Abubakar disclosed that 56 per cent of Nigeria’s arable land is underutilised while 44 per cent of agricultural land is being cultivated.  There is insufficient evidence to back the statement that only 35% of arable land is being cultivated in Nigeria.

Twitter to start charging $20 per month for verification.,"Following Elon Musk’s takeover of Twitter last week, many policies have been speculated to come under review.  In a report released by a technology news outlet, The Verge, on Monday, October 31, 2022, it was announced that there are plans to increase the optional monthly subscription paid by Twitter users to a somewhat higher price, which will include verified users as well. The monthly $4.99 subscription, known as Twitter Blue, gives subscribers access to published ad-free articles. But it is now being hinted that the package will soon have a new $19.99 price tag. Subscribers have a 90-day ultimatum to subscribe to the package or risk losing the badges.  It has been reported that the employees under Mr Musk, who has now picked the nickname “Chief Twit,” are under pressure to ensure that the new verification process is completed and implemented by November 7, 2022, or risk getting dismissed from the company. On Monday, October 31, 2022,  a Twitter post by The spectator Index (@spectatorindex) hinted that Twitter will charge $20 a month for the verification badge.  Screenshot of the Twitter post by The Spectator Index.  In less than 18 hours, the tweet garnered over 11,000 retweets, over 8,000 quote tweets and over 50,000 likes. While some Twitter users made fun of those already verified, others said they would not pay. The virality of the claim and the impact it will have on many verified accounts, many of which are journalists, prompted us to look into this claim.  DUBAWA immediately conducted quick searches on Twitter, trying to reconcile the claim with any open tweet Mr Musk made, but found none.  Although the social media company intends to generate half of its revenue from subscriptions, Mr Musk has not come out to clearly state a new price tag for the subscription. The Tesla and SpaceX boss, also a free speech advocate, had been critical of some of its policies and regulations before the purchase of Twitter and had openly indicated, upon ownership, that it would no longer be the usual status quo.  After he purchased the App, Mr Musk tweeted, “the bird is freed.”  Screenshot of Elon Musk’s Tweet after purchasing the App.  In his reaction to a Twitter user @johnkrausphotos who had openly made a plea that his account be verified since he uploaded photo contents related to space and rocket launches and had good followership, Mr Musk noted that the verification process is being revamped.  Screenshot of Elon Musk’s response.  This hinted at the possibility of changes by the tech mogul to the verification details for both subscribers and intended, but this does not show it will be cost-related. Mr Musk is yet to mention what these changes are. Similarly, a quick search about the claim on Google immediately linked the researcher with The Verge’s news report, which seemed to be the origin of this speculation.  The report in an effort to link this to Mr Musk, referenced his rather broad-context tweet that his company will make some changes regarding verification. Although Mr Musk has announced that a new verification process was underway for verified subscribers, our findings show he has not mentioned what the change will be or if it would be cost-related.

President George Weah told the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in 2019 that he would have implemented the War and Economic Crimes Court upon his return.,"Since the end of the 14 years of civil unrest, Liberians at home and abroad have been calling for establishing of a war and economic crimes court to prosecute the country’s perpetrators of war and financial crimes. The plea for justice is summed up in a story published in 2021. Even the now-ruling Coalition for Democratic Change led government, while in opposition, was the key champion for the country’s war and economic crimes court. The party held a series of protests demanding that the then-ruling Unity Party (UP) establish the court, a call that did not materialise. After winning power, the party made a profound u-turn, as seen here. Also, a Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) was established by the TRC Act in 2005 to “promote national peace, security, unity and reconciliation.”  It was also set-up to make it possible to hold perpetrators accountable for gross human rights violations and violations of international humanitarian law that occurred in Liberia between January 1979 and October 2003. Since the end of the war, not a single Liberian has been prosecuted for their role in the war. Instead, some of the perpetrators are now being rewarded with top government positions such as senators and representatives, leaving their victims wallowing in economic deprivation.  Appearing on a talk show, the Okay Conversation aired on Okay FM on Monday, October 24, 2022, the national youth chairman of the opposition ruling Unity Party, Melvin Cephas, stated that President George Weah told the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in 2019 that he would implement the War and Economic Crimes Court upon his return. Cephas further stated, “After telling the UNGA in 2019 that he would have implemented the war and economic crimes court, President Weah got back here and did nothing in that direction but only for him to return this year to tell some Liberians in the United States that Liberia looks like Miami.” The show, which was carried live on the station’s Facebook page, had about four hundred comments, over four thousand viewers and over one hundred and ninety emojis, and this statement is made at 2:23:1-18 seconds  Considering the importance of this claim and how sensitive it is for the people of Liberia, DUBAWA embarked on a fact-checking mission to investigate exactly what the Liberian leader told the UNGA in 2019. Through research, DUBAWA accessed the speech delivered by President George Weah at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in 2019 and found as follows; the nine-page statement covered a variety of issues including the global crisis, poverty eradication, and quality education. However, pages five to seven focused largely on the war crimes and how the Liberia people have dealt or intend to deal with it.  “When I spoke before you last September, after my first 9 months in office, I indicated a preference for dialogue as a conflict-resolution mechanism, so that as a Government and People, we could together focus our efforts on poverty-reduction, growth, and economic development, rather than on retribution.  “However, since that time, there has been a rising chorus of voices from many quarters calling for the establishment of an economic and war crimes court. These voices include thousands of war victims and some of the alleged perpetrators, who seem to wish to either clear their names or their conscience.  “Support for the establishment of the court has also been voiced by many international organizations, as well as some of our international partners.  “Mr. President, we are at a loss to understand why the clamor for the establishment of the court is now being made, almost a full decade after it was first called for, and during which time no such pressure was brought to bear on the government that grew out of the Accra Peace Accord,” the president stated. “Considering the importance of this matter, I have already begun consultations with our National Legislature – the representatives of our people – and we intend to have a broader engagement with the Liberia Judicial System and with our strategic International Partners and Organisations to determine pertinent issues such as legal framework, timing, venue, and funding, among others,” he added.  DUBAWA read the speech delivered by the president at the UNGA and found no promise to implement a war and economic crimes court. DUBAWA also watched the entire address by President George Weah during the UNGA 2019 presentation to be sure that what was in the script was exactly what was read by the president. From 10:49-16:19 portion of the video, the Liberian leader spoke about ways to bring lasting peace and stability to Liberia, just as in the script.  At no point did he promise to implement war and economic crimes court. Even though President George Weah spoke about the adverse impact of war crimes on the people of Liberia during his UNGA speech, he did not promise to implement the war and economic crimes court for Liberia.

The information is false. The video was not taken at a campaign rally; neither was it shot at Ondo. Preparations are in full swing as the 2023 Presidential election draws nearer. Most political parties with candidates for the country’s top seat have commenced campaigns. However, for the All Progressive Congress (APC), the official campaign is yet to begin due to internal issues in the party. Recently, a video went viral on Twitter. The footage shows masquerades chasing people while some are beaten as they scurry. Twitter influencer, Demagogue PhD said that the video was taken at an APC campaign in Ondo on October 13, 2022. He also said the masquerades used the moment to show their grievance against the ruling party. He wrote, “Yesterday, APC in Ondo went for a rally for Tinubu in the state. But the gods were so angry that they came to whip them home.” The tweet has garnered more than 4,896 reactions, 2,738 retweets, and 945 comments as of press time. It has also gained more than 188,000 views. However, DUBAWA observed that the gathering had no evidence to prove it was a political campaign rally. After scanning the comments, DUBAWA found nobody who could attest to the incident in Ondo. Findings made by DUBAWA revealed that most masquerades in Ondo use palm fronds in reference to Ogun (god of iron), their ancestral deity. However, there was no sign of the masquerades wearing palm fronds or using them throughout the 29-seconds video.  A manual keyword search of masquerades chasing people at gatherings, however, led DUBAWA to a report on September 18 about masquerades chasing people away from churches in the Shikal community, Langtang South Local Government Area, Plateau State. The report also quoted the state Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Alfred Alabo, confirming the incident through the DPO of the area. He disclosed that the situation was under control after masquerades went to a Church and disrupted their activities. The video was not from an APC campaign rally, neither was it from Ondo State.

"Nigeria has grappled with over ten years of insurgency, particularly in the Northeast region. Since 2009, the Boko Haram insurgency has claimed thousands of civilians’ lives, lost property, and displaced millions of people.","Nigeria has grappled with over ten years of insurgency, particularly in the Northeast region. Since 2009, the Boko Haram insurgency has claimed thousands of civilians’ lives, lost property, and displaced millions of people.  The sect is believed to be fighting to overthrow the government and establish an Islamic state.  Boko Haram is a combination of the Hausa word “boko,” which means “Western education” and the Arabic word “haram” which figuratively means “sin” and literally means “forbidden.” While military efforts were intensified against the activities of members of this sect, the terrorism ‘demon’ multiplied, having many horns: banditry, abductions, and farmer-herder conflicts, among others.  On Tuesday, October 18, 2022, the Chief of Defence Staff Lucky Irabor revealed that Nigeria has lost 100,000 lives and spent $9 billion (about N3.24 trillion) on the Boko Haram insurgency in the country. General Irabor stated this on the last day of the third Ministerial Performance Review Retreat held at the Presidential Villa in Abuja.  Ahead of the 2023 general elections in Nigeria, the campaign season officially opened, as the Independent National Electoral Commission announced. Several political parties have intensified campaign rallies across the country as significant contenders pay visits to different states of the federation.  On Monday, October 17, the presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Peter Obi, was in Kaduna State to participate in the Arewa Joint Committee Interactive Session.  While speaking at the event, Obi said the North has the world’s highest number of out-of-school children. He also stated that the region has the highest number of school kidnappings worldwide. The former governor further asserted that the North has Nigeria’s highest number of IDPs. Claim 1: The North has the highest number of out-of-school children worldwide. The United Nations Education Scientific and Cultural Organization defines out-of-school children as those in the official primary school age range who are not enrolled in either primary or secondary school. The Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG 4) aims to “ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all.” This agenda includes ten targets, one of which is to ensure that all girls and boys complete free, equitable and quality primary and secondary education leading to relevant and effective learning outcomes by 2030.  The latest Global Education Monitoring Report released by UNESCO in September 2022 states that 244 million children and youth between the ages of six and 18 worldwide were out of school in 2021. This includes 67 million children of primary school age (about six to eleven years), 57 million adolescents of lower secondary school age (about 12 to 14 years) and 121 million youth of upper secondary school age (about 15 to 17 years). Meanwhile, the study suggests that the out-of-school population is growing in sub-Saharan Africa, with 98 million out-of-school children recorded in the region.   The UNESCO Institute of Statistics (UIS) estimated Nigeria’s out-of-school population to be 19.7 million, ranking third out of the top ten countries with out-of-school people. India ranked first with a total out-of-school population of 56.4 million using 2020 model estimates and 61.0 million with the UIS estimate since 2015. Pakistan has the second largest out-of-school population, pegged at 20.7 million, while Ethiopia and China (about 10.5 million) have the fourth and fifth largest out-of-school people.  However, Nigeria has the largest population of out-of-school children of primary school age: 9.6 million in 2020, up from 6.4 million in 2000 and 7.5 million in 2010. Image showing the out-of-school rates in six countries from 2000 to 2020. Primary education, according to UNICEF, is typically designed for children 6 to 11 years of age. While 90 per cent of children attend primary school globally, in poor households, that drops to 74 per cent. The situation is worsened in both West and Central Africa, where less than 30 per cent of the children from the poorest households complete primary education. In all of these, there is no evidence to back the claim that members of this population are prevalent in Northern Nigeria.  Verdict: False! India, not Northern Nigeria, ranks higher in the number of out-of-school children, according to recent data by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO). The data showed Nigeria only ranks higher in the number of out-of-school children of primary school age. Claim 2: Northern Nigeria has the highest number of school kidnappings worldwide. There is insufficient evidence to back the claim that Northern Nigeria has the highest number of school kidnappings in the world, although the region recorded over 1,000 abductions between 2020 and 2021. The issue of school kidnapping was first reported in Nigeria in 2014 when Boko Haram insurgents abducted 276 girls from the Government Secondary School in Chibok, Borno State. Ever since, attacks on schools and abductions of students have grown in number and are spread across the northern part of the country. Peter Hawkins, the United Nations Children and Education Fund UNICEF representative in Nigeria, said in October 2021 that about 1,436 schoolchildren and 17 teachers were abducted from Nigerian schools between December 2020 and October 2021.  He also noted that school kidnapping incidents were more prevalent in the country’s north-central and North-west geo-political zones. In February 2018, militants stormed Government Girls Science and Technical College, Dapchi, Yobe State, kidnapping more than 100 girls.  As of April 2022, 11,536 schools had remained closed since December 2020 due to abductions and insecurity-related issues, according to a statement signed by UNICEF Communication Specialist Samuel Kalu. According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, Boko Haram militants have abducted, recruited, and exploited thousands of children since inception.   From 2017 to 2019, the UN verified 5,741 grave violations against children in north-east Nigeria: 1,385 children had been recruited and used by Boko Haram.  Meanwhile, the ranking of countries on kidnappings per 100,000 by the UNODC in 2017 indicates that Belgium had the highest level of reported/recorded kidnapping incidents, followed by Canada and South Africa.  Meanwhile, data from Statista showed that in 2021 alone, over 101,000 kidnapping cases were reported across India. However, there were no specifics as to whether it was abduction of school children. Verdict: Insufficient evidence. While Nigeria’s education system has suffered setbacks due to the increase in the abduction of school children, there is no evidence to support the submission that the country’s northern region has the highest number of school kidnappings in the world.  Claim 3: The North has the highest number of internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Nigeria. IDPs have been described as “persons or groups of persons who have been forced or obliged to flee or to leave their homes or places of habitual residence, in particular as a result of or to avoid the effects of armed conflict, situations of generalised violence, violations of human rights or natural or human-made disasters, and who have not crossed an internationally recognised border.” Data from the internal displacement monitoring centre for Nigeria has shown that there were about 3.2 million internally displaced persons as of the end of 2021 out of the 53.2 million internally displaced persons worldwide.  Image showing data of internally displaced persons in Nigeria at the end of 2021. The IDMC further attributed internal displacement in Nigeria to activities of Boko Haram and other non-state armed groups (NSAGs), particularly in the Northeast. Also, it noted that the cause of displacement is “criminal and inter-communal violence driven by competition for resources that are aggravated by climate change has escalated in recent years in central, north-central, and north-western regions, and continued to do so in 2021.” While the available data has not stated the number of IDPs in the different regions, both the IDMC and UNHCR established that more Nigerians had been forced out of their homes, especially in Northeast Nigeria and the country’s Middle Belt.  Also, a report by Dataphyte noted that there are about 143,110 IDP camps in Nigeria, out of which 84% are located in Borno State, Northeast Nigeria.  Verdict: Out of the over three million IDPs in Nigeria, most of them are from the Northeast. Well researched. But let me correct an impression here. If the northern region have the highest number of out of school children in the primary schools, is that enough concern? Secondly, statistics shows that the rate of kidnapping from schools in the north is higher compared to the southern region. Thirdly, IDPs are more in the northern region compared to the southern part. Finally, pls, bring your analysis to facts within the Nigerian context and not juxtaposing it with other countries. Thank you. Note that I am not in any political party but let us appreciate people who point out facts. Nigeria must get it right this time.

I had 78% of the popular votes of the Liberian people’ – Weah,"With just a year to go for the next Liberian elections, parties and candidates have switched into campaign mood, promising to fulfil old pledges and make new ones. One such candidate is President George Weah. In a video that has already gone viral, George Weah is heard claiming to have won 78% of the popular votes of the Liberian people during the 2017 Presidential election in Liberia. The Liberian leader’s comment is contained in a viral video circulating on social media under a Facebook name Under The Palava Hut. He is addressing scores of Liberians at a programme. According to President Weah, he said: “I have a price here. We went to elections; remember, I had 78% of the popular votes of the Liberian people. Those with 1%, 1.5%, 0.6% etc, do not tell me anything that will discourage me from doing my work.” The statement is made at precisely 0:22 seconds to 0:50 seconds of the video.  President Weah’s assertions are a direct jab at his critics within the opposition community, suggesting that candidates with such insignificant electoral votes do not have the mandate to direct him on what to do as president. He is convinced that his party has the overwhelming support of the population a few months before the 2023 Presidential and legislative elections in Liberia. Due to the virality of the claim and the controversy it has generated, DUBAWA embarked on a fact-check mission to ascertain the truth. On October 10, 2017, Liberians went to the polls to elect a new President to replace then Africa’s first female President, Madam Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, whose tenure had ended. According to the National Elections Commission (NEC) results in the first round of the 2017 elections, President George Weah of the Coalition for Democratic Change (CDC) garnered 596,037 votes amounting to 38.37%. His rival, former Vice President, Ambassador Joseph N. Boakai of the then-ruling Unity Party (UP), came second with 446,716 votes constituting 28.76%. After a protracted legal battle over election fraud which eventually ended up at the Highest Court of Liberia, the Justice ordered a rerun of the election. Consequently, there was a run-off election between the two top candidates out of the 20 candidates who contested for the Liberian presidency. On December 26, 2017, Liberians again went to the polls to decide the winner between the two leading candidates and to give that winner the mandate to govern. It was at this round of the election, according to the National Election Commission (NEC), that the former soccer icon, now president of Liberia, secured a total of 732,185 votes accounting for 61.54%, while his contender received a total of 457,579 votes representing 38.46%, to enable George Weah become the President of Liberia. According to the International Foundation for Electoral System (IFES) data, George Weah won the Liberian 2017 Presidential election in the first round with 596,037 votes amounting to 38.37% and in the run-off, the West Africa Brief report indicated that President Weah won with 732,185 votes accounting for 61.54%. Based on all of the data provided by the National Elections Commission (NEC) of Liberia on the 2017 Presidential and legislative elections, data from the International Foundation for Electoral System (IFES), and the West Africa Brief, it is evident that the assertion by the Liberian leader that he won 78% of the popular votes of the Liberian people is false. Rather, he obtained 38.37%  during the first round and 61.54% during the second round. ",FALSE,20/10/2022,https://dubawa.org/false-president-weah-did-not-win-78-of-votes-in-2017-election/
"President Muhammadu Buhari said that 38.7 million, representing 35 per cent of total eligible Nigerians targeted for COVID-19 vaccination, have been fully vaccinated against the virus.","On October 17, 2022, President Muhammadu Buhari, at the last Ministerial Performance Review Retreat of his administration at Abuja, said 38.7 million Nigerians have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19, representing 35 per cent of the total eligible population targeted for vaccination. This was contained in a statement issued by Femi Adesina, his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity.  Since the outbreak of COVID-19 in late 2019, there have been concerns about safety and survival, particularly in developing African countries with little to no health facilities to deal with the pandemic.  The World Health Organisation (WHO) in April 2020 warned that Africa could become the next epicentre of the pandemic, noting that the outbreak might likely kill at least 300, 000 people in Africa and push nearly 30 million into poverty. According to data from Worldometers, as of October 18, 2022, there are about 630, 670, 164 diagnosed coronavirus cases worldwide, with 6,573,608 deaths.  Of this number, only 265,741 cases have been confirmed in Nigeria and 258, 993 cases have been discharged while 3,155 deaths have been recorded in 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). Nigeria had set a goal of vaccinating 40 per cent of its over 200 million population before the end of 2021, and 70 per cent by the end of 2022, following the WHO’s recommendation. Ahead of the vaccine rollout, the Executive Director of the NPHCDA, Faisal Shuaib, explained that the federal government planned to vaccinate all eligible population from 18 years and above, including pregnant women. However, Nigeria has so far failed to meet its set target. At the end of 2021 and as of August 2022, only 27.7 million eligible persons had been fully vaccinated. Further checks by DUBAWA on the NPHCDA website revealed that 45, 044, 523 Nigerians have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 as of October 16, 2022.  This figure represents 40.3 per cent of the population as against the 35 per cent given by the president.  Also, the COVID-19 vaccination update on the website shows that 12, 734, 476 (11%) of the eligible population have been partially vaccinated against the virus.  President Buhari’s assertion that 35 per cent of Nigeria’s eligible population had been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 is inaccurate. The correct figure is 40.3 per cent.

Claim: Public sector wage bill size was increased to 70% of the country’s expenditure totalling $320 million under Johnson Sirleaf.,"A known supporter of the Weah-lead administration has said the erstwhile government under President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf left behind an unsustainable wage bill.  According to Samuel Jackson, an Economist, the wage bill under the former administration ballooned to 70%, amounting to $320 million. He said this left the government with little or no space for capital investment, which was essential in building post-war Liberia.  He made the claim during a debate with Amos Tweh, Secretary General of the immediate past administration, the Unity Party. The debate was held on a local radio station, Okay FM 99.5, and was carried live on the station’s Facebook page on September 19, 2022.  The claim by Mr Jackson was made at two hours and five minutes of the almost three-hour show. According to Jackson, due to this huge wage bill inherited by the CDC-led government, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) requested the Weah-led government reduce the country’s wage bill. He said this led to the government harmonization plan during the first two years of the Weah administration. This action by the government led to a series of protests by some civil servants in the country. The IMF defines the wage bill “as the total compensation, in cash or kind, payable to a government employee in return for work. It includes wages and salaries, allowances, and social security contributions made on behalf of employees to social insurance schemes (IMF, 2014b).” According to the IMF working paper titled: Fiscal Implications of Government Wage Bill Spending, the higher the wage bill, especially in developing countries, the greater the fiscal imbalances. With this in mind and the huge public interest this debate has generated, DUBAWA decided to investigate the claim made by Mr Jackson. During the research, DUBAWA discovered that the last approved national budget of the country under former President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, 2017/2018 puts the size of the country’s wage bill at 59% of total expenditure, amounting to $298.020,404 million. This is found on page xiii (3) of the 2017/2018 approved national budget of Liberia. Again, page two of the USAID report: Process mapping study, pay and payroll reform in the government of Liberia also confirms that the wage bill for the 2017-18 financial year was 57% of the Government of Liberia’s total expenditure. This is found under the caption ‘Fiscal Conditions.’  Following an investigation into the claim, DUBAWA can conclude, based on official documents available, that Liberia’s wage bill in the final year of former President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf’s administration was not 70%. It was 59%, according to the budget statement of 2017-18.  ",FALSE,12/10/2022,https://dubawa.org/false-public-wage-bill-under-former-president-ellen-johnson-sirleaf-was-never-70-of-total-expenditure/
Claim: Big eaters cannot have peptic ulcer,"Over time, people have come to believe they can’t have peptic ulcer if they eat very well but is it only people with poor eating habits that have peptic ulcer? Recently, a colleague of this writer shared her ulcer diagnosis experience where she couldn’t accept she had peptic ulcer because she is a big eater and had always believed ulcer only affects small eaters. If peptic ulcer can affect big eaters what then is the cause of peptic ulcer? Ulcers are sores that are slow to heal. They can take many forms and can appear inside or outside your body, from the lining of your stomach to the outer layer of your skin. There are different types of ulcers, some of which are arterial ulcers (leg ulcers), venous ulcers, mouth ulcers, peptic ulcers and genital ulcers. For this article, the focus would be peptic ulcer and its causes.  Peptic ulcers are sores that develop in the lining of the stomach, lower esophagus, or small intestine which is why they are sometimes referred to as stomach ulcers. Peptic ulcers are a fairly common health problem and one type of ulcer you can’t see. For most people, stomach pain is the first sign.  There are three types of peptic ulcers: gastric ulcer (this type develops inside the stomach), esophageal ulcers (this develops inside the esophagus), and duodenal ulcers (this develops in the upper section of the small intestines, called the duodenum). Someone can have both gastric and duodenal ulcers at the same time, which is known as gastroduodenal. A peptic ulcer can be caused by Helicobacter pylori bacteria (H. pylori), the use of some medication or other conditions or factors. H. pylori is the most common cause of gastric and duodenal ulcers because it affects the mucus that protects your stomach and small intestine, giving room for stomach acid to damage your stomach lining. Although it is unclear exactly how this bacterium spreads, researchers believe it’s mostly through unclean food, water, and eating utensils. H. pylori can also spread through saliva. Many people get this bacterial infection as a child, but it rarely develops into a peptic ulcer while most people don’t see symptoms until they’re older. Overuse of over-the-counter painkillers such as aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen and other anti-inflammatory drugs can lead to ulcers. Other factors that can contribute to ulcer formation, or are risk factors, especially in someone with H. pylori include heavy alcohol use, psychological stress, smoking, untreated stress and spicy food.  NOTE: These risk factors do not cause ulcers, but they can make ulcers worse and more difficult to heal. Two types of tests are available to diagnose a peptic ulcer. They are called upper endoscopy and upper gastrointestinal (GI) series. Many people with peptic ulcers will not have symptoms but others will. Some of these symptoms include burning stomach pain, bloating or belching, intolerance to fatty foods, heartburn, and nausea.  In severe cases, it can lead to vomiting or vomiting blood, trouble breathing, feeling faint, unexplained weight loss, and appetite changes. It is important to see your doctor if you experience these severe symptoms or if over-the-counter antacids and acid blockers relieve your pain only for a short while. Sometimes ulcers disappear on their own. Other times they require medical treatment to prevent serious complications. When left untreated, peptic ulcers can result in internal bleeding, perforation (a hole) in your stomach wall, obstruction (passage of food through the digestive tract could be blocked), and gastric cancer.  While a poor eating habit is a trigger for peptic ulcer, it is not the cause and you can be a big eater and still have a peptic ulcer.  Exactly what I was enlightening someone on, thank you for this piece. I will share it to the person. I’m much enlightened! Thank you.

Claim: WhatsApp message claims some codes can be used to check if a user’s call is being forwarded or not and stop it.,"On Tuesday, September 20, 2022, a message with the claim that scammers are diverting or forwarding people’s phone calls was shared on WhatsApp. Users were advised to dial a code to check this and stop it. The message notes that the code *#62# would show if a user’s call is being forwarded to another number or not while the code ##002# cancels this or deactivates it.  This message was shared by another WhatsApp user, naming MTN, Glo and Airtel as culprits of this act. Different versions of this message was shared with DUBAWA for verification, so we looked into it.  A keyword search led to a breakdown of how to deactivate call divert or forwarding by Calcare. This article by Calcare also explained how a user can tell if their call is being forwarded.  We reached out to the named telecommunication companies (MTN, GLO, and Airtel) via email and direct message on Twitter but only GLO responded.  GLO is its response via Twitter, said this is true as *#62# is the code to check call diverts, otherwise known as call forwarding, while ##002# is the code to check to cancel it. “*#62# is the code to check call diverts, otherwise known as call forwarding, while ##002# is the code to check to cancel it,” the message reads. Our researcher who is an Airtel user also tried the codes to see what it entails. Dialing the first code showed some of the researcher’s calls were being forwarded.

"Claim: A viral video making the rounds on social media, mainly on WhatsApp, depicts  Dino Melaye expressing his support for Peter Obi, the Labour presidential candidate, ahead of the 2023 general elections.","It’s a few months away from the general elections in Nigeria. As expected, social media is already agog with the narratives and discourses of politics.  Consequent to this reality, a viral video making the rounds on social media, particularly on WhatsApp, featured politician and former senator Dino Melaye eulogising and expressing his support for the Labour Party candidate, Peter Obi.  Mr Melaye, a former senator with a history of controversy, said in the acclaimed video that Mr Obi is the best candidate to unify Nigeria. He added that the movement should continue and everyone should be part of it.  “I wanna say, it is time for us to think. I encourage the crusade. The movement started by Peter Obi to continue, move from campus to campus, move from community to community, move from one progressive group and organisation in this country to another to campaign for the new Nigeria that is to come and be part of the movement,” Mr Dino was posed to have said in the 38 seconds video.  The video was traced back to a Tick-Tok account, @lolabearose, with the tag:  “Thank you, Mr Dino, for always saying the truth.” The claim has already garnered a significant amount of interactions, over 600 views, 300 likes and 80 comments. One user, @tapcurrent, apparently in consensus with the post, commented that PDP might merge with Mr Obi’s Labour party.   “Hahahahaha, they have started to revise the truth. Don’t be surprised that PDP will merge with LP.” Another user, @user kingh, hinted that Mr Malaye might switch from PDP to LP hopefully. “Mr Dino is coming into the Labour party this week by God grace and u are going to handle that aspect of the campaign,” the user stated.  There is some doubt as to the credibility of the video; just two days ago, Mr Malaye reinstated his support for PDP’s presidential candidate Atiku Abubakar. This twist now casts a reservation on the heralding claim.  DUBAWA first analysed the acclaimed video on Deepware, a tool used to determine whether a video is a deep fake. Results from the analysis verified that the video is not a deep fake but an actual one.  Further to that finding, DUBAWA also subjected the clip for analysis on InVid video verifier. Results from the video fragmentation revealed the acclaimed video was taken out of context from an original and more extended version.  On 1st July 2022, Mr Melaye shared a 6:35 minute video of himself with the caption: “Obi is a fantastic and a good man, but he lacks the capacity to unify Nigerians.”  In the video, Mr Malaye pledged his support for PDP’s Atiku Abubakar and downplayed Mr Obi’s candidacy ahead of the 2023 general election.  Mr Malaye further stated that Mr Atiku is a unifier and outlined some qualities which he believes make Atiku the best candidate to be president.  “So we need one Nigerian. Who is going to be trusted by every part of this country, who the north will believe in, who the south will believe in and that person without blinking eyes is Atiku Abubakar,” he asserted in the video.   Mr Malaye did say the exact words in the acclaimed video. However, the context was attributed to Mr Obi’s role as Atiku’s Vice President when the duo unsuccessfully ran for the presidential elections in 2019. The acclaimed 38 seconds clip was taken from the original video that is six minutes and twenty-five seconds long (6:25). Excised exactly at 4:30 – 4:58 timing of the original version to paint a somewhat different narrative.   In fact, Mr Melaye had further shared the same YouTube video on his Twitter account with the caption: “WATCH……SDM.   Peter Obi is Fantastic and a good man, but he lacks capacity to unify Nigerians. Unity is more important than cutting cost of governance.” The viral video making rounds on social media, depicting Dino Melaye expressing his support for Peter Obi, the Labour presidential candidate, ahead of the 2023 general elections is false. The video was taken from a more extended version that has little to do with the acclaimed narrative.

Claim: Video shows Queen Elizabeth II feeding Africans.,"The death of Britain’s longest-serving Monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, triggered both positive and negative comments from people all over the world.  She was Queen of the United Kingdom from February 6, 1952, until her death on September 8, 2022. A day after her death was announced, a video shared by kelly Muwana, was reshared by Egemba Uzoamaka with the caption “We have forgiven but not forgotten.”  The video showed two women in white spraying food at young children who were scrambling to pick them up.   This video triggered mixed reactions as some users in the comment section wished they never saw the video.  Cynthia Anyanwu wrote, “I wish I never saw this, my heart is broken” while Judith Obianuju wrote, “No wonder some people were not happy.”  Prince Okoye on the other hand said “…still I forgive you. Safe journey. But how can I invite this video?”  The original post by Kelly Muwana had the caption “the late Queen and our grandparents.”   This video has gone viral and was also being shared on WhatsApp. A request to verify this and the possible damage it could cause prompted us to verify this claim.  A keyword search showed this narrative has gone viral on Youtube, Tiktok, blogs and other social media platforms.  A reverse image search on different search engines led to different versions of the video. A 43-minute Youtube video shared three years ago by Cool Facts explains the video captured by the Lumiere brothers is that of a French woman throwing food at children of Indochina. Another version shared a year ago by Olden Days shows this was from 1900 when Vietnam was a French colony.  According to Olden Days, this was shot by Gabriel Veyre showing the daughter and wife of a French governor in French Indochina, which is today Vietnam, throwing coins at children. Screenshot of the video by Olden Days.  The video was also shared by History Upscaled with the same narrative as Olden Days. This video which didn’t have any sound over it had the voices of the children rushing to pick what was being thrown at them.  The earliest version of this video found was from 10 years ago by ativinnumotmaelandi with the caption “Indochina women throwing rice.” We also found fact-checks by Altnews and Politifact debunking this. Our findings show the woman throwing grains at children in the viral video is not Queen Elizabeth.

"Claim: A Facebook user claims that the daughter of Emmanuel Osodeke, the president of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) recently graduated from the University of Chicago.","Claim: A Facebook user claims that the daughter of Emmanuel Osodeke, the president of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) recently graduated from the University of Chicago. The claim is false. Mr Osodeke told DUBAWA that he does not have any daughter. Further findings revealed that the pictures attached to this claim were sourced from different websites.  Amidst conversations around industrial action embarked upon by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), Ekiti Princess, a Facebook user made a post to depict a graduation ceremony of an alleged daughter of Emmanuel Osodeke, ASUU president. The post, which has since been widely shared and republished by bloggers, sarcastically congratulates the president of ASUU and thanked him for keeping students at home while his daughter studied abroad. Attached to the claim is a collage of pictures showing a lady who took a pose with non-Nigerian students. The same attachment also featured Mr Osodeke. A description on the pictures reads:  “This is Juliana Chidera Victor Osodeke, Emmanuel Osodeke’s 21-year-old Last Daughter Who Recently Graduated From The University of Chicago, Illinois, United States.” This allegation has stirred debates among users who fault Mr Osodeke and a few others who doubt its authenticity. Hence, DUBAWA decided to run this check. DUBAWA contacted Mr Osodeke via a telephone call. Bluntly but clearly, he debunked the claim. “I don’t have a daughter. So why will my daughter graduate when I don’t have a daughter? How will I with my N400 thousand salary a month, pay school fees of ten million. You see, these are just the tactics of the government to see how they can create confusion within the system instead of solving the problem. It’s so sad,” he said This is further confirmed by a BBC Pidgin profiling, published sometime in 2021. Furthermore, we cropped the collaged pictures attached to this claim into segments and made reverse image searches on the individual results. Upon completion, the first photo was traced to a 2014 publication of My School Gist, a blog which praised one Anita Osariemen Omonuwa for being “the first black woman to graduate from the University of Reading UK with a first class degree”. The next photo was traced to a website which described the students seen as the “inaugural cohort of Obama Scholars” who graduated with Masters Degree from the “Harris School of Public Policy” at the University of Chicago between 2018 and 2019. While an image of Mr Osodeke could be identified, one of the collaged pictures did not produce a clear result. We, therefore, reverse-searched the last fragment and pinned it to a recent convocation ceremony that took place at the University of Chicago, Illinois, United States. While we were investigating the claim made, Ekiti Princess posted a follow-up comment which further proved the information shared as untrue. It reads: “Have seen the notification so many news have picked this post and cast it as a news  If this post is fake pls am so sorry Nigerians  “But pls let our government do something about this ongoing strike may God continue to help us in this country  My sincere apologies to Nigerians.”   Asides that the pictures attached to the claim were obtained from different websites, the ASUU president has told DUBAWA that he does not have any daughter.

"Claim: A Facebook page claimed that popular American TV Host, Steve Harvey, is in Nigeria to support the Presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Peter Obi.","Steve Harvey Sr. is a multiple award-winning American TV Host of the Steve Harvey Morning Show and Family Feud, among other television programmes. He began his career as a standup comedian when he hosted Showtime at the Apollo in the 1980s. The Nigerian version of his globally-watched Family Feud will debut in October, with famous Nollywood actress, Bisola Aiyeola, playing host. The 65-year-old comedian had only ever set foot on African soil when he visited the slave trade site in Ghana, Elmina Castle, about three years ago. However, it was surprising when a blog posted that Mr Harvey was in Nigeria to drum support for the Labour Party’s Presidential candidate, Peter Obi. The post further reads, “The American actor who described Obi as someone he believes so much in is Nigeria alongside his family and will tour some selected tourist sites including castles where slaves were kept. This will expose him to Nigeria and African history and culture.”  The blog post was shared on a Facebook page, and it has garnered more than 1, 400 reactions, 222 comments and 28 shares as of press time. DUBAWA’s first attempt was to conduct a Google search to verify if Mr Harvey was in Nigeria. But there was no report about him ever being in Nigeria on any credible media platform. Also, no credible media organisation reported such development. None of his verified social media accounts or affiliates made such announcements. DUBAWA further ran a check on his picture with Google Reverse Image Search, a tool that allows users to trace the origin of pictures. It was discovered that the picture was first posted on his verified Instagram page with the caption, “Switched location to ABU DHABI 🙏🏿” on March 30. Further scans on the picture revealed that Harvey’s location was at Emirate Palace Hotel, Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates, not Nigeria.

Claim: Pneumonia is caused by cold,"Sometime in December 2021, my five-month-old got sick and was diagnosed with pneumonia and the first thing that came to my mind was “cold.” Growing up, the few times I heard about pneumonia, it was always associated with cold, hence my thought.  “But I have not exposed her to cold so how come?” This was one of the many questions running through my mind so I asked the doctor why my daughter had pneumonia when she had not been exposed to cold.  The doctor after a good laugh explained pneumonia is not caused by a cold but thrives during cold seasons or environments.  While this abated the “mum guilt,” it left me with more questions, like what then causes pneumonia? and how can it be prevented, diagnosed and treated? This article will answer some of these questions and more.  Pneumonia is an infection caused by bacteria, viruses, parasites or fungi in one or both lungs.  This infection leads to inflammation in the air sacs of the lungs (alveoli). The filling of the alveoli with fluid or pus makes it difficult to breathe. There are over 30 different causes of pneumonia but they have been grouped into four types; bacterial, viral, mycoplasma and other pneumonia.  This type of pneumonia is caused by different bacteria with Streptococcus pneumoniae as the most common. This usually occurs when the body is weakened by poor nutrition, old age, impaired immunity or illness, allowing the bacteria to work their way into the lungs.  This type of pneumonia can affect all ages, but people who abuse alcohol, smoke cigarettes,  are debilitated, or have recently had surgery, or have a respiratory disease or viral infection, or have a weakened immune system are at higher risk.  This type is caused by various viruses, including the flu (influenza). It is responsible for about one-third of all pneumonia cases.  While many cases of viral pneumonia clear up on their own within a few weeks, severe cases can be life-threatening.  NOTE: You may be more likely to get bacterial pneumonia if you have viral pneumonia. This type is referred to as atypical pneumonia and has different symptoms and physical signs.   It is caused by the bacterium Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Generally, it causes mild, widespread pneumonia that affects all age groups. Others Other less common pneumonia may be caused by other infections including fungi. The symptoms of pneumonia vary depending on the type/cause.  Symptoms of bacterial pneumonia include bluish colour to lips and fingernails, confused mental state or delirium (especially in older people), cough that produces green, yellow, or bloody mucus, fever, heavy sweating, loss of appetite, low energy and extreme tiredness, rapid breathing, rapid pulse, shaking chills, sharp or stabbing chest pain that is worse with deep breathing or coughing, and shortness of breath that gets worse with activity. For viral pneumonia, early signs are the same as those of bacterial pneumonia but may be followed by headache, increasing shortness of breath, muscle pain, weakness, and worsening cough. Mycoplasma pneumonia symptoms differ and include a severe cough that may produce mucus. A person’s recent health history such as a recent surgery, a cold, or travel exposure, and extent of the illness are usually taken into consideration when diagnosing pneumonia.  Through history and physical exams, pneumonia is diagnosed. Some tests done to confirm diagnoses include chest X-ray, blood tests, sputum culture, pulse oximetry, chest CT scan, bronchoscopy, and pleural fluid culture.  No! Pneumonia can affect anyone from the young to the old but some groups are at higher risk. These groups include adults who are 65 years old and older, children below two years, people with certain medical conditions, and people that smoke.  A consultant and the head of the paediatrics department, Garki Hospital Abuja, Kayode Alabi, said pneumonia is not caused by cold.  According to him, many organisms like bacteria, viruses, and fungi are responsible for pneumonia.  “Cold is not a cause of pneumonia although people still say it’s a cause. However, it is not the cause. The only relationship cold has with pneumonia is that the common organisms causing pneumonia thrive well during the cold weather to cause cough, catarrh and sneezing.” Doctor Jeremiah Agim,  a gynaecologist and senior registrar at the National Hospital Abuja also agrees with Mr Alabi. He explained that pneumonia is an infection of the lungs caused by microorganisms like bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites. “Pneumonia is an infection of the lungs caused by microorganisms; bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites. Individuals at risk include; immunosuppressed persons ( HIV, cancer, organ transplant, steroid medication, diabetics) and at extremes of age,” he said.  He added that individuals at risk are people with low immunity, like persons with HIV or cancer, and very old persons. Our findings and experts reveal pneumonia is not caused by cold but the organisms that cause it thrive in cold environments.  This was helpful. You’ve done a wonderful job!

Claim: A Facebook page shared a video with several claims on home remedies that can help with an unwanted pregnancy.,"Reproduction is a crucial part of the perennial existence of humans on earth. It is a process that allows women to get pregnant and give birth to a child for the continual inhabitation of the earth. Some get pregnant deliberately to have a child while others get pregnant unintentionally. Unwanted pregnancy, also known as unintended pregnancy, is described by the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention as a pregnancy that occurred when no more children were desired or mistimed when it occurred earlier than desired. United Nations Sexual and Reproductive Health Agency revealed that nearly half of all pregnancies, totalling 121 million each year throughout the world, are unintended. Millions of people all over the world resort yearly to abortion of unintended pregnancies.  Recently, a Facebook page, Akash Kumar, shared a video listing some home remedies for unwanted pregnancy. This video attracted over 150 comments, 200,000 views, and more than 200 shares. A Facebook user, Sunita Padayachee commented, “Recipes to murder an innocent life🤮🤮🤮” Another user, Blanche Michael, also disagreed with the supposed remedies and commented, “this is dangerous. People can die. Proper medical procedures should be conducted.” Meanwhile, Nahdalah Bayuga, appreciated the post. ‘Thanks very much for sharing,” she commented. Due to the safety concerns of these remedies, DUBAWA chose to fact-check this claim. We found five claims from this list and addressed them individually. Claim 1: Pineapple Juice can help with an unwanted pregnancy Our findings show that the Bromelain found in pineapple isn’t likely to affect your pregnancy. A gynaecologist also confirmed that pregnant women have reported no uterine activity while some said it causes contraction. According to Health Line, a leading health blog, Pineapple is a safe, healthy choice during pregnancy. The blog post explains that the claim that the consumption of pineapple can lead to early miscarriage is a myth and it has no scientific evidence. As noted in the video shared by Akash, the presence of bromelain in pineapple supposedly helps to get rid of unintended pregnancy.  However, Health Line explains that Bromelain, as a tablet, is not advised to be consumed by pregnant women because it can break down proteins in the body and lead to abnormal bleeding. Most importantly, it must be noted that the Bromelain found in the core of the pineapple is very little and the amount of Bromelain in a single serving of pineapple isn’t likely to affect a woman’s pregnancy. Dr Jeremiah Agim, a gynaecologist and senior registrar at the National Hospital Abuja, who spoke to DUBAWA, said there are research articles that implicate pineapple as a cause of increased uterine activity in pregnancy consequently expected to cause abortion.  He, however, noted that pregnant women have taken pineapple throughout their pregnancy and reported no uterine activity while some said it causes contraction. Claim 2: Sesame seeds with honey as an abortion remedy. Our findings show that sesame seeds and honey do not help with pregnancy abortion. There is no scientific evidence that combination of the two items helps with pregnancy abortion. A 2015 research explains that sesame seeds which are rich in omega-3, omega-6 and DHA are important for the nourishment of pregnant and lactating women at greater risk of energy malnutrition. This research, therefore, concluded that sesame seeds possess pharmaceutical, nutraceuticals and therapeutic properties, which contribute to safe pregnancy and boost postnatal growth. Dr Agim made it known that sesame seed is a common seed used for making soup in his village. “I have not heard of abortion cases from eating the soup,” he said. Very Well Family quotes Sandy Procter, PhD, a nutrition expert at Kansas State University, as saying, “Children over the age of 1 and healthy adults—including pregnant women—can ingest honey safely since their immune systems protect against whatever bacteria the honey may contain.” Claim 3: Parsley water with lemon Health Line shares that parsley tea has its health benefits, but it increases the chances of miscarriage when consumed in high doses. The organisation notes that while no data cOur findings show that although parsley may increase the chances of miscarriage, Lemon, on the other hand, does not affect pregnancy. There is insufficient evidence that the combination of parsley water with lemon can be used to abort a pregnancy.onfirms that parsley is toxic during pregnancy, some evidence suggests it may increase your risk of miscarriage. Science Alert meanwhile reported that an Argentinian woman died from trying to induce a miscarriage by inserting parsley into her vagina shortly after the nation’s Senate rejected a monumental abortion bill. WebMD also notes that pregnant women can use parsley in food amounts. However, parsley in larger medicinal amounts may be unsafe to consume during pregnancy as Parsley has been used to cause an abortion and to start menstrual flow. On lemons, Health Line mentions that lemons pack many essential vitamins, minerals, and nutrients that help support maternal health and baby development. “I have seen an article which said parsley extract cause abortion, liver, kidney and heart failure,” Dr Agim revealed. Claim 4: Aspirin tablets for abortion. Our findings reveal that the consumption of aspirin does not get rid of the pregnancy. Experts also revealed that the medication is used to prevent preeclampsia in pregnancy. In a study carried out by PubMed, it was found that the use of aspirin during pregnancy is not associated with an increased risk of miscarriage. Dr Agim questioned why anyone would want to take aspirins to get rid of pregnancy seeing it is a drug used by pregnant women with preeclampsia.  “Aspirin is used in pregnancy in women with a previous history of preeclampsia to prevent reoccurrence,” he explained. WebMD says preeclampsia can lead to eclampsia, a serious condition that is risky for mother and child and, in rare cases, causes death. “It is not clear if this causes miscarriage,” Dr Sunday Idoko at Garki hospital Abuja simply said.   He noted that Aspirin belongs to a class of drugs called NSAIDs. “Some articles do say NSAIDs cause miscarriage but Aspirin is currently used to prevent preeclampsia in pregnancy,” he clarified. Claim 5: High dose of vitamin C for abortion Our findings and expert opinions show that high vitamin C consumption does not affect pregnancy and can be consumed during pregnancy. A gynaecologist also revealed that vitamin C is a part of antenatal medication. A high dose or consumption of vitamin C to get rid of unwanted pregnancy does not work, according to Health Line.  This article notes there is no credible scientific information suggesting that vitamin C has any effect on pregnancy, implantation, or menstruation. Compass Care, an organization offering free abortion permission in New York, notes that a pregnant woman can safely consume up to 2000mg of vitamin C per day. Dr Agim noted “Vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin, that means it’s not stored in the body. The excess will be excreted in the urine. When we say high dose of vitamin C, this is about 500 mg or 1000mg.” The gynaecologist revealed that doctors give vitamin C as part of the routine antenatal medication but not at the dose of 500 mg or 1000 mg.  “Even if it can cause abortion, I have not come across a research paper with such claim,” he said. Dr Idoko also simply said that vitamin C does not work like that. “It is safe in all trimesters and helps in folic acid absorption,” he noted. Dr Idoko explained that, from his knowledge and experience, the methods listed above are not taught in schools as methods of terminating pregnancies. He posited that “medications that are used for pregnancy termination are those with evidence.” Mifepristone, misoprostol, and mifepristone+misoprostol top the list of such evidence-based methods, according to Dr Idoko.  “People may try to make a case for unorthodox methods. These are not evidence-based and as such not accepted by everyone. Some of the events are unrelated or happened coincidentally,” Dr Idoko noted. Dr Agim mentioned that abortion is not allowed in Nigeria except when the pregnancy threatens the life of the mother. He, however, noted that Nigeria ratified the Maputo protocol in 2004.  This protocol urges the ratifying states to allow abortion in certain circumstances that include cases of rape, incest and life-threatening pregnancy.  “Women with unwanted pregnancies arising from the aforementioned situations should go to the hospital if they want abortion to avoid the complications of unsafe abortion,” he advised. Dr Ruth Lathi, a professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at Stanford University School of Medicine, said while speaking to AP News that “there’s no home remedy to induce an abortion or to cause an abortion to happen.” Our findings show that two of the Facebook claims are false, while three are misleading.

Claim: A viral video claims that Atiku is the owner of a skyscraper located in the United Arab Emirates.,"Claim: A viral video claims that Atiku is the owner of a skyscraper located in the United Arab Emirates. The claim is false. DUBAWA’s findings revealed that the building belongs to Tiger Group, a UAE-based real estate development firm. It has nothing to do with the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate. Recently, a video was circulated on social media with the claim that a building located in the United Arab Emirates belongs to Atiku Abubakar, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate. The short video shows a tall structure with a female voice-over in the background making the following allegations: “The building you see here in Dubai belongs to Atiku Abubakar but the sad reality is that no Nigerian is employed in any of the buildings doing anything.  Of course we can now understand Obasanjo when he said that the money Atiku looted can feed 400 million Nigerians for 400 years. We cannot be fooled more than once. Be wise, Nigerians.” The video has been widely shared across social media platforms and blogs, suggesting to users that the information is correct. Therefore, DUBAWA opted to verify the accuracy of the claim. DUBAWA conducted a Google keyword search to see if Mr Abubakar owns any skyscraper in Dubai. With no clear result, we resorted to making a reverse image search; however, that was also futile. We further scan-searched a fragment of the video with Google Lense, a tool that allows users to scan and search what is seen on the surface of pictures. This provided the exact location and picture of the building at 898M+QW5 – Al Majaz – Al Nahdha – Sharjah – United Arab Emirates. The building is beside Kitcherama Group, a kitchen supply store.  A description on Google maps revealed that the property belongs to Tiger Group, a real estate development company in the UAE with over 200 completed projects. The company is headed by “Eng. Waleed Mohammad AlZoubi.” In addition to our findings, information on Google maps shows that this building is located in Sharjah and not Dubai as claimed. Sharjah is one of the seven emirates that constitute the United Arab Emirates. Our findings have revealed that the property belongs to Tiger Group and has nothing to do with Atiku Abubakar. Therefore, the claim is false. ",FALSE,14/09/2022,https://dubawa.org/property-in-uae-not-owned-by-atiku-as-claimed-in-viral-video/
"On September 1, the head of the Nigerian Customs accused the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited of incorrect daily petroleum consumption figures. The bone of contention was the daily consumption figures and the corresponding rising subsidy bill. There also might have been a merry-go-round about who is to blame for oil theft but the subsidy bill and daily consumption figures were front and centre.","On September 1, the head of the Nigerian Customs accused the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited of incorrect daily petroleum consumption figures. The bone of contention was the daily consumption figures and the corresponding rising subsidy bill. There also might have been a merry-go-round about who is to blame for oil theft but the subsidy bill and daily consumption figures were front and centre. The Customs boss, Hameed Ali, was quoted as saying; “I remember that last year we spoke about this (subsidy). Unfortunately, this year, we are talking about subsidies again. The over N11 trillion we are going to take as debt, more than half of it is going for subsidy. The issue is not about the smuggling of petroleum products. I have always argued this with NNPC,” If we are consuming 60 million litres of PMS per day, why would you allow the release of 98 million litres per day? If you know this is our planned consumption, why would you allow that release?” the Customs boss said. In reaction, the NNPCL defended the daily petroleum consumption figures, insisting that daily consumption of Premium Motor Spirit, popularly called petrol, across the country was 68 million as against Customs’ claim of 60 million and even offered to submit itself for forensic audit of its PMS supply and subsidy management. The Oil Company went on to state that ‘N297 was spent per litre’ on petroleum subsidy between January and August 2022. And then stated that without subsidy fuel pump price will be N462/litre.   Naturally, this kind of news further drives up anxiety and leads to speculations among Nigerians who are already dealing with high costs of everything. It might reinforce fear among citizens on the removal of subsidies.  Arguments, counter arguments and speculations aside, will the pump price for petrol really be N462/litre without subsidy?  How factual are the claims by NNPC about subsidy per litre, and how much it will cost to subsidise at either the widely circulated 60 million or 68 million consumption figures? CLAIM ONE: NNPC paid subsidy of N297 per litre on 68 million litres of petrol daily from January to August, 2022 VERDICT: N297 as the average figure spent per litre of petroleum  is INACCURATE  According to reports by many media houses, Garbadeen Muhammad, the official spokesperson of the NNPCL issued a statement stating that the average figure spent on subsidy per day in the country is N297/litre. While it’s unclear how NNPC arrived at the figure, in its FAAC report for August 2022, the NNPC stated that it spent a total of N2.458 trillion as subsidy payment from January to August 2022.  Dataphyte’s review shows that the amount paid as subsidy per litre of petroleum varied between N99-N210 in the eight months under review, with a daily consumption of 68 million litres and at no time did the NNPC pay N297 to subsidise a litre of petroleum. Further review shows that the average amount paid in the eight months for each litre of petroleum consumed stands at N149.935 as against the widely reported N297. Even if the  daily consumption stood at 60 million litres as claimed by the Nigerian Customs, the average amount spent on each litre of petroleum would still not have amounted to N297. The claim of N297 per litre of petroleum is not plausible given that, if that is the amount spent on subsidising each litre of petroleum in the eight months under review, Nigeria would have spent more than the N2.485 trillion it spent on subsidy in the period under review. With the 68 million daily consumption figure quoted by the NNPCL and following the eight months trend, the country may only need to spend N3.721 trillion on subsidy for the entirety of 2022, as against the N6.5 trillion the NNPCL is demanding for subsidy payments for the year.  Even if the consumption figure were to be 60 million litres daily, the country, based on the eight months trend, will still only spend N3.721 trillion on petroleum subsidy. CLAIM TWO: The NNPC stated that the combination of cost elements translates to a retail pump price of N462/litre Verdict: The Claim is FALSE Now will fuel sell for N462/litre without subsidy as the NNPCL has said? Analysis of subsidy costs per litre of petrol shows that without subsidy, fuel prices would have ranged between N264-N377 between January and August and would not have reached the N462/litre as has been said. How much would petroleum cost each month between January and August without subsidy? See the chart below. Could fuel prices reach N462/litre before the end of the year? Crude oil prices have fallen since it rose to a high of $122.7/ barrel in June, if it continues to fall or does not rise beyond the June high point, it is unlikely that the price of petroleum per litre will rise to N462/litre in 2022. CLAIM THREE: The country Consumes 68 million Litres Daily Verdict: The Claim is Questionable The NNPCL has maintained that the average daily consumption figures from January to August is 68 million litres. The review shows, however, that the company’s claim should be questioned at the least. Why? Considering that there was severe fuel scarcity in the first four months of the year with long queues and a thriving black market where fuel went as high as N550/ltr, it is impossible that actual consumption would not have been affected. Scarcity signals the absence of a product, and with petroleum subsidies based on actual consumption, it is unclear how the consumption rate was not affected when people could not buy/consume petroleum. Based on the subsidy figure made available by the NNPC in its monthly FAAC report and further analysis done by Dataphyte, the daily consumption ranged from 45.263 million litres daily to 96.554 million litres daily between January and August, 2022.  The 68 million litres ‘daily consumption’ credited to NNPC is the daily average for the eight months and not a real time, per day consumption for each month. Thus, Nigeria’s daily consumption does not stand at 68 million litres but rather ranges per time based on demand. As controversy continues over Nigeria’s subsidy expenditure, there are continued concerns over its sustainability, especially in relation to impacts on the revenue available for economic growth and development.

Claim: A video of a child in a washing tub being beaten to the ground by a woman occurred in Sierra Leone.,"A viral video has been circulating on social media platforms in Sierra Leone showing a disturbing video of a woman mercilessly beating up a young child to the ground from a bathing tub. The level of meanness in the video has enraged many on social media.  Social media users in Sierra Leone have been debating the location of the incident, with many claiming it happened somewhere in the country whilst a few others deny it was shot in the country. A couple of people reached out to DUBAWA, asking that we verify if indeed the video was shot in Sierra Leone.   DUBAWA heeding the request to do a quick verification on the viral video investigated the claim and asked for more detail on the matter from the people who shared the claim with us. In order to verify the video and its location, DUBAWA employed the InVID tool, which helps to verify videos by analyzing their content and also providing keyframes to further conduct a reverse image search. This tool provided several key frames of the video in question and went ahead to do a reverse image search where the full story behind the claim and the video was laid bare. We were able to identify the woman as Nabulime Dorothy and the assaulted child was her two years old daughter.  The slippers flogging incident occurred in Uganda and the Ugandan Criminal Investigation Directorate tweeted about the incident and the arrest of the mother in these words:  “The @PoliceUG has today arrested Nabulime Dorothy who is seen in the viral clip circulating on social media assaulting her 2 years old daughter. She will be produced in court on Monday to answer for her actions.” The INVID tool clearly shows the location of the video and the time it happened.  Further investigations by DUBAWA on Twitter show multiple tweets of the arrested 22 years-old mother, Nabulime Dorothy, now in Police custody and set to appear in court on Monday, September 5, 2022, for torture with aggravation charges. The trending video of the two-year-old child beaten by her mother with a pair of slippers has been verified through the video verifying tools at our disposal at DUBAWA. And the evidence is clear that the incident in the video did not happen in Sierra Leone but in Uganda, East Africa.

"Claim: The Sierra Leone Police (SLP) published a list of wanted suspects accused of masterminding the deadly demonstration on August 10, 2022. One of the suspects is ‘DaGrin’ who they claim was a Sierra Leonean.","Sierra Leone has made the headlines for all the wrong reasons. What ought to have been a peaceful demonstration on August 10, 2022 turned violent with over 20 people including security personnel losing their lives.  There is a raging controversy over who the organisers of the demonstration are, even though government sources accuse opposition elements as being the masterminds of the violent demonstration. The Sierra Leone president, Julius Maada Bio, as well as the security forces have vowed to investigate the cause of the violent demonstration in order to punish the perpetrators. A 15-member Committee has been constituted by the government to investigate the violence. Even before the Committee was constituted, the Sierra Leone police had begun its own investigation to unravel the people behind the violent demonstration.  In line with that, a list of wanted persons accused of masterminding the August 10 violence has popped up. The list which has pictures of the wanted persons came with the Sierra Leone Police logo planted at the top edges and a claim that all the persons captured in the banner were Sierra Leoneans. Below the banner were contact numbers purported to be that of the police and a 3,000 Nle reward to all persons who may divulge information that can lead to the arrest of any of the persons in the picture. However, one of the pictures in the banner, believed to be that of Olaonipekun Oladapo Olaitan,  a Nigerian Hip-hop artiste with the stage name DaGrin, has triggered a bigger controversy.  A social media blogger in Sierra Leone popularly called King Cross published the picture on his blog with a caption: “The Sierra Leone Police has released a list of wanted people who are alleged to be part of the protest that turned into a riot resulting in the deaths of several people and destruction of properties. “Among the Wanted people is the late Nigerian singer DAGRIN who sadly passed away 12 years ago. We want to apologise in advance to Nigeria for any inconvenience this information may cause as our Inspector General is getting familiar to his new job.”  Other bloggers posted the same on their blogs with similar queries as can be seen here. DUBAWA took special interest in this claim because it borders on the security of the nation and about a demonstration that has already taken the lives of over 20 people, some of whom include security officials. And with the picture of DaGrin in the list of wanted persons, the police’s claim had taken a different twist.   In verifying this claim, therefore, DUBAWA first had to establish whether or not the banner emanated from the police. This researcher had to go to the Lumley and Kissy Police Stations where the picture-banners had been posted to confirm if indeed it was coming from the police. Officers at the stations refused to speak on record to the researcher. Later, DUBAWA called one of the contacts provided on the banner which was picked by an officer, who hung up immediately the issue of DaGrin was raised by the researcher. Several attempts to call back have proven futile. But one thing is certain; the banner was indeed published by the police.  Having confirmed the source of the banner, DUBAWA decided to scrutinise the pictures, especially that of DaGrin.  In the investigation, DUBAWA found that several news portals have used the photo of DaGrin depicting that the artiste was a Nigerian who died from complications arising from injuries sustained in a ghastly motor accident when he ran into a stationary truck in Lagos in 2010. DUBAWA further conducted a TinEye reverse image search on the photo. We found a post on modernghana, a news website in Ghana, to have attached the picture to its news story published on May 15, 2010. We also found an Instagram account with the handle @dagrin_official. The description of the account indicated that it is the unofficial account of the artist. In its feed, the picture with the Nigerian artiste having a gun around his neck was posted. This was on July 30, 2014, four years after his demise. Even though there is little evidence of the exact location of the photo, several news sources indicate that he is a Nigerian artiste and could not have been a Sierra Leonean.   The evidence also suggests Dagrin died in 2010 and could not have been part of a plot to destabilise Sierra Leone in 2022.  What are Nigerians saying? DUBAWA further got in touch with a music critic in Nigeria by name Emmanuel Daraloye to find out more about DaGrin.  “Dagrin was a Yoruba rapper who spotlighted the Yoruba rap scene in the 2010s. He was the front runner for the likes of Olamide, CDQ and other rappers that came after him,” Daraloye described the rapper’s craft. “He died on April 22, 2010, at the Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH) after a ghastly accident,” he also confirmed news about the rapper’s death. He was surprised to have seen DaGrin’s picture on the list of wanted persons for a crime committed on August 10, 2022, 12 years after the rapper’s demise, and wanted the Sierra Leonean police to “pay more attention to detail.” DUBAWA also contacted an official in the Sierra Leone Music Industry by name of Bockarie Mattia to check if the late artist had anything to with Sierra Leone before his demise. According to him, there is no record to show that DaGrin ever came to Sierra Leone to perform or had any other business in Sierra Leone. He was quick to add though that DaGrin was quite popular in Nigeria whose fame shot up in 2008 only to be cut shot in 2012.. Olaonipekun Oladapo Olaitan aka (Dagrin) was born on October 15, 1987 in Ogun State in the Federal Republic of Nigeria. DaGrin was a Hip-Hop artist with numerous accolades to his name.  He was among the few artists in Nigeria who sang his songs in his native language other than the well-known “Nigerian-Pidgin English” which is widely spoken in the country. He was known to be one of the prolific artists in his time who had songs or collaborations with artists such as D. J Neptune, M.I, Frenzy, 9ice, Konga etc.  DUBAWA also found out that DaGrin’s album won the best hip hop World Award 2010 – an award that was organised by the Nigerian Entertainment Awards( NEA).  The artist had a galaxy of songs to his name, but the famous ones or the ones that got the attention of the music industry were 50 tracks, which include: “If I Die; Kondo; DaGrinponPon Pon (Instrumental); Hola-Hola; Swag; Ghetto Dream; Da Grin – If I Die; Idi Nla; Kekere, and a host of other beautiful songs. Few among his collaborations are: “My Pain (Part 2) ft. Dude Tetsola; Bigiano ft. Omawumi – Thank God; Mo ti Gboro ft. Isolate etc. DaGrin met his untimely death in a road accident on April 14, 2010, along the Agege Motor Road, in Mushin, Lagos State.  DUBAWA again reached out to the Head of the Sierra Leone Police Media, Supt. Brima Kamara, to ask him how a man who died 12 years ago found his way into the Sierra Leonean police’s wanted list for a crime committed in August 2022. Supt. Kamara would not explain how except to say he is not much involved in policing because “I’m out on exams.”   Screenshot of a WhatsApp Chat with the SLP Spokesperson  According to the structure of communication in the  Sierra Leone police,  no police officer can speak to the media or on happenings around the Sierra Leone Police except the Head of Communications.  DUBAWA’s investigation shows that one of the pictures posted in the list of wanted persons is Olaonipekun Oladapo Olaitan, a deceased Nigerian hip-hop artist who died 12 years ago in a ghastly accident and could not have been part of the plot to cause mayhem in a demonstration that took place in 2022.

"Claim: The Vice Presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress, Kashim Shettima, claims that Lagos State is the third largest economy in Africa.","At the 2022 Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) Annual General Conference, some presidential candidates addressed Nigerians on key issues on Monday, August 22, 2022. Candidates of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, Labour Congress (LP), Peter Obi and Kashim Shettima, the vice presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), headlined the event. Mr Kashim represented Mr Tinubu at the conference where the candidates presented some of their plans should they be elected. During his speech, Mr Shettima made a claim that Lagos is the third largest economy in Africa.  “When Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu became the governor of Lagos State in 1999, there was only one ambulance in the service of Lagos State. Lagos was earning a measly sum of 700 million every month as internally generated revenue. Now, Lagos is earning 51 billion as its internally generated revenue. Lagos is the third largest economy in Africa,” the former Borno State governor said. The importance of this claim and its potential effect on voters’ decisions prompted DUBAWA to verify this claim.  DUBAWA carried out a keyword search and sought available statistics to verify this claim.  In 2017, the former Lagos State governor, Akinwunmi Ambode, said that Lagos State would be the third largest economy in Africa by 2020. According to the World Economic Outlook database, Africa’s largest economies are Nigeria, South Africa, and Egypt. This was also reported by Statistics Times.  According to the report, these three countries make up nearly half of Africa’s economy. Egypt’s GDP is more than twice Algeria’s GDP, which is ranked fourth. The smallest economy in Africa is that of Sao Tomé and Principe. Statista Global Business Cities index of 2022 also has Egypt’s Cairo as the top business city in the whole of Africa, with Lagos City coming a distant eight in the ranking. The above ranking was achieved by evaluating economically relevant cities from around the world based on the most pertinent data for decisions at the corporate level. Also, indices like population size and GDP play an important role in determining the extent to which a city is suitable as a business location. Statista also revealed that Nigeria has the biggest GDP in Africa in 2021, with 441.5 billion dollars. South Africa, meanwhile, had the second-highest GDP on the continent, at 418 billion dollars. Notably, two other North African nations, Algeria and Morocco, followed Egypt, the third-largest economy on the list of largest economies in Africa. The Lagos State Ministry of Economic Planning and Budgetary (MEPB), in its publication covering 2013 to 2021, revealed that Lagos State ranks fourth on the 2020 list of African richest economies using the Gross Domestic Products (GDP) calculation. The ranking has Cairo, Johannesburg, and Cape Town as the first, second and third cities, respectively. Contrary to the claim, Lagos State is not the third largest economy in Africa, but Nigeria is the largest economy in Africa. Also, Lagos is number eight on the Statista chart showing the top business cities in Africa. We, however, reached out to Mr Shettima and his personal assistant, Ahmed Ningi, to ask for his primary source of the claim, but all efforts proved abortive. Our findings show Lagos is not the third largest economy in Africa, and neither is it in the top three business cities in Africa.

Claim: A Facebook user claims babies can be grown in a bag.,"About 15 million babies are born preterm (too early) every year and approximately one million children die each year due to complications from premature birth.  Preterm birth complications, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO), are the leading cause of death among children under five years.  A Facebook user, Chief Yuma, shared a post with the claim that babies can be grown in bags. He claimed the technology has been used for many years. “In the near future women will no longer have to carry their own baby through pregnancy. It can be grown in a bag. According to whistle blisters this technology has been used for many years,” part of the post reads.  Public health continues to be a major target for misinformation and it is important the right information is consumed by the public who make decisions daily regarding their health. We conducted a keyword search which led to the concept of ectogenesis, a process of growing a baby outside the womb.  A form of this is what we have today as incubation, also known as partial ectogenesis. This happens when babies are transferred into an incubator in a neonatal ward to continue development. Our research shows a team of researchers at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia developed what is called a Biobag. This Biobag, developed to gestate sheep foetuses, replaces the placenta with an oxygenator plugged into a lamb’s umbilical cord. The bag is filled with an amniotic fluid replacement with which the lamb breathes and swallows. This YouTube video on “recreating the womb: new hope for premature babies” shared five years ago by the hospital explains this process. It was, however, noted that this has only been done for lambs and not for humans. Following this feat, there have been efforts to create this Biobag or artificial womb for humans to help preterm babies. This 2020 article by the Guardian looked at the possibility of artificial wombs being the future for human pregnancy but so far, this is only a method that has not been carried out on humans.  It is also important to note that this Biobag for lambs is not a substitute for pregnancy as the lamb was transferred from the womb of its mother. A paediatrician at Cedar Crest Hospital Abuja, Alabi Olukayode, dismissed this as a long-standing speculation. “I don’t think it is true, mere speculation. I have heard of these stories before I entered medical school. Though I didn’t bother to verify it, with the knowledge acquired, it turned out to be False,” he said. Jeremiah Agim, a gynaecologist and senior registrar at the National Hospital Abuja, said he is not aware of such technology.  “I have no idea about this. If he means cloning then it’s a different thing altogether,” he said.  Another gynaecologist, Sunday Idoko, said he is aware of test tube babies but not this technology.  “In all honesty,I am just finding out about this technology. But it may be possible. In medicine, we never say never “But we have had test tube babies etc in the past. This is simply the IVF we hear about. But here, the fertilisation takes place outside and implementation takes place in a human,” he added.  Babies cannot be grown in a bag as our findings show the Biobag designed to help preterm babies survive has only been carried out on lambs. While there are efforts to recreate this for humans, whether babies can be grown in this bag or any other type of bag is subject to further research and experimentation.

Claim: A viral WhatsApp message and image links HIV to COVID-19 and smallpox vaccines,"The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is an infection that attacks the body’s immune system, specifically the white blood cells called CD4.  It can be transmitted through contact with infected blood, semen or vaginal fluids, and causes Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). HIV continues to be a major global public health concern as it has claimed more than 35 million lives. Recently, a viral WhatsApp message claims the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) has admitted to HIV being part of the COVID-19 vaccine.  “The BBC has now admitted that the HIV was in some of the Covid vaccines,” part of the message read.  The message which contains a link suggests this is the reason countries are reporting a rise in HIV infection.  Another viral image alleged that The Times report claimed the WHO injected Africans with over 50 million smallpox vaccines in 1987 which triggered AIDS.  Seeing how fast this information has spread and based on requests for verification, DUBAWA decided to verify these claims.  Claim 1: COVID-19 vaccines contain the HIV The link contained in this WhatsApp message led to a website, praguetruth.cz  which contained the same claim referencing an article published in the American Journal of Managed Care (AJMC) in 2020. Going through the article on AJMC, we discovered the original story on HIV and Adenovirus type-5 vaccine COVID-19 vaccine has been updated.  This new update showed that all authorised vaccines are safe and effective.  Full Fact also clarified that the potential vaccine with HIV protein (the basis for the original version of this report) was never rolled out.  To ascertain if there are reported new cases of HIV, DUBAWA conducted a keyword search. We found no news report on a surge in cases of HIV.  A website (hiv.gov) that provides timely and relevant federal HIV policies, programs and resources in the United States (US) reveals an estimated 1.5 million individuals worldwide acquired HIV in 2021. According to their data, this number marked a 32% decline in new HIV infections since 2010 contrary to the claim on surges in HIV.  We also found that this claim and similar ones which have been debunked by Reuters here and here originated from this BBC report that highlighted how an Australian vaccine was abandoned over a false HIV response.  Viral Facts Africa in its videos here and here have also dismissed claims linking the COVID-19 vaccine and HIV. The Infomedic Manager for the WHO Africa Infodemic Response Alliance (AIRA), Sergio Cecchini, dismissed this claim as false.   “The claim that HIV virus was included in COVID-19 vaccines is false. There have been several rumours including that COVID-19 vaccines were causing HIV infections.” Claim 2: smallpox vaccine by WHO caused a wave of AIDS infection.  Our research shows there is no link between AIDS infection and the Smallpox vaccine. We also found a fact-check by Full Fact also debunking this.  Mr Sergio of the WHO alliance also said this claim is old and has been debunked, making reference to the verification by Full Fact highlighted above.  “This very old false claim about WHO infecting 50M people has been deeply debunked by FullFact here”.  Our findings show these claims are baseless and therefore false.  ",FALSE,26/08/2022,https://dubawa.org/recurring-conspiracy-theory-claims-covid-19-vaccines-infect-users-with-hiv/
Claim: A Twitter user claims youth in Adamawa State burnt brooms to show their support for Atiku Abubakar.,"Claim: A Twitter user claims youth in Adamawa State burnt brooms to show their support for Atiku Abubakar. DUBAWA discovered that the video was taken during Bugum Chugu, a fire festival that takes place in Ghana. It is neither related to Nigeria, nor has anything to do with the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate. As the 2023 presidential election draws near, the Nigerian social media landscape has been awash with discussions around the major contending candidates. Recently, some social media users began to circulate a TikTok video suggesting that the youths of Adamawa State are out to show their support for the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar. “Millions of youths burning brooms in Adamawa after receiving Atiku yesterday, well, this is just the beginning. 2023 is going to be mad. #AtikuKawai,” one of the tweets reads.  The video shows a crowd, matching on the street with fire sticks in their hands as loud music blasts in the background. The video has confused social media users. While some believed it was Adamawa youth burning brooms in support of the PDP presidential candidate, others claimed that the video was from Ghana.  Therefore, DUBAWA opted to verify the accuracy of the video. After close observation of the video, DUBAWA found two overlapping usernames. Although blurry, they were two different user identities.  TikTok is known for automatically attaching its users’ names to their videos. However, the original version of a TikTok video is not supposed to have more than one username, indicating a form of manipulation on the video.  When DUBAWA conducted a keyword search on TikTok, similar videos shared by other users were uncovered.   The earliest version of the footage revealed it was taken during a Ghanaian festival that took place on the 9th of August, 2022. This is contrary to the circulating version. In the original version, emphasis was the cheers of the crowd in the background and not music. Also, the people were waving a bunch of thatch lighted with fire and not brooms as claimed.  The Bugum Chugu Fire Festival is an annual event that takes place in the Northern region of Ghana. The occasion is marked by the “lighting of thatch torches, matching along approved routes, chanting war songs.  The event is marked to celebrate the beginning of a new year in the traditional month of Bugum Gɔri, known among the Dagomba people as ‘Ʒiɛm’.” According to legend, the people upheld this event many years ago, after a missing son of their king was found asleep under a tree. Our discovery shows that the circulating video emanated from an annual fire festival that took place in the Northern region of Ghana. It is not related to Nigeria or the PDP presidential candidate. The claim accompanying the video is false. ",FALSE,26/08/2022,https://dubawa.org/video-shot-in-ghana-used-to-depict-support-for-atiku/
Claim: “The government through the Central Bank of (CBL) has minted coins in the L$25 and L$30 denominations” according to a Facebook user.,"It seems that Liberia is returning to the pre-war era where Liberians used coins for business transactions and as legal tender. In 1847 and 1862, copper 1 and 2 cents coins were issued and were the only Liberian coins until 1896, when a full coinage consisting of 1, 2, 10, 25 and 50 cents coins were introduced. The last issues were made in 1906. In accordance with Article 34(d) of the Liberian constitution, the Liberian legislature mandated the Central Bank of Liberia to print new currency and mint coins in the country. Article 34(d) states that the legislature shall have the power, among other things, “to levy taxes, duties, imports, exercise and other revenues, to borrow money, issue currency, mint coins, and to make appropriations for the fiscal governance of the Republic.”  It is upon this reliance, the Liberian legislature, on May 6, 2021, signed and issued a joint resolution (Resolution #001/2021) authorizing the Central Bank of Liberia to print and mint the new family of Liberian currency to the tone of L$48 billion  The legislature’s decision was informed by the Counsel from the Economic Management Team (EMT) of the country falling shortages of Liberian dollar notes on the market. There is also a huge quantity of mutilated banknotes and the scarcity of smaller denominations like L$5, L$10 and L$20 Liberian banknotes on the market.  This new currency is expected to be printed and minted within a three-year period beginning in 2021, 2022 and 2024. The year  2023 was skipped because, according to the legislature, it is the election year. There have been occasions where taxi drivers, tricycles (kehkeh), and motorbike riders and passengers get into confrontations over lack of change or when there is disagreement over mutilated currency as change or transport fares.    It is to solve these challenges that the Liberia Legislature in March of 2021, granted authorization to the CBL for the printing and minting of new family of Liberian currency.  Following the authorization, the CBL, in December of 2021 printed and brought into the country the first consignment of newly printed Liberian dollar banknotes so as to help ease the problems during the festive season CBL.  Despite the coming of the first batch of the newly printed Liberian dollars in the country, the problem of shortages of smaller denominations and mutilated money still persisted because the CBL had only printed notes in higher denominations, including one hundred Liberian dollars here CBL. Despite the chronology of the events, there has been news of the arrival of the new family of banknotes and minted coins in the country with some Liberians taking to their social media (Facebook) pages with claims of what they believe is the image of the newly minted coins.  Among the many posts on social media (Facebook) was  Liberia’s famous social media giant based in Canada, Varney A Teah who goes by the Facebook name “Strong Gbana Pekin.”  This post by Strong Gbana Pekin generated over 250 comments, 13 shares and over 270 emojis. Here are some comments under this post: Diophine Kimirah Goodridge  Due to the seriousness of the currency situation in the country, DUBAWA embarked on an investigative venture to ascertain the facts surrounding the various posts flooding social media (Facebook) in recent times as can be seen here and here. DUBAWA first decided to look at the authorization granted the CBL to print banknotes and mint coins, by the Liberian Legislature “Resolution #001/2021” and resolution is found on page 18 and 19 of the CBL annual report 2021. DUBAWA went further by contacting one of the officials at the CBL Atty. Alphonso Zeon to provide explanation for the various claims on Facebook about the new 30 Liberian dollars and 25 Liberian dollars minted coins. Mr. Alponson Zeon insisted there were no 30 or 25 Liberian dollar minted coins as can be seen in the WhatsApp conversation below.  DUBAWA also contacted the Head of Communication at the CBL, Mr. Cyrus Wleh Badio, who told us that the various claims on Facebook are false. Mr. Cyrus Wleh Badio indicated that the news trending on Facebook about the bank minting 25 and 30 Liberian dollars coins are fabricated and far from the truth as can be seen again in the WhatsApp conversation below. A release has, however, been issued by the Ministry of Information Cultural Affairs & Tourism (MICAT) clarifying the numerous Facebook posts.  This statement was also published on the government run media outlet, The New Liber Newspaper as well as on Liberia Ministry of Information Facebook page. Investigation by DUBAWA into social media (Facebook) posts suggests that speculations that the CBL has minted L$25 and L$30 coins are false. The CBL has clarified that it has only minted L$5 and L$10 in coins contrary to the many Facebook posts.

"Claim: A TikTok video, which has been widely circulated on social media, suggests that some Ghanaian police confiscated ransom money being smuggled into the country by Nigerian kidnappers.","In Nigeria, terror gangs, popularly called bandits, kidnap people for ransom. Demand for ransom is now on the rise and has become an illicit, but lucrative business for terrorists across Nigeria. Leveraging on this, some social media users have started circulating a TikTok video to suggest that Ghaninan police seized the ransom money being smuggled into the country by Nigerian kidnappers.  The TikTok video was captioned, “Ghana police intercepted billions of naira being  smuggled out of Nigeria by bandits.” In a close observation of the video, DUBAWA discovers that there were several crates, containing what looked like bank notes, scattered on a road. A blue van and white fuel tanker were also visible in the video, as well as armed security officials.  When DUBAWA read through the comments, it was discovered that there was confusion among social media users. While some believe the video has something to do with Nigeria, some queried the source of the video.  To avoid further confusion, and to set the record straight, DUBAWA decides to check the accuracy of the video being circulated.  DUBAWA conducted a frame-by-frame analysis of the video on the InVid Video verification tool.  Results from the analysis show that the earliest version of the video was uploaded on a YouTube channel called Chasm TV on 5th October 2019. The earliest version of the video was captioned: “Money scattered after Bank of Ghana bullion van collided with a tanker.”  Going through the 29-second video, DUBAWA observed that the video was identical to the one being circulated to portray the confiscation of ransom money by Nigerian kidnappers. Keywords like “Ghana bullion van collided with a tanker” took DUBAWA to a report published by Ghanaian media on the crash. Media organizations, like Joy Online, Pulse Ghana, and Within Nigeria also published the crash.  The report which was captioned: “Cash flows after BoG bullion van collides with fuel tanker; one confirmed dead (video),” explained that the video showed a collision on Techiman-Kumasi road in Ghana,  involving a Bank of Ghana bullion van and a fuel tanker.  According to the report, the crash which took place on 4th September 2019 led to the death of one person, while several others sustained serious injuries.  The report partly reads, “A joint team of the Military, Police, Fire Service, Immigration and the Bureau of National Investigation (BNI) cordoned off the crash scene and collected the scattered money into various security vehicles. Monies from the scene of the crash will be kept at the Police Divisional Headquarters cells under the guard of the Military, Police and Bank of Ghana security officers.”  The TikTok video suggesting that some Ghanaian police confiscated ransom money being smuggled into the country by Nigerian kidnappers is misleading. DUBAWA discovered that the video was taken in 2019 in Ghana during a collision on Techiman-Kumasi road involving a Bank of Ghana bullion van and a fuel tanker.  The video has nothing to do with Nigerian kidnappers.  Sarfo ",MISLEADING,17/08/2022,https://dubawa.org/this-is-not-a-video-of-nigerian-kidnappers-smuggling-ransom-money-into-ghana/
Claim:  Twitter user claims that God struck Boko Haram with lightning while on their way to Niger (Nigeria) to destroy “Biafrans.”,"A Twitter user, Dr Ken (@DrKen43273749), claims that God has struck Boko Haram insurgents with lightning whilst on their way to Nigeria to attack Biafrans. The user attached the narrative with a horrifying image showing a considerable number of charred bodies lying on the ground and made visible to onlookers.  “The God of our land will always destroy them. Boko Haram terrorist trying to enter Niger to come and destroy Biafrans, but God strike them with lightning,” the user stated.   Biafra was a state constructed by secessionists in Southeast Nigeria after some Igbo military leaders unilaterally declared their independence from Nigeria in May 1967. It constituted the former Eastern Region of Nigeria and was inhabited principally by Igbo people.  Biafra ceased to exist as an independent state in January 1970. However, the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) was founded in 2012 by Nnamdi Kanu, to restore the independent state of Biafra. Boko Haram  is also popularly known in Nigerian and Western media as “Boko Haram,” which means “Western education is forbidden.” Since its inception in 2009, the group has wreaked havoc on the country, causing the deaths and displacement of many civilians, especially in the north-eastern part of the country. The alleged claim has garnered some traction on social media, particularly on Twitter, insinuating that Boko Haram’s plan to attack Biafra (Igbos in the south-east) was intercepted by God.   One user, Taffy Ebuka (@Taffyebuka), even commented that a similar incident had happened before but was equally intercepted.  “It’s always happening to them anytime they try to invade our land, last time it was an accident, today it was on fire 😂 Boko Fulani you can’t win us and your time is up, 2023 is our turn.” Nigeria is currently facing problems of insecurity and with diverse news of tension around the country,  such claims are capable of inciting unrest and fear amongst the populace.  A Google reverse image search conducted on the image traced it to a Reddit post in 2019 about a tanker explosion incident in Tanzania that killed over 70 persons.  Similarly, the image was also featured on Media Brest and Spy Uganda, when a crashed tanker exploded and killed at least 62 people who were trying to syphon off the fuel in the Tanzanian town of Morogoro.  In a news report by CNN and other news media outlets, the incident was confirmed to have taken place. In fact,  The Tanzanian police described the unfortunate circumstance as one of the worst tragedies of its kind to befall the East African country. Aside from victims that lost their lives in the incident, the Tanzanian state broadcaster KBC, citing police figures, said at least 70 other people were injured during the explosion in the town of Morogoro, about 120 miles west of the economic hub of Dar es Salaam, the capital. Furthermore, in one report by Daily Express on the incident, a picture was featured that captured a Tanzanian policeman standing at the scene of the accident. Concurrently, the same policeman also appeared in the alleged image, confirming the fact that the incident took place in Tanzania and not anywhere in Nigeria. See details in images 1 and 2 below:  Image 1 is the alleged picture shared by the claimant. Apparently, a Tanzanian police officer is seen in the background (circled in red) putting on a blue shirt and khaki trousers. Image 2 (below) is the picture used by Daily Express to report on the incident. Noticeably, the same policeman is seen in the background.   Evidently, the alleged picture has been used in different contexts to spread false narratives.  In India, the same picture was used to spread disinformation about a fire outbreak but fortunately, it was debunked in this fact-check.  This is also not the first time DUBAWA is debunking false claims related to this same fire incident in Tanzania.  In June this year, a video from the incident was falsely shared on WhatsApp alleging that bandits were roasted by lightning on their way to attack Christians in Zamfara State. The picture used to spread the information of a Boko Haram planned attack on Biafra and, by extension, the southeastern parts of Nigeria is false. The picture was originally taken in Tanzania, when a fuel tanker exploded, killing many people. ",FALSE,16/08/2022,https://dubawa.org/image-from-tanzania-falsely-used-to-depict-boko-haram-attack/
Claim: Persons with Dual Citizenship under the new dual citizenship law of Liberia are allowed to contest for Representatives and Senators.,"Liberia was founded by freed US slaves in 1847 as “a refuge and a haven for freed men of colour”. Its constitution defines black people in the language of the time, as “persons who are Negroes or of Negro descent”. For years, the issue of dual citizenship in Liberia has been a very critical topic in the country since its post-war era. This is so because, during the country’s over fourteen years of civil unrest, many Liberians fled the country for safety in other countries, particularly in Europe and the Americas and took up those countries’ citizenship for diverse reasons. The old alien and Nationality law states “A child who is a Liberia citizen by virtue of the provisions of subparagraph (b) of this section shall lose his citizenship unless he has resided in Liberia before attaining his majority or unless when he attains his majority and before attaining the age of 23 he goes before a Liberian consul and takes the oath of allegiance to the Republic of Liberia required of a petitioner for naturalization.” This law states further “(a) A person who is a Negro, or of Negro descent, born in Liberia and subject to the jurisdiction thereof. (b) A person born outside Liberia whose father (i) was born a citizen of Liberia; (ii) was a citizen of Liberia at the time of the birth of such child, and (iii) had resided in Liberia prior to the birth of such child.” Upon taking over as President of Liberia in 2018, President George Manneh Weah asserted during his first State of the Nation Address (SONA) that the Liberian constitution was racist, unnecessary and inappropriate and promised to scrap the law that prohibits foreigners from becoming citizens of the country. His position was further strengthened by a landmark case in 2019 when the Liberian Supreme Court ruled that citizenship is a right that could not be revoked without a trial. However, it is believed that some Liberians, especially the privileged, secretly carry dual passports. Notwithstanding how crucial this case was, it did not automatically grant Liberians a right to be dual citizens. There was a continued push for the new law on dual citizens with Liberians in the diaspora playing a huge role. After years of controversy including a referendum to reject the Dual Citizens law in December 2020, the country has finally agreed to a new Dual Citizens law passed in 2022. There is, however, some simmering controversy over the rights to be accorded the dual citizens of Liberia.During a radio talk show aired on a local radio station, Okay 99.5FM, Wednesday, August 10, 2022, Montserrado County District #16 Representative Dixon Seboe claimed that under the new amended alien and nationality law of Liberia, persons with dual citizenship are allowed to contest for Representatives and senators but cannot be speaker of the House of Representatives and President Pro-Tempore of the Liberian Senate. The claim was made in the 14 minute of the show and was carried live on the station’s Facebook page with over two thousand viewers and more than one hundred and fifty comments. This show is one of the most widely listened to shows in the country. Given how controversial this case has been over decades and the premium attention it has garnered owing to the amendment of the law, DUBAWA decided to investigate the claim made by Representative Dixon Seboe. This Fact Checker combed through the provisions of the old law which the amendment sought  to change. The old laws include Part III, Chapter 20, Section 20.1; Chapter 21, Sections 21.30, 21.31, 21.51 & 21.52 and Chapter 22, Sections 22.1, 22.1 & 22.4 of the Aliens and Nationality Law of the Liberian Code of Law Revised, Vol. II. DUBAWA then went further to look at the new amendment passed by Parliament to ascertain if the claim by the Representative was true. Part of the new amendment can be accessed in this news report with the relevant portions of the new law quoted as follows; “A Liberian citizen who holds citizenship for another country shall not be eligible for any elective public office while still a citizen of another country,” the legislature said in the repeal of the Aliens and Nationality Law. “If such a person desires to contest, the person must renounce the citizenship of the other country at least one year before applying to the National Elections Commission (NEC) to contest with documentary evidence of such renunciation from the country and filed with a circuit court in Liberia.” “Also, a Liberian citizen who holds the citizenship of another country must not be eligible for appointment to the public offices of Minister of Finance and Development Planning; Minister of Defense, and Executive Governor of the Central Bank of Liberia.” As can be seen, the amended law prohibits those with dual citizenship from occupying an elected office and from becoming Minister of Defense, Governor of the Central Bank of Liberia and Minister of Finance in the country. The new law has received massive media reviews and reportage as can be seen here and here.   Checks by DUBAWA into the amended law do not support the claim made by Representative Dixon Seboe. While the amended law grants Liberians power to hold dual citizenship it does not allow dual citizens to occupy elected office and other sensitive positions.

Claim: A viral WhatsApp message claims broccoli can prevent and cure breast cancer.,"Breast cancer is the most common invasive cancer in females and recently, a viral WhatsApp message claims consuming broccoli can prevent and cure it.  The WhatsApp message contained the link to a website, global excellence, which carries an expanded claim that broccoli helps with other types of cancer. Verifying if this vegetable is a cure or not is important to guide the public’s choice of food. Broccoli is a cruciferous vegetable (vegetables of the family Brassicaceae with many genera, species, and cultivars being raised for food production) with many benefits.  It is a rich source of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants which can help prevent the development of various conditions. The body produces molecules called free radicals during natural processes such as metabolism. Free radicals are highly reactive and unstable molecules with a lifespan of only a fraction of a second.  They are toxic in large amounts and can cause cell damage that can lead to cancer and other conditions. While the body can eliminate many of them, dietary antioxidants are said to be helpful because they can neutralise unstable molecules, reducing the risk of damage. This is where broccoli is believed to play a role in cancer prevention and cure.  Broccoli is an excellent food source of the natural cancer-fighting compound sulforaphane (SFN). SFN is a common antioxidant and the most potent anticancer plant active substance found in vegetables. The National Cancer Institute notes that studies in animals show increased levels of exogenous antioxidants prevent the types of free radical damage associated with cancer development.  A study reviewing literature on the topic notes that SFN has the potential to prevent disease development or recurrence and metastasizing, and as a compound protecting normal cells against the toxic effects of cytostatics. Another study notes that broccoli and its sprouts contain naturally occurring isothiocyanates such as SFN which has potent cancer-fighting properties.  While in vitro and animal experiments have shown this process, further clinical studies and human trials related to their safety, side effects, isolation and therapeutic dosage are needed to provide an insight into the beneficial effects of these isothiocyanates. Sunday Idoko, a gynaecologist at Garki hospital Abuja said broccoli is a vegetable that contains antioxidants which help with free radicals but he is not sure about this claim.  “I’m not so sure of this. But it’s a vegetable, they are filled with antioxidants which help deal with free radicals that have carcinogenic properties” he explained. Jeremiah Agim, a senior registrar at the National hospital Abuja said he has no comment on this claim as it is still under research.   “I don’t have one, it’s still at research level. Look through the above research papers” he said.  Arinze Obiadazie, a medical officer, simply said, “this is not true”.  Conclusion  Although broccoli has a cancer-fighting property, SFN, there are still ongoing clinical trials on this. So broccoli cannot be said to prevent or cure breast cancer or any other kind of cancer yet.  ",MISLEADING,15/08/2022,https://dubawa.org/claim-broccoli-prevents-or-cure-breast-cancer-is-misleading/
"Claim: A Twitter user claimed a collection of pictures he shared is that of northerners Peter Obi has pursued from Anambra State.

He further claimed Mr Obi, while serving as governor, demolished a mosque. The claim is false. All the alleged pictures were taken from totally different contexts that are unrelated to the claim.  A user on Twitter, Qudus Akanbi Eleyi (@Qdpaper2) claims that Peter Obi demolished a mosque in Anambra and pursued Hausa, Fulani and other northerners from the state while he was still governor. A collection of pictures that depict what appears to be a demolished mosque and of several persons in a desolate state was used to accompany the post with the caption: “Northerners will never forget Peter Obi for demolishing their mosque in Anambra. When he was a governor, Hausa, Fulani and Northerners can forgive Peter Obi for pursuing them out of Anambra, but I’m not sure if they can forgive him for demolishing their mosque. They will never 4give.” Peter Obi is the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LB) for the 2023 Nigerian presidential election. Since his emergence as the party’s candidate, the former two-term governor of Anambra has garnered so much attention on social media, especially on Twitter, arousing both support and criticism from diverse users.   Anambra is a state in the southeastern part of Nigeria, a region that is largely populated by the Igbo-speaking tribe who are mainly Christians. The Fulani and Hausa tribes are mostly Muslims, and they are largely the dominant population in the northern parts of Nigeria.  Like most social media claims, painted along religious and tribal lines, the tweet attracted massive traction and almost two thousand interactions within a week of its appearance.  One user, Baba (@antibila) has since believed the claims, adding that Peter Obi deported northerners from the southeast and destroyed their place of worship.    “Even in some Northern states, Okada has been banned for security reasons. As for Peter Obi, I learnt (he) went further than deporting Northerners going about their genuine businesses out of Iboland (Southeastern Nigeria), but also destroyed their place of worship against laws of the Land,” the user wrote. Such claims are capable of inciting violence and can even motivate both tribal and religious tensions.  One of the images depicting the alleged destroyed mosque in Anambra A Google reverse image search of the first image, a collage of Peter Obi and the alleged demolished mosque, traced the original image of the mosque to a news report: “Cash shortage hampers rebuilding of mosques destroyed by Israel.”   The report revealed the mosque to be the Omar Ibn Abdul Aziz mosque in Beit Hanoun, northern Gaza Strip, that was destroyed during the Israel-Palestine tension that erupted on 4 January 2009. Multiple reports by different media outlets captured the incident and detailed how the bombings flattened the Omar Ibn Abdul Aziz mosque in Beit Hanoun and damaged many surrounding homes. Apparently, the image has also been falsely used to depict an alleged banning of Islam and the destruction of mosques in Angola.   A Google reverse search of the second image traced it to a report on sanction.org, a social action website. The social action team members captured the original image when they visited the Obidianso Waterside community in Port Harcourt after the Rivers State government demolished it in 2018.  The image was not from Anambra State as alleged and has nothing to do with the northerners or the Hausa-Fulani Muslims residing in Anambra State. The third image is traced to a news report by Vanguard when officers of Abuja Police Command arrested 98 scavengers, popularly known as ‘Baban Bola’ over stealing in Abuja. The image is neither taken in Anambra nor does it have anything to do with Hausa-Fulani Muslims living in Anambra State. This is equally false.  The fourth image, a collage of pictures, was traced to the website of the Muslim News Nigeria. The pictures were used to depict an alleged demolition of a mosque in Port Harcourt by Governor Nysom Wike in 2019.  Although Governor Wike has distanced himself from claims that he ordered the demolition of a mosque in Port Harcourt, he has, however, explained that some persons started erecting illegal foundations on the disputed land, even though they had no approval to embark on any construction work. An extensive investigation by the PREMIUM TIMES also revealed that the Rivers State Government did not demolish any completed building being used as a mosque. However, an uncompleted structure, (the same one depicted in the alleged picture) which was still at the foundation stage, was demolished by the government. Unlike Governor Wike’s popular controversy over the demolition of a mosque in Rivers State, there is no single report by any reliable media outlet that suggests Peter Obi’s demolition of a mosque in Anambra State while he was still the governor.  While the claim may be debatable, all the images used are pulled from different contexts to support the bogus narrative. This claim is false.

Claim: A Facebook user shared a post with several claims on the functionality of the kidney and related diseases.,"Claim: A Facebook user shared a post with several claims on the functionality of the kidney and related diseases.  Three of the Facebook claims identified in this post are true while the other two are misleading claims. According to the National Kidney Foundation, 10% of the population worldwide is affected by chronic kidney disease (CKD), and millions die each year because they do not have access to affordable treatment. PubMed posits that the incidence of CKD (Chronic kidney disease) in Nigeria has been shown by various studies to range between 1.6 and 12.4 per cent. Some weeks ago, Tribune reported that the Managing Director, Rencare African Limited,  Mr Zahi El-Khatib, said no fewer than 20, 000 Nigerians develop end-stage kidney disease every year. On April 1, 2022, a prominent Nigerian actor widely known by his stage name and his comic appearances in Yoruba movies, Dejo Tunfulu, lost his life to kidney disease, Punch reported. Kidney disease has taken the lives of many in developed and developing countries, as a result, conversations continue to be centred around its cause and preventive measures.  Hence, a Facebook user, Aramide Olayemi Olaleye, in a Facebook group, Aramide Health Tips, shared a post with claims about the causes of kidney disease, sternly advising her followers to avoid the listed causes. The Facebook group was created to share health tips by the administrator who served as the claimant and shared a list of causes of kidney disease in the group. Since the publication of the lists, the post has attracted over 200 likes, 100 shares and 50 comments.  Most of the commenters thanked the platform’s admin for sharing the post. Patience Ugwuegede, one of the commenters wrote, “Informative and Educative. Thanks.” Another commenter, Ayan Abel Abiona, prayed for the admin: “Very Educative, God Bless You.” The virality of the post and the likelihood of readers applying the information to the management of their health has necessitated this verification  We highlighted five claims from this list and addressed them individually. Claim 1: Delaying going to the toilet, and keeping your urine in your bladder for too long is a bad idea. Verdict 1: TRUE In an article titled ‘Holding Your Pee: Is it Safe?’ Healthline notes that in rare cases, urine can go back up into the kidneys and lead to an infection or kidney damage. Medical News Today also noted that “in some cases, holding in pee for too long can cause bacteria to multiply. This may lead to a urinary tract infection (UTI).” On the dangers of delaying going to the toilet, Dr Babaniji Omosule, a nephrologist at the Clinical fellowship Renal Medicine, Worcestershire Royal Hospital advised that it is good to urinate promptly to avoid infection.  “It is always good to urinate promptly as this might increase the risk of urine infections, as regular and good urine emptying prevents stasis which can be a focus for promoting infections.” Our findings show that it is good to urinate promptly to avoid urinary infections. Good urine emptying prevents stasis which may lead to kidney infections. Hence, the claim is true. Claim 2: Eating too much salt causes kidney disease. Verdict 2: TRUE Action on Salt, a group concerned with salt and its effects on health based at the Queen Mary University of London and supported by 24 expert scientific members explains the relationship between the consumption of salt and the kidney. According to the organisation, a high salt intake has been linked to an increase in protein in the urine, which is a key risk factor for kidney disease. There is now mounting evidence that a high salt intake can hasten the progression of renal disease in persons who already have it. In an article in Economic Times, Doctor Kamlesh Parikh calls on readers to check their sodium intake.  He said: “High-salt diets generally tend to alter the sodium balance in the body, causing the kidneys to malfunction and retain excess water. This process puts strain on the kidneys and may even lead to renal failure.” Meanwhile, Dr Omosule revealed that “too much salt is not healthy generally and it can indirectly affect the kidney.” He explained that too much salt has the potential to cause high blood pressure and that itself can cause or worsen kidney disease as high blood pressure is a leading cause of kidney disease. According to the National Kidney Foundation, a dedicated organisation focused on fighting kidney disease, diabetes and high blood pressure are the two major causes of kidney disease.  WebMd also states that diabetes and high blood pressure are the two major causes of kidney disease. Our findings reveal that too much salt is not good for the body. High salt intake causes high blood pressure which is one of the leading causes of kidney disease. Claim 3: Eating too much meat causes kidney disease. Verdict 3: TRUE The National Kidney Foundation explains that the animal protein found in meat causes high levels of acid in the blood, which can harm the kidneys and lead to acidosis (a condition in which the kidneys are unable to eliminate acid quickly enough).  Although all parts of the body require protein for growth, maintenance, and repair, a diet should be well balanced with fruits and vegetables. Also, Medicinenet reported that a study carried out in Singapore suggests that eating red meat may boost the risk of kidney failure. According to the report, red meat intake, mostly pork, is strongly associated with an increased risk of end-stage renal disease, and the loss of normal kidney function. A similar report is also found on WebMD.  Piedmont, similarly, on its list of kidney-damaging foods notes that diets high in animal protein from meats and dairy products can cause kidney damage because they can be very hard to metabolize. Meanwhile, Dr Omosule explained that “too much red meat  also might not directly cause kidney disease but can cause raised cholesterol which will increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases such as heart attack.”   He also noted that cardiovascular diseases tend to be higher in patients with kidney disease. Our findings have shown that the protein from meats and dairy products can cause kidney damage. Hence, the claim is true. Claim 4: Drinking too much caffeine causes kidney disease. Verdict 4: MISLEADING  Fresenius Kidney Care, an organisation helping people with chronic kidney disease, notes that Caffeine, in general, is unlikely to harm your kidneys if consumed in small amounts. The website explains that caffeine is a stimulant that can cause increased blood flow, blood pressure, and kidney stress. Caffeine abuse has also been linked to kidney stones. As reported by the Independent, blood metabolites linked to coffee use have been revealed by researchers at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health to potentially increase the chance of acquiring kidney disease. According to the National Kidney Foundation, research has not shown that drinking 3-4 cups of coffee a day increases the risk of kidney disease or increases the rate of decline of kidney function. However, moderating how much coffee you drink is a good idea. Research by the National Institute of Health shows that carbonated beverage consumption has been linked to diabetes, hypertension, and kidney stones, all risk factors for chronic kidney disease. In fact, the research posits that drinking two or more colas per day was associated with an increased risk of chronic kidney disease. Dr Omosule, however, noted that he is not aware of any proven direct or indirect link between caffeine and kidney disease. “A few isolated studies have argued for and against,” he added. Studies on coffee and carbonated drinks all point to the fact that there is an increased risk of acquiring chronic kidney disease when they are consumed in excess but there is no direct causal link. Claim 5: Not drinking water causes kidney disease. Verdict 5: MISLEADING  The National Kidney Foundation states that severe dehydration can cause kidney damage, so it is advised that people drink plenty of water when working or exercising hard, especially in hot and humid weather. According to the foundation, some studies have found that even frequent mild dehydration can cause permanent kidney damage. Norman Urology concurs with the National Kidney Foundation’s assertion. According to Norman Urology, Chronic and severe dehydration can lead to permanent kidney damage including low kidney function and kidney failure. Kidney Research UK notes that drinking sufficient levels of fluid daily is an important part of kidney health. The organisation affirmed that drinking a lot of fluids may help lessen the chance of developing chronic kidney disease by assisting the kidneys in excreting waste products like urea and salt, according to researchers in Australia and Canada. Mayo Clinic also mentions that dehydration can lead to serious complications which include urinary and kidney problems. The organisation explains that prolonged or repeated bouts of dehydration can lead to urinary tract infections, kidney stones and even kidney failure. On the impact of dehydration, according to the nephrologist, not drinking enough water can affect the kidney. “It can make you dehydrated and that is why we often encourage people to drink plenty of water.” Our findings from a nephrologist and professional medical websites indicate that dehydration, which includes not drinking water or sufficient levels of fluids, can affect the kidney and cause serious complications which include urinary and kidney problems. Our findings show that three out of the five claims identified in this post are true while two are misleading.  What Obasanjo said about Peter Obi and 2023 election.

Claim: Oral sex can lead to throat cancer.,"Oral sex, an act of foreplay which involves the kissing or licking of the genital area to stimulate a partner is popular among sex partners.  A Facebook user, Dozie Egeonu, shared the screenshot of a report with the claim that “licking” a woman can cause throat cancer.  According to the headline of this report, this claim was made by a gynaecologist.  While some users agree with this claim, others disagree. Frankie Noel Franklin, who believes this is true, wrote, “It is true. Joke apart.” He also narrated a personal experience that another Facebook user said was a result of HPV. Another user, Lisa Marie Schmitt, however, refuted the claim, tagging it as “fake news.” Seeing the controversy this stirred on Facebook and the need to educate the general public to take informed decisions about their sexuality, DUBAWA decided to verify this claim  We first tried to trace the alleged report since it was a screenshot that was shared. We found the original article on the website MyNewsGh.com. with the same claim.  The article quoted Dr Hawa Malechi, as saying the Human Papillomavirus (HPV) that causes cervical cancer, can also cause cancer of the penis as well as throat cancer. The Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is an infection that causes warts in various parts of the body, depending on the strain. The Centre for Disease Control (CDC) notes that HPV can spread during vaginal, anal, or oral sex with someone who has the virus. Someone with HPV can pass the infection to another person even when they have no signs or symptoms. There are different types of HPV, and some can increase the risk of cancer. This article by Medical News Today notes HPV which can spread during oral sex, increasing the possibility of cancer.  HPV can cause cervical cancer, cancer of the vulva, vagina, penis, or anus. It can also cause cancer in the back of the throat (called oropharyngeal cancer). However, getting HPV can be prevented through vaccination. The HPV vaccine is safe and effective and can protect against diseases (including cancers) caused by HPV when given in the recommended age groups. A gynaecologist and senior registrar at the National Hospital, Abuja, Jeremiah Agim, confirmed this claim to be true saying the virus that causes cervical cancer also causes throat cancer.  “Yea, both from Cunnilingus and fellatio.The Human Papillomavirus that causes cervical cancer is responsible for the throat cancer too.”  He, however, clarified that this does not mean everyone who performs such sexual acts will end up with throat cancer. It’s only when the act is performed on an infected person. Our findings reveal that the HPV which causes cervical, vulva, penis and anus cancer is also responsible for throat cancer and this can be transmitted during oral sex.

Claim: The chairman of the APC said he does not underestimate Peter Obi’s ability to lead his people to victory.,"As the 2023 election draws near, political actors continue to make appearances on television stations to speak about issues pertaining to their party and the election.  Recently, the screenshot of a tweet with the claim that the National chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Abdullahi Adamu, praised the presidential candidate of Labour Party, Peter Obi, went viral.  The statement attributed to the national chairman in the screenshot reads “I visited Peter Obi when he was Anambra State Governor and he means well for Nigeria, so I have no reason whatsoever to underestimate his ability to lead his people to victory.” The screenshot which did not show the Twitter account that shared it suggested this was from a program on Arise News Television.  Pre-election period is a critical period because the words of politicians can be twisted or taken out of context to favour one party over another, hence the need for this verification.  The screenshot was also shared with DUBAWA for verification.  We traced and found the original tweet by OlisaemekalumOrakwyelumOdujwe (@ddukehmslf). In the comment section of this tweet, a Twitter user, Edena MD (@edanamoris), requested the source of the claim, “Source please,” he commented.  Another user (@Tovincetokwy) commented that if there is an actual video of the chairman making this statement, it should be taken down as this can be used against “them.” Responding to the first user, Will (@Free_dom237), provided a link to a YouTube video by Arise News.  “Here is the link to the video. Enjoy,” he tweeted. The tweet has so far garnered 1,032 retweets, 38 quote tweets, and 2,707 likes.  A keyword search led to reports by the Daily Post, Legit, and top Naija with this claim, quoting the same interview by Arise News.  DUBAWA, therefore, visited Arise News YouTube page looking to find a recent interview with the chairman of the APC. We found a 59-minute interview on Sunday, July 17, 2022. The video titled “I am not aware the APC lost in Osun” addressed issues on the outcome of the Osun election and its influence on the 2023 general election.  At about 31 minutes into the interview, the chairman was asked if he saw the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and LP as a threat. In his response, he said he does not underestimate the ability of both parties or their candidates to lead their people to victory.  “Peter Obi, I knew him when he was governor of Anambra State. I visited him when I was governor, and these are people that mean well as far as I am concerned. From their outburst, they mean well.  “They are well grounded, I don’t have doubts on that so I have no reason whatsoever to underestimate their ability to lead their people, to lead their party to victory but I am telling you that we are better organised…” Mr Adamu said.  Our findings show that the APC chairman actually said he does not doubt the ability of Peter Obi or any opposition party to lead his people to victory. He made this statement during an appearance on Arise News TV  but noted his party is better organised to win the 2023 election.

"Claim: Hollywood actor, Tom Hanks, endorsed the candidacy of Peter Obi.","Claim: Hollywood actor, Tom Hanks, endorsed the candidacy of Peter Obi.  There is no record to show Tom Hanks endorsed the candidacy of Peter Obi or made reference to him at any point.  Endorsements by political actors, religious actors and influencers are seen as a win for politicians, especially by their supporters who love to amplify such endorsements.  Recently, the screenshot of a Facebook post alleging Hollywood actor, Thomas Jeffrey Hanks, popularly known as Tom Hanks, endorsed the candidacy of Peter Obi, went viral.  “If Peter Obi was an American or even African American, Americans would have given him a one-way presidential ticket without him contesting,” part of the post read. The virality of the claim and requests from our readers prompted us to verify this screenshot.  To find the original post which seemed to have originated from Facebook, we conducted a keyword search on Facebook and found this has been shared by Best News Network, Readitt and several other Facebook users who attributed this to Philip Ojealao.  DUBAWA  conducted a search to find posts by Philip Ojealao on Facebook and found that the post with this claim was shared on Sunday, July 17, 2022.  The post which had garnered over 14,000 likes, 1,000 comments and over 2,000 shares credited this claim to Tom Hanks.  We researched the actor and found his official account on Instagram and Twitter. On Instagram, Tom Hanks (@tomhanks) did not have any posts related to Peter Obi.  On Twitter, we observed that @tomhanks did not have a recent post; his last post was in May 2022.  A Google search also does not show any report of the actor making any comments related to Mr Obi.

"Claim: A statement, which has gone viral on Facebook and other social media platforms, has a claim that Lai Mohammed, Nigeria’s minister of information, said the government increased fuel and diesel prices so as to reduce accidents and traffic on Nigerian roads.","Since the start of the year, many parts of Nigeria have been experiencing fuel scarcity and increase in the price of fuel across the country, leading to an increase in price recently.  Oil marketers reportedly increased the price of Premium Motor Spirit(PMS), following approval by the Nigerian National Petroleum(NNPC) Limited for an upward review in the pump price from N165 per litre to N179 per litre.  Following the increase in fuel price and diesel price, social media users have started circulating a statement attributed to the Minister of Information saying that the price was increased so as to reduce traffic and accidents on Nigerian roads.  The statement being circulated reads: “We raised fuel price to 200 Naira and Diesel to 800 Naira to reduce the number of traffic and accidents in Nigeria–Lai.” DUBAWA observed that many of the social media users who commented on the post attacked the information minister for purportedly making such a comment. Because of the controversies that have trailed the statement, DUBAWA decided to check its authenticity so as to put the argument of whether the minister said it to rest.  A close look at the statement attributed to the information minister shows that there was no mention of the date the minister purportedly made the statement. Several checks on previous statements made by Mohammed on the increase of fuel price led DUBAWA to a report by Vanguard published on 16th May 2016. Going through the report, DUBAWA observed that the minister did not make such a statement attributed to him. Also, an online review of credible media platforms showed that there was no such reportage. When DUBAWA contacted Segun Adeyemi, spokesperson of the information minister, he said his principal did not make such a statement.  Adeyemi said, “It is totally fake, please disregard it.”  The statement attributed to Lai Mohammed, claiming the government increased fuel and diesel prices to reduce accidents and traffic on Nigerian roads is false. DUBAWA’s checks on previous statements made by Mr Mohammed on price increase of fuel and diesel showed the minister did not make such statements attributed to him.

"Claim: A Twitter user shared an image of a flooded poultry farm, claiming it is in Lagos State, Nigeria.","During rainy seasons, there are usually reports of floods in Lagos and this year is no exception. The impact of the floods has been so devastating that Premium Times recently reported that seven people died in the Lagos flood. On Twitter, TrackaNG shared pictures of Herbert Macaulay Way, Yaba, Lagos, calling the attention of the government to the flood due to a poor drainage system. Similarly, Punch Newspaper also reported that flood has taken over Okota Area in Lagos. This led to Twitter users sharing pictures of flooded areas in Lagos. A Twitter user, Larry (@doplarry), shared an image of a flooded poultry, claiming it is a flooded poultry farm in Lagos State. “Someone’s poultry farm in Lagos,” he captioned. A Twitter user, TheDavidOyebode (_Daevids) in his comment to the picture expressed his dismay. “Omooo, this one is really bad,” he tweeted. Another user, I am_Grant (daikman_1) tweeted, “Kai…this is so sad.” A Twitter user, however, countered this claim. “Dis isn’t Lagos, this is an old Picture and did not happen in lagos,” Olarenwaju (jimiroye1) tweeted. The tweet has attracted more than 900 likes, 300 retweets, and 70 quote tweets. A similar claim was made on Facebook by a page, Senior Man, which claimed that the picture is someone’s poultry farm in Lagos. The contradicting views about this picture and its virality prompted DUBAWA to fact-check this claim. DUBAWA carried out a reverse image search to verify the claim that the image is of a poultry farm in Lagos. We found that the particular image had been on the internet since 2021. A Bolivian website, Los Tiempos has the image featured in a news report that the Bolivian Navy evacuated 30 families from the tropics affected by flood while there are two thousand hectares of damaged crops by flood caused by heavy rains in the municipalities of Chimoré and Puerto Villarroel, Bolivia on April 26, 2021. A Facebook page, Konkosah GH, also shared this image, saying it is a poultry farm in Kumasi, Ghana. The post dates back to June 25, 2021.

"Claim: Mr Bio claimed that if you go around the world, Sierra Leone comes first when you talk about gender empowerment.","President of the Republic of Sierra Leone, Rtd Brigadier Julius Maada Bio, has reiterated his government’s commitment to fulfil promises made to the people of Moyamba. One of such promises was the reconstruction of the Mabang Bridge which has been in a deplorable state for years. The bridge has since been reconstructed and a ceremony was held to commission it. During the commissioning, President Bio applauded the spirit of cooperation between his government and the European Union, which both parties claim have resulted in several infrastructure projects across the country.  The 231-metre double-lane Mabang bridge connects Ribbi Chiefdom, Moyamba District in the south of the country and Koya Chiefdom Port Loko in the North and it’s a significant route for economic activities. The bridge collapsed about nine years ago and has just been reconstructed for use.  During the commissioning, President Bio expanded the conversation to the recently concluded UNESCO conference on Education in Paris where he boasted that his government has been recognised around the world as a leader in education. His regime’s contribution to education in four years, he stated, got him invited to co-chair the UNESCO meeting on education and would see him co-chair September’s UN General Assembly.  In his words “I am not someone that loves to blush but I was pleasantly happy when a UNICEF boss told me he wants to come over to Sierra Leone to not teach but learn from us how we have been able to undertake what we have done in the middle of COVID.” He also claimed Sierra Leone was ranked first in the world as far as women empowerment is concerned.  The claim about gender empowerment was made in the 0.13- 0.20 seconds of the president’s speech. He spoke in the country’s popular lingua franca- Krio during the commissioning.  The ceremony was also widely transmitted across the country. The claim by the president on Sierra Leone’s position on the global stage when it comes to women empowerment was huge and DUBAWA saw the need to check the veracity of the claim by looking at the recent Global Gender Gap report of 2022.   The July edition which is the most recent publication has been shared through the World Economic Forum platform. The Global Gender Gap index benchmarked the current state and evolution of gender parity across four key dimensions as expressed by the managing director Saaida Zahidi in the report. These four dimensions are key criteria taken into account when advancing gender empowerment and the criteria are: Economic participation and opportunity, educational attainment, health and survival, and political empowerment. According to the findings of the report, 146 nations were represented in the global gender gap closed by 68.1%. However,  it will take an estimated 132 years to reach full global parity. The report also categorised the gains made in closing the gender gap in the four areas with the health and survival gender gap closed by 95.8%, educational attainment by 94%, economic opportunity and participation by 60% and political empowerment by 22%. According to Page 5 of the report even though none of the countries met the gender parity status, there are however top ranked countries with the most improved records on gender empowerment and Sierra Leone is not the first as claimed by President Bio. Three Scandinavian nations lead the global rankings.  Iceland comes first with a percentage of 90.8%, followed by Finland at 86%, Norway at 84.5%. Only two African nations ranked in the top ten; Rwanda and Namibia.  Sierra Leone ranks 109(0.672) in the global ranking and 22nd in Africa in terms of bridging the gender gap and empowerment. Africa’s top five ranked nations are Rwanda 0.811, Namibia 0.87, Burundi 0.782, Mozambique 0.752 and Cape Verde 0.736. With these data, the claim by  President Bio that Sierra Leone comes first in gender and women empowerment is totally untrue. As much as Sierra Leone continues to make commendable strides in gender empowerment, it has not reached the peak of leading the global ranks as the first country in terms of gender and women empowerment. Therefore, the claim by Mr Bio is false.  ",FALSE-,20/07/2022,https://dubawa.org/sierra-leone-is-not-considered-first-in-women-empowerment-in-the-world-as-claimed-by-president-bio/
Claim: A Facebook user claims that OPay is giving out free point of sale (POS) terminals.,"Recently, a Facebook user named Atoshu Elias took to a Facebook page named “‎NIGERIA POLICE FORCE ALONE” in which he announced that OPay is giving out free POS terminals. With an additional free registration promise, he also instructed interested users to comment with their locations and phone number. His post reads: “OPAY COMPANY IS GIVING AWAY FREE POS MACHINE, INTRESTED PEOPLE SHOULD DROP THEIR NUMBER AND LOCATION REGISTRATION IS FREE.” However, without doubting this claim, 60 individuals quickly indicated interest and registered their private information in the comment section.  OPay is a Nigeria-based mobile money platform that offers deposit and withdrawal services to its customers. As stated on its website, it is licensed by the Central Bank of Nigeria and has spread its services across all 36 states of the country, since its launching in 2018. With POS business now becoming a popular source of income in Nigeria, it is not out of place for Nigerians to jump on opportunities such as this. Moreover, DUBAWA has observed that scammers usually adopt this format to dupe unsuspecting members of the public. Hence, the reason for this fact-check. Firstly, DUBAWA checked the verified Facebook page of the company but found no related information. For the same purpose, we also visited the company’s website but no “giveaway” news was found.  DUBAWA then emailed Hanson Olorunfemi, the Communications Manager of OPay. He confirmed that the firm recently gave out “free MPOS (Mini POS) terminals” to their potential agents across the country. He, however, noted that this promotional campaign has ended since the “first week of July 2022.” “The potential agent can download the OPay app and apply for the POS terminal, the agent will be assigned to an aggregator who will then issue a POS terminal to the agent.  “To be Eligible, you must have a physical business location and must have updated KYC requirements to KYC 3. Third party in this case will be an OPay accredited Aggregator,” Mr Olorunfemi further explained. Our findings show that OPay is not giving out free POS terminals at the moment. Although it recently did for promotional purposes, the campaign ended since the first week of July. ",MISLEADING,19/07/2022,https://dubawa.org/opay-not-giving-nigerians-free-pos-terminals/
"Claim: A viral video suggests the convoy of the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress(APC), Bola Tinubu, was attacked after a mega rally.","The presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu, on Tuesday, July 12, 2022, attended a rally in Osogbo, the Osun State capital to campaign for governor Adegboyega Oyetola. Mr Oyetola is seeking a second term of four years in Saturday’s July 16 governorship election in Osun state. Shortly after the rally,  social media was awash with a video suggesting that the APC presidential candidate and his entourage were attacked by angry youths of the state.  However, reading through the comment, we discovered conflicting comments. While some believe the event happened during the rally, some were quick to discard it as an old video.  As Saturday’s election in Osun state draws near, DUBAWA saw the need to verify this claim because it may lead to anxiety and tension among electorates during the election.   A keyword search for the alleged attack on Mr Tinibu’s entourage did not lead to any news report by any credible news organisation.  DUBAWA conducted a frame-by-frame analysis of the video on the InVid Video verification tool.  Results from the analysis show that the earliest version of the video appeared online on 17th  October 2020 during the popular Endsars protest.  The video was posted by multiple media houses like Channels, TVC, and AIT Online, with captions such as: “Hoodlums attack Osun state governor, Gboyega Oyetola as he addresses #EndSARS protesters at Olaiya Junction in Osogbo.” Credible newspapers like Premium Times, Cable, Vanguard, and Tribune, among others also published reports of the attack by the hoodlums on Mr Oyetola’s convoy in 2020.  During the attack, it was reported that at least two protesters were killed by armed thugs who attacked the Governor’s convoy.  We also reached out to the spokesperson of Tinubu Campaign Organisation, Bayo Onanuga, but he did not pick up calls or reply to messages sent to him via text and WhatsApp.  The viral video with the narrative that the APC presidential candidate, Mr Tinubu was attacked after a mega rally of the party in Osun state is false.

"The stage is set for the Osun State governorship election holding today, Saturday 16th June.","The stage is set for the Osun State governorship election holding today, Saturday 16th June.  1,479,595 registered voters are eligible to participate in the election across the 30 local government areas in the state. According to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), these are the number of persons out of the 1,955,657 registered voters who have collected their Permanent Voters Card (PVCs). A total of 21, 000 police personnel, 79 local and eight foreign observers, have been deployed for the election with a promise of a transparent election by the electoral commission.  15 candidates are contesting to run the affairs of the state for another four years. DUBAWA, in partnership with journalists and observers on the ground, will be running quick checks to debunk claims on the election. Claim: The official PDP handle on Twitter (@officialPDPNig) claims that the Nigerian Army arrested Asiri Eniba, Chairman of NURTW in Osun State with assorted rifles and other dangerous weapons on Friday, July 15.  Although the army has yet to confirm the occurrence or respond to calls placed by DUBAWA, reports by PunchNG and other reliable media platforms stated that some soldiers arrested Asiri  Eniba with some weapons in Osogbo on Friday. Claim: A Twitter user (@Gyalep), in efforts to convince voters to vote for Governor Oyetola,  claims the governor has approved the release of over N477 million as premium for citizens under the Osun Health Insurance Scheme, OHIS. It is no big secret. Governor Oyetola has been widely reported by various media outlets to have released N477.9 million as a premium for the enrolment of vulnerable citizens into the Osun Health Insurance Scheme (OHIS). Details of the report were published on this PunchNg report. Claim: A Twitter user, Giyale Miemene Paul (@Gyalep) highlighting reasons why people should vote for the incumbent governor, Oyetola,  claims that he (Governor Oyetola) has refurbished and revitalised 332 PHCs in Osun. An exclusive report by Humangle reveals that the PHCs are not in a good condition contrary to what the state reported.  In a phone interview with Humanangle’s Adejumo Kabir, he reinstated the stance of their report and further revealed that the equipment meant to be procured were not. The Osun state government reacted to the findings confirming it as valid. Claim:  A WhatsApp message has a claim that the candidate of the Labour party, Lasun Yusuf, has stepped down for PDP candidate, Ademola Adeleke, in the ongoing Osun election. The Labour Party Candidate, Lasun Yusuf, said in a live interview on Channels Television that he has voted and is still in the race. Also, the national Chairman of the Labour party, Julius Abure, told DUBAWA the information is false. He added that Mr Yusuf is still in the race. Claim:  A Twitter user, (@iam_doctormayor) shared a video claiming that the police has intercepted thugs with locally made guns and charms at Ogbonarugbo Ward 8, Unit 7, Ilesa. Phillip Anjorin, a CJID observer who was at the location, confirmed that the police were at the location and indeed arrested some thugs who were in possession of charms and arms.  DUBAWA further analyzed the video, and the timestamp of the footage revealed it was captured and shared around 11: 30 a.m. today. Claim: A Twitter user, FUTA BRO (@FutsBro), shared a video wherein it was announced that the Osun governorship election had been declared inconclusive.  Our findings show that the video was from the 2018 Osun governorship election, which was declared inconclusive.  Claim: A Twitter user, QUEEN SADY (@HajiyaSadiya2), claims the PDP has won the Osun governorship election.  Updates from our observers show vote collation is still ongoing at different Local Government Areas and no winner has been declared.  Claim: A Twitter user Olumide_diamond (@OluwatobaAkind1), shared a Tik Tok video with the screenshot of a breaking news insinuating governor Oyetola said he was ‘ready to leave.’ A close look at the video, which has Tope Alabi’s music playing in the background, showed the screenshot was doctored. One, the screenshot does not contain the image or name of any media organisation, two, it does not show a timestamp which live reports usually carry and three, this has not been reported by any news platform.

"Claim: A viral video, making the rounds on WhatsApp has a claim that northerners are already learning how to use the electronic voting machine ahead of the 2023 general elections.","Recently, a video has surfaced on WhatsApp with the narrative that northerners are already practising how to vote with the electronic voting machine ahead of the 2023 elections. The post called on southerners to “wake up,” insinuating that the footage exposes a northern secret plan to gain an advantage in the upcoming 2023 polls.  Nigeria is geographically and ethnically divided into the north dominated by Hausa-Fulani and the south largely occupied by Yoruba, Igbo and other tribes. In the alleged video, some persons were seen in a room, huddled around a voting machine as they seemed engaged in what appeared to be a voting exercise.   The post reads, “Northerners are already learning how to use electronic voting machines. How many of us are aware this exists? Buhari and his allies in the northern part of Nigeria are already testing the electronic machine.”  Further, it pleads with users (southerners) to share the information. “Please pass this to all our  sleeping Southerners to wake up and be on alert.” Aware of the dangers such culturally-sensitive claims pose to the country, DUBAWA decided to fact-check. When DUBAWA ran a frame-by-frame analysis of the viral video on the InVid video verifier, the footage was traced to a voting exercise in Kaduna, which took place back in 2018 when the state initiated an electronic voting system for its chairmanship elections.  The earliest version of the video was traced to a Facebook post made by the “LEGACY PARTY OF NIGERIA SULEJA CHAPTER,” on January 31st, 2018. The narrative shared alongside the footage introduced the electronic voting system and how the Kaduna state used it for their elections.  “Below is the prototype of the electronic voting machine that was last year approved by the 8 national Assembly to be used in the forthcoming general election. Kaduna state is said to be the pilot state to ascertain the effectiveness of the voting machine for its local government chairmanship and councillors election slated for this year,” the narrative read.  The same video was also found to have been shared by a Facebook page, the “Movement for the Protection of Plateau Heritage and Dignity” (MOPPLAHD), on February, 8th 2018. Thereafter, it was also featured here and here.  Noticeably, all the places DUBAWA found the video suggested the footage was taken during the Kaduna State chairmanship elections in 2018, and not a discrete practice exercise for the northerners.  The Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) is lightweight and easy to transport, as no unit weighs more than 10kg. With a battery life of 10-16 hours depending on conditions, it facilitates an automated process that cuts out blank and void votes and ensures quick counting of results. On Saturday, May 12, 2018, voters in Kaduna State made history when they became the first electors in Nigeria to use the electronic voting machine to elect chairmen and councillors for the 23 local government councils in the state.  The video used to depict regional bias ahead of the 2023 general elections was taken out of context to mislead the public. The original footage was taken in 2018 when the electronic voting machines were first used for the Kaduna chairmanship elections in 2018. This claim is false.

"Claim: A Facebook user claims Abba Kyari was spotted in Australia, hours after the Kuje prison attack.","Following the recent attack on the Kuje Custodial Centre Abuja by suspected Boko Haram terrorists, that allowed hundreds of inmates to escape, a claim that suspended Deputy Commissioner of Police, Abba Kyari, has also escaped to Australia had been circulating on Facebook. Two pictures were attached to the claim. While one showed the back view of a man about to enter a motionless vehicle, the other showed the face of Abba Kyari wearing his police uniform. The claim reads: “Hours after Kuje prison attack, Abba Kyari Spotted in Australia” One of the posts which had already gathered 524 reactions, 109 comments and 75 shares has also sprouted a debate among users who believed it to be true and others,who did not.  For instance, Oluebube Abel, a user who believed the claim, said Mr Kyari’s escape was planned. “I won’t doubt it. It was a game they intentionally played against the 2023 election to have standby thugs but they won’t succeed,” he said. However, Isabella Stevenson was doubtful of the claim. “Isn’t possible for him to be in Australia because Australia isn’t Dubai that you get your visa within 24hrs,” the user wrote. Famous for his exploits, Mr Kyari is a Nigerian Deputy Commissioner of Police who is now suspended for misconduct. Before his fall, “he recorded headline-grabbing milestones including the arrests of kidnapping kingpins Evans, in Lagos, and Wadume, in Taraba, and led the rescue of a relative of President Muhammadu Buhari from a kidnappers’ den in Kano.” In March 2022, after he was charged for drug trafficking with six others, the Federal High Court Abuja ordered his transfer to the Kuje Correctional Centre.  In the past, DUBAWA has found claims like this to be discordant. Hence, the reason for this fact-check. DUBAWA first clicked a link attached to the claim. As described, it was supposed to lead to a video which shows Mr Kyari in Australia, but contrarily, it led to a blog that displayed an unrelated article. Unlike typical blogs that permit users to read content, this particular one, “worlnews.space” almost instantly redirects one to an advert. Efforts to disable the advert proved abortive. Rather, it further instructs users to download a mobile application. Also, DUBAWA analysed the background details of the site through Scamvoid, a tool used to check the integrity of websites. Results showed that the site had only existed for five months. DUBAWA further conducted a Google keyword search and found a recent news article by Premium Times which affirms the safety of Abba Kyari. As reported, the spokesperson of the Nigeria Correctional Service (NCoS), Umar Abubakar, who provided details about the attack confirmed that the suspended police officer did not escape. His statement reads in part: “The Service will deploy its Corrections Information Management System (CIMS) in synergy with National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) to track all fleeing inmates and return them to custody. This is also to confirm to the general public that DCP Abba Kyari and other VIPs held in the facility did not escape. They are presently in custody, hale and hearty.” The same was also reported by Vanguard, DailyTrust and other reputable news outlets. Our findings show that the website, whose link was attached to this claim, is not genuine. Also, the spokesperson of the Nigeria Correctional Service (NCoS) has confirmed that Abba Kyari is still in custody. The claim is, therefore, false.

"Claim: A photo of a man in Biafran apparel, standing on Nigeria’s flag at an event which looks like a protest ground outside Nigeria, has a caption that suggests the person is Oseloka Obi, son of a frontline presidential candidate, Peter Obi.","On Sunday, July 3, 2022, social media was awash with photos of two young men placed side-by-side to depict that Oseloka Obi, son of the Labour Party presidential candidate, Peter Obi, was standing on Nigeria’s flag and advocating for actualisation of Biafra Republic.  While one of the photos was that of a man in Biafran apparel standing on a Nigerian flag, the other is a headshot of Oseloka Obi.  The photos were widely circulated on Twitter and Facebook with several comments suggesting that Peter Obi cannot be trusted with the future of Nigeria.  One of the tweets with the photos was captioned: “2023: Peter Obi and the Dilemma of Nation Building- The man standing on the defaced Nigerian flag is Gregory Oseloka Obi, the son of the Labour Party’s presidential candidate, @peterObi. Think deeply before you hand over Nigeria to his father to manage.” DUBAWA observed that the photos have generated arguments between supporters of Mr Obi and other social media users.  A Twitter user, ‘Bettors Companion’ asked the presidential candidate to apologize because of the tweet portraying his son in a bad light.  He wrote, “@peterObi please come and apologise for this tweet which portrays your son in a bad light”.  Another user, @OKARIA noted, “How old is he; is he a child or an adult? If he is a child ask his father, if he is an adult hold him responsible for his action. You are complaining about the man standing on the flag, not those that fired the shots that soiled the flag. # cheap blackmail”.  Some users were, however, quick to note that the photo was fake and unrelated.  Looking at the controversies the photo has generated give Dubawa a reason to verify the claim.  DUBAWA conducted a Google reverse image search on the photo of the man with a Biafran crested vest. Results from the search show that the earliest version of the photo appeared online on 1st September 2021 in a tweet by a Pro-Biafra Twitter account created in August 2020.  The tweet had a caption: “That is the zoo Flag. Nice one.” Further search by DUBAWA showed that the same photo since 2021 has been widely circulated on social media by pro-Biafra agitators as seen here, here among other places.  In the photo, there was a police vehicle in the background of the post. However, checks by DUBAWA show that the car is a German police car in Munich.  When DUBAWA conducted a keyword search, “protest of Biafra in Germany,” it led us to a report by Saharareporters with a caption: “Biafra Supporters Storm British Embassy In Germany, Demand Nnamdi Kanu’s Release”.  According to the report, the Biafra supporters staged a demonstration at the British Embassy in Berlin, Germany over the arrest of the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB),  Nnamdi Kanu by the Nigerian government.  Shreds of evidence gathered from the footage of a video attached to the report led DUBAWA to a live stream on a Biafra Facebook page. The video was captioned: “IPOB demand the release of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu and a referendum on #Baifraexist”.  DUBAWA discovered that the placards and environment where the photo was taken were the same as the one in the video.  When DUBAWA conducted another reverse image search on the second photo in the post, results show that the image belongs to Oseloka Obi, the son of Peter Obi.  DUBAWA discovered that Oseloka Obi is a Hollywood actor and a member of the Actors Guild of Great Britain UK and goes by the stage name ELOKA IVO.  An image comparison of Oseloka Obi and the man with a Biafran crested vest showed some remarkable differences in size and other features. Although DUBAWA could not get details about the man standing on the Nigerian flag in the video, findings from an in-depth analysis suggest that  Oseloka Obi is different from the person the social media users were trying to portray him to be. He lives in the UK, but the protest where the photo was taken happened in Germany.  Also, DUBAWA contacted Valentine Obienyem, the media adviser to Mr Obi who described the tweets as “desperation of the opposition.” Mr Obienyem insisted that Oseloka Obi, who lives in the UK, did not step on Nigeria’s flag. He added, “the said young man is not Mr. Peter Obi’s son, who, by his strict upbringing marked by rigorous discipline, understands what civic duty and responsibilities entail. “Mr. Oseloka Obi is about six feet and taller than his father; while the young man they used for the mischief is slightly above 5 feet.” There is no evidence to show that the person in the viral photo is  Peter Obi’s son. Mr Obi’s media team described the photo as unrelated while DUBAWA discovered that the photo was taken during a protest in Germany.

Claim: A Facebook user claims delegates sent to the UK to get Ekweremadu a lawyer have been arrested.,"Claim: A Facebook user claims delegates sent to the UK to get Ekweremadu a lawyer have been arrested.  Our findings and confirmation from the leader of the delegation that they are still in Nigeria shows this claim is false. On Thursday, June 23, news of the arrest of Ike Ekweremadu, a former Deputy Senate President alongside his wife, Beatrice, for organ harvesting went viral.  Mr Ekweremadu arrested by the London Metropolitan Police was charged with alleged trafficking of one David Nwanini with the aim of harvesting his kidney. Reacting to this on Wednesday, June 29, 2022, the Senate said it will send a delegation of its committee on foreign affairs to London to see the couple. Following this news, a Facebook user, Inakede Denis, on Sunday July 3, 2022, in a post claimed that the delegates sent from Nigeria by the Federal Government to get a lawyer for Mr Ekweremadu were arrested by the United Kingdom (UK) Government. The sensitivity of this case, the need to keep the public abreast of the right information, and the damage this could cause for the image of the delegates and the country, prompted us to verify this claim. A keyword search showed no news report of this claim either by local or international media.  DUBAWA reached out to the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ferdinand Nwonye, via a text message and phone calls without any response.  We also reached out to Uche Anichukwu, the spokesperson of Mr Ekweremadu, via a text message and phone calls but got no response up until the time of publishing. A look at the website of the UK police and the UK government showed no report or press release on the said arrest so we contacted the UK Metropolitan police via text message and phone calls. As at the time of publishing, we are yet to get a response from the police.  DUBAWA reached out to the chairman of the senate committee on foreign affairs, Adamu Bulkachuwa, who is also the leader of the delegates via a WhatsApp message. Mr Bulkachuwa responded debunking the claim while noting the team is yet to leave Nigeria for the UK.  “I am the leader of the team and I am leaving  tomorrow,” he said. How then can a team that has not left Nigeria already be arrested in the UK?” The senate president Ahmed Lawal said the delegates are to visit Mr Ekweremadu, not get him a lawyer as claimed in this post. Mr Lawan also disclosed that the Nigerian High Commission had engaged the services of lawyers in the UK to defend the former Deputy Senate President when he appears in court. This report by Premium Times noted that during Mr Ekweremadu’s appearance in court on Thursday, June 30,2022, a large delegation from the Nigeria High Commission was present in the public gallery alongside two of the senator’s children.

"The stage is set for some governorship candidates, contesting in the July 16 Osun governorship election, to debate ahead of the polls.","The stage is set for some governorship candidates, contesting in the July 16 Osun governorship election, to debate ahead of the polls. Five candidates are expected to participate in the debate supported by Enough-is-Enough Nigeria (EiE Nigeria) and broadcast live on Arise Television. The candidates expected are; Akin Ogunbiyi of Accord party, incumbent governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Yusuf Lasun of Labour Party (LP), Ademola Adeleke of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), and Goke Omigbodun of the Social Democratic Party (SDP). The candidates will field questions bordering on education, security, economy and others from anchors. DUBAWA is monitoring the debate for live fact-checking of claims to ensure accuracy.  Below are quick checks on claims made during the debate: Claim 1: Incumbent governor, Adegboyega Oyetola of APC claimed he recruited 1,000 teachers in December 2021. This is true as the claim is supported by multiple news reports. Punch, Vanguard, The Nation and several other platforms reported the recruitment. Clamim 2: Akin Ogunbiyi says “this Government has five licences. Instead of partnering with internationally recognised mining companies, they chose to partner with the Chinese”. While it is true that Osun state has five valid mineral titles, they are not all awarded to Chinese companies. According to data from the Ministry of Mines and Steel Development, there are five valid mineral titles in Osun. Two of these titles are owned by private companies- a Nigerian (Kareem Mutiu Adubi) and a Canada-based mining exploration company (Segilola Resources Operating Ltd), two belong to Nigerian Mining Corporation Inc and the last title belongs to Omoluabi Mineral Promotion Company Limited. Claim 3: The candidate of the SDP, Goke Omigbodun, quoting UNICEF data, said the percentage of out-of-school children for primary school is 26.9% and 10.5% for secondary school. UNICEF 2016/2017 multiple indicator cluster survey shows that the figure given by Mr Omigbodun for out-of-school children in primary and secondary schools is correct. Claim 4: SDP candidate, Goke Omigbodun, said 47% of people in Osun State live below the poverty line, the worst in the federation. A 2020 data from NBS revealed that Osun State has a poverty index of 8.52% which is the state’s lowest index since return to democracy and third in the federation.

"Claim: A WhatsApp post has several claims around Bill Gates’ alleged military invasion of Nigeria, Atiku’s presidential candidacy, the National Health Act, and the attack on Owo church.","Following the emergence of presidential candidates for different political parties, many WhatsApp users are beginning to circulate different claims about the candidates. Recently, a WhatsApp post being circulated on different groups came with several claims about popular billionaire, Bill Gates’ alleged military invasion of Nigeria, Atiku’s presidential, candidacy, the National Health Act, and the attack on Owo church.  Part of the post suggests that the ISWAP terrorists that reportedly attacked Owo church in Ondo State were trained by Blackwater Army which was reportedly owned by Bill Gate. The post also claims that Bill Gate is planning to unleash the same military army on Nigeria, should the Buhari led-APC government fail to hand-over to Abubakar Atiku and Ifeanyi Okowa of PDP in 2023.  The 16-paragraph WhatsApp post with different links also insinuates that National Health Act 2014 was used to legalize human organs harvesting and human ovarian eggs poaching from Nigeria.  The post also alleged that the administration of former President Goodluck Jonathan was compelled by the Americans to sign the 2014 law, despite grave legal lacunae that risked the lives of millions of Nigerians, who would be killed for their organs in Nigerian hospitals. These hospitals were said to be owned by Bill Gates through proxies of a public-private partnership (PPP) arrangement.  Another part of the post suggests that the purported attacks by Bill Gates’ suspected terrorist mercenaries is to “create an outrage of persecution and killing of Christians in Nigeria, so that, their proxies would call for a UN peace-keeping force and create a decoy to formerly move-in the Blackwater private mercenaries that could topple the Buhari’s administration.” DUBAWA observed that the post has led to arguments giving room for people to believe in a conspiracy theory that America is trying to unleash terror in Africa. This was also sent in by different users for verification, prompting us to look into the claims.    Claim 1: ISWAP terrorists trained by Blackwater Private Army were responsible for the mass genocide in a Church in Owo in Southwestern Nigeria that left 40 victims dead.  Findings by DUBAWA, however, showed that Blackwater started out as a private security firm providing training support to law enforcement, the justice department, and military organizations.  Blackwater, now known as Academi LLC, was one of the private security firms used to guard officials, security guards, and military installations, train army and police forces, and provide other support for armed forces in Iraq, Afghanistan, Bosnia, and Israel. While Academi was used to fight against terrorism in some parts of the world, DUBAWA discovered that there was no sufficient evidence to connect the private security firm and ISWAP which took responsibility for the Owo attack.  Claim 2: Blackwater is a private army owned by Bill Gates and Monsanto  DUBAWA’s findings revealed that the Blackwater which is now known as Academi was founded by former Navy SEAL officer, Erik Prince.  Blackwater, renamed Xe Services in 2009 has been known as Academi since 2011, after it was acquired by a group of private investors. Further checks showed two large companies: Forte Capital Advisers and Manhattan Growth Products, now operate Academi.  It was gathered that Forte Capital Advisers is run by Jason DeYonker, who has several financial and personal connections to former Blackwater Founder, Erik Prince. Manhattan Growth Products on the other hand has controlling shares in many small corporations including Hugo Naturals, which manufactures all natural cleaning products and “vegan friendly soaps.” Findings also revealed that Monsanto Company, is a multinational chemical and agricultural biotechnology corporation that provides agricultural products for farmers. It is owned by Bayer AG with Hugh Grant as the CEO.  Dubawa’s checks discovered that Bill Gates was not a shareholder in the companies that acquire Academi and Monsanto Company as speculated in the WhatsApp post.  Claim 3: The National Health Act 2014 was used to legalize  harvesting of human organs and poaching of  human ovarian eggs from Nigeria.  When DUBAWA went through the National Health Act 2014, there was nowhere the legalization of human organs and ovarian eggs poaching was discussed.  A report by PREMIUM TIMES also revealed that the act is expected to impact on health-care access and universal health coverage, health-care cost, quality and standards, practice by health-care providers, as well as patient care and health outcomes.  Claim 4: The Act was pushed by Bill Gates and President Obama during the administration of President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, who insisted that he was compelled by the Americans to sign it.  DUBAWA’s check showed that the National Health Act was first proposed in 2004 during the time of Eyitayo Lambo as minister of health. It, however, took a decade of consideration before it was eventually passed and signed into law by former President Goodluck Jonathan on October 31, 2014 As against the post, former President Jonathan in 2021 said the National Health Bill and two others have remained dear to his heart.  Mr Jonathan, who also listed the Freedom of Information Bill and the Nigerian Local Content Bill, noted that the bills were special to him, despite signing numerous bills during his tenure as president.  Further search by DUBAWA using keywords showed that there was never a time the former president claimed the Americans  forced him to sign the National Health Act 2014.  Claim 5: Bill Gates has planned a military invasion of Nigeria should APC refuse to yield power to the PDP because Atiku and Okowa are the preferred candidates of Bill Gates.  DUBAWA was unable to ascertain if Bill Gates is supporting Atiku/Okowa’s Presidency.  There was insufficient evidence to substantiate the claim that the Billionaire is doing everything to ensure his candidates emerge victorious in the 2023 presidential election in Nigeria.  Three of the five claims in the WhatsApp post are false but there is insufficient evidence to support the other two claims. Good work. Keep the the good work going.

Claim: A WhatsApp video has a claim that bandits were roasted by lightning on their way to attack Christians in Zamfara state.,"In recent time, Nigeria has recorded killings perpetrated by terrorists. A church at Owo, Ondo State, and the ones that left three killed in Kaduna churches, prayers against banditry are not far-fetched from religious Nigerians.  Posing as an answer to these prayers is a video of burnt bodies that circulated on WhatsApp and Facebook. Accompanying the video is a claim that this footage is of bandits who were struck by lightning while on their way to attack some christians in Zamfara state. “It happened in Zamfara State yesterday. I was told the Bandits were going to attack some Christians on their way Lightning and Thunder struck and they were roasted beyond measure. Who told you there is no GOD?,”the message read.  This video has been forwarded many times on WhatsApp groups alongside the caption.  On Facebook, this same message has been shared by several users who believed it to be true. In the past, DUBAWA had found claims like this either false or misleading. Hence, the reason for this fact-check. As of the time of this verification, no media platform in Nigeria has reported that bandits were struck by lightning. Usually, such an event would make headlines in newspapers. Seeing it has not been reported is the first red flag. DUBAWA further observed that the viral claim neither stated the exact location of such happening in Zamfara nor disclosed the name of the Christian gathering the supposed bandits were planning to attack. Further checks revealed that the exact video has also been used by a blog to paint a similar narrative in 2021. However, like the recent ones, it did not say where such an event happened in Zamfara State. After watching the video in question, DUBAWA could see an explosion scene which clearly negates the narrative of “lightning” and “thunder.” Following that, a YouTube keyword search was conducted and among the many explosion videos that surfaced, a 2020 report by Al Jazeera and NTV Kenya was similar to the video being circulated. Al Jazeera reported that 60 people were feared dead after a tanker exploded in Morogoro town, Tanzania. The tanker had earlier fallen and “people came to take what they could. But then, disaster,” it said.  Al Jazeera also said that despite the help of emergency workers to save those that were caught up in the flames, it was too late and many were burnt beyond recognition. The motorcycles of people who came to collect fuel were also burnt. A side-by-side comparison of the circulating video and Al Jazeera’s report showed three similarities. Firstly, standing before the burning tanker are trees that have also been affected by the fire. Secondly, the tanker is lying in the same position as seen in the two videos. And thirdly, the two videos showed many burnt motorcycles. In order to determine which language was spoken by the people in the circulating video, DUBAWA reached out to Muhammad Auwal, an Hausa-speaking Nigerian to translate what the people in the video say. However, not able to comprehend what he heard, he doubted if the speakers were Hausas.  One of them responded, “I can’t actually understand what they are saying. Are you sure it is any of the Nigerian Languages? Is the scene Nigeria?” Likewise, Abba Adamu, a Hausa staff member of Daily Trust newspaper confirmed that the language spoken in the video was not Hausa. “It’s not Hausa,” he simply said after watching the video. Our findings show the video attached to the claim is from a tanker explosion that took place in Morogoro town of Tanzania, not anywhere in Nigeria. The claim is therefore misleading.

Claim: A Facebook user shared images of presidential aspirant Peter Obi with Pope Francis with the insinuation that the politician is meeting the clergyman for blessings ahead of the 2023 presidential election.,"Peter Obi, the presidential aspirant of the Labour Party (LP), like other presidential candidates, has continued to be the subject of conversation on social media platforms. Recently, a Facebook user, Victor Ifeanyi Ugwu, shared a picture of Pope Francis and Peter Obi with a note that the presidential aspirant met with Pope Francis for the “tasks ahead.” The claimant shared the images, with the caption “JUST IN…PETER OBI MEETS POPE FRANCIS,TO RECEIVE BLESSING FOR TASKS AHEAD..” Many other Facebook users, such as Boldoracle House, also have similar a claim on their pages. Although the author of the post didn’t specifically mention the 2023 election, commenters took the image as an endorsement from the pope. For instance, Victor Ifeanyi Ugwuw replied with a comment suggesting, “We Move an OBEdient servant towards ASO ROCK 2023.”  Another commenter said, “This is awesome” while Emmanuel Ebbi commented, “The movement is on..” Aya Goolu commented on Boldoracle House’s post, “Na jew go come vote for him na😃make he no forget Putin ooo”. DUBAWA chose to fact-check this claim to inform electorates about the actions of the presidential candidate as it can have a significant impact on the electorate’s decision. DUBAWA carried out a keyword search to ascertain if the presidential aspirant met with Pope Francis recently.  We found that The Eagle Online reported the meeting of Pope Francis and Peter Obi in 2018 when the latter was the vice presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party. However, the image attached to the story differs from the images shared by the claimant on Facebook. Hence, DUBAWA initiated a Google reverse image search of the images attached to the post by the claimant.  This led us to a tweet by Peter Obi in 2019. The tweet reads thus: “Nigeria continues to be underdeveloped because of the scant attention to education. I am excited to be working with the Pontifical Foundation Scholas Occurrentes, @InfoScholas, an initiative of @Pontifex, to bring development to our #education and #sports in Nigeria. -PO” The Herald also reported the meeting of the Pope and Peter Obi in 2019. As tweeted by Peter Obi, the purpose of the meeting with the Pope is to bring development to Nigeria’s education and sports sectors. We found that the images attached to the post date back to 2019 when Peter Obi met with Pope Francis. The images have nothing to do with  the supposed “tasks ahead” which many took to be the presidential election of 2023. Hence, the claim is false.

Elections in Nigeria continue to experience misinformation in different forms and the Ekiti governorship election is not expected to be an exception.,"Elections in Nigeria continue to experience misinformation in different forms and the Ekiti governorship election is not expected to be an exception. 749,065 (those who have collected their Permanent Voters Card as of June 13) out of 988,923 registered voters will choose who gets to run the affairs of the state for another four years.  16 political parties have presented candidates to contest this election which would take place at 2,445 polling units with 17,317 police personnel, 87 observer groups, 91 accredited media organisations, and 483 journalists.  Although six contestants have been identified as frontline contenders, the battle seems to be getting tougher between the candidates of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the Social Democratic Party (SDP). The election has already drawn the attention of misinformation vendors. Claims that the candidate of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), Segun Oni, stepped down for the All Progressives Congress (APC) and that the APC candidate was disqualified by the court have been recently fact-checked. DUBAWA in partnership with journalists and observers on ground will be running quick checks to debunk claims on the election. QUICK CHECKS Claim 1: A Twitter user, Nigeria News (@NaijaNews) shared pictures of a statement with the claim that the candidate of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), Segun Oni, has withdrawn from the governorship race.  Verdict: FALSE! In a telephone conversation, Segun Oni’s media aide, Jackson Adebayo, dismissed the claim as false. Claim2: A Twitter user, Nigeria News (@NaijaNews) claims INEC said it cannot stop vote-buying.  Verdict: MISLEADING! INEC’s National Commissioner, Festus Okoye’s comment on vote-buying when he appeared on Channels Television on Friday was taken out of context. He said “really the commission cannot as a commission guarantee there won’t be any vote buying in the election”. Claim3: A Twitter user Ekiti Trends (@ekititrends) claims party agents at the polling unit of former governor, Ayodele Fayose, engaged in fisticuffs. Verdict: TRUE! A Premium Times reporter confirmed to DUBAWA that party agents at Fayose’s Polling Unit 001, Ward 01, Irepodun Ifelodun LGA caused pandemonium over the voting queue.

"Claim: A post by Joe Igbokwe, a chieftain of All Progressives Congress (APC), shows a breakdown of votes reportedly scored by the former Lagos State Governor, Bola Tinubu, in each state at the just concluded presidential primary.","Following the emergence of Bola Tinubu as the flagbearer of APC for the 2023 presidential election, some social media users including a chieftain of APC in Lagos State have been circulating data to depict how delegates from each state voted for the former Lagos State governor.  Mr Tinubu during the primary polled 1271 votes to clinch the ticket ahead of former minister of transportation Rotimi Amaechi, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, Senate President Ahmad Lawan and other candidates. In the spirit of victory, some of Mr Tinubu’s supporters shared data to show the percentage of votes the former governor got from delegates from each state. The data which was broken into the six geopolitical zones had different states with different percentages of votes.  While some users believe the data to be genuine, others questioned Mr Igbokwe’s source, prompting DUBAWA to fact-check. DUBAWA discovered that only elected national and Ad-hoc delegates were qualified to vote at the National convention. A total of 2, 260 delegates were accredited for the election.  One of the video clips of the election obtained by DUBAWA showed that the delegates cast their votes in any of the 40 ballot boxes made available at the convention ground.  DUBAWA observed that none of the ballot boxes were dedicated to any state; hence it is difficult to determine the delegates that voted for each candidate.  It was also observed that the election was a secret ballot where delegates were allowed to choose their preferred candidate without others knowing.  Cambridge dictionary defines secret ballot “as a method of voting in which each person writes their choice on a piece of paper so that no one else knows how they have voted.” A close observation of the video of the voting exercise for the APC presidential primary shows that it is impossible to determine the percentage of people that voted for Tinubu in each state because the delegates were dropping their votes secretly in different ballots boxes.  The post showing a breakdown of how delegates in each state voted for Bola Tinubu is false. DUBAWA discovered that the election was a secret ballot and votes were not tallied on a state-by-state basis.

Claim: WhatsApp users claim that INEC has scheduled a PVC registration concert for June 20 to 25 at Eagle square.,"Claim: WhatsApp users claim that INEC has scheduled a PVC registration concert for June 20 to 25 at Eagle square.  Our findings show a voter registration campaign and concert will be held in Abuja from June 20 to June 25, 2022. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in collaboration with YIAGA Africa and the European Union held a Permanent Voter Card (PVC) registration concert at the Tafawa Balewa Square Lagos on Saturday, June 12, 2022.  This was preceded by a Youth Vote Count campaign from Monday, June 6 to Friday, June 10, 2022. This campaign was designed to mobilise citizens, especially the youth to participate in the electoral process.  Recently, different WhatsApp users took to their status to announce that INEC is set to hold a similar concert at the Eagle Square in Abuja from June 20-25. A keyword search on Google led to reports announcing the concert in Lagos by The Guardian, The Nation, Vanguard and Business Day but nothing on a concert in Abuja. We also did not find any announcement of a concert in Abuja on INEC’s Twitter account and website, so we reached out to INEC’s commissioner for information and voter education, Festus Okoye.  He confirmed this was true, explaining that the concert will be held on Saturday, June 25, after voter registration which will commence from Monday, June 20 to Friday, June 24.  “The PVC registration concert will begin on Monday, June 20, 2022, and the concert will take place on Saturday, June 25, 2022, at Eagle Square Abuja”. This was also announced by Yiaga Africa (@YIAGA) in a tweet Tuesday afternoon with the same details shared by INEC’s commissioner.

"Claim: A video, which has been widely circulated on social media, shows some men and women chanting and dancing while wielding guns. The caption of the video suggests that some Fulani women were equipped with guns and other ammunition to attack Yoruba people in different parts of Nigeria.","On Sunday, June 5, some gunmen attacked worshippers at the St Francis Catholic Church in Owo town of Ondo State. While the police are yet to identify those behind the attack, the federal government has pinned the attack on the Islamist State of West Africa Province (ISWAP), although without evidence. Five days after the attack, there were reports on social media that the attackers were arrested. The Ondo State Police Command, however, denied the arrest of the suspected terrorists. But there have been debates in Nigeria on who was responsible, with some people claiming it was perpetrated by people of the Fulani ethnic group.  Following the Owo church attack, a Facebook page posted a 30-seconds video with a caption written in Yoruba, suggesting that Fulani women were armed to attack the Yoruba. The English version of the post reads:  “Please take note, the Fulani are giving guns to their women to kill Yoruba people. We need to pray that we don’t have all these political jobbers again. We need to let political jobbers know that there won’t be an election in Yorubaland! Our safety is paramount at this point. #Freedom #Yorubanation.” Going through comments on the post, it was observed that many people believe the Fulani were actually trying to attack Yoruba people as claimed in the post.  One respondent, Oluwasegun Adegbule, questioned the authorities on why non-state actors are allowed to go about with guns.  “Who owns those rifles, is it the police, the military, or any of these paramilitary personnel, and the president says any unauthorized person or persons carrying Ak47 rifles should be arrested, this is purely double standard law,” the Facebook user wrote.  The recent Owo killings have left many Nigerians in fear, making people vulnerable to all sorts of manipulated information. This alleged video is a typical example of multiple users that commented on the video, showing signs of anxiety and tension, that give Dubawa a reason to verify the claim.  DUBAWA conducted a frame-by-frame analysis of the video on the InVid Video verification tool.  Results from the analysis show that the earliest version of the video appeared online on 12th March 2022 in a Facebook post that describes itself  as “raising disciples, training indigenous missionaries involved in rehabilitation of destitute Children.”  This version of the post was captioned to have condemned the “gun display” by the women, describing it as foolish and barbaric.  Part of the caption reads: “Why can’t these dancing women be educated for future building!!! The community leaders should be arrested immediately.” Going through the 3:20-seconds video, DUBAWA discovered that the chanting and dancing appear to be a festival of a tribe outside Nigeria.  Apparently, shreds of evidence gathered find the people in the footage to be of the  Afar ethnic people scattered across Ethiopia, Eritrea and Djibouti. The Afar people have clamoured for an independent nation called “Afarria” or the “Afar Triangle,”  for almost half a century.  These people wielding rifles in the footage are evidently the “Afar People’s Force,” a guerrilla army that has been in the forefront of the struggle. The woman holding the microphone is noticed to have the flag of the Afar nationality fixed to her scarf as she dances and sings. The Afar flag has a red triangle with three horizontal stripes of blue, white and green.  In the same footage, officers of the Afar Regional National State Police are seen standing amidst the crowd.  DUBAWA also noticed that the “Afar People’s Force (APF)” is active on Facebook and has shared multiple videos of men and women of the tribe wielding rifles while dancing and singing. In one of such videos shared on Facebook in March 2021, titled: “APF: Afar People’s Force” officers are also seen in the scene.  Although DUBAWA could not trace other sources of the alleged footage, findings from the in-depth analysis suggest the event presented in the video took place in the Afar Region of Ethiopia, Eastern Africa and not in Nigeria as claimed.  The post claiming some Fulani women were armed with guns to attack Yoruba people in different parts of Nigeria is misleading as DUBAWA discovered the event took place in the Afar Region of Ethiopia, Eastern Africa, not in Nigeria as alleged ",MISLEADING,14/06/2022,https://dubawa.org/video-shot-in-ethiopia-falsely-used-to-project-attack-on-yoruba-in-nigeria/
"Claim: A video circulating on social media, especially on WhatsApp suggests that northern governors of the All Progressives Congress (APC) visited Atiku Abubakar, the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Wednesday, shortly after the emergence of Bola Tinubu as the APC presidential candidate.","Barely 24 hours after Bola Tinubu, former governor of Lagos State, emerged as the flagbearer of the ruling APC, some social media users started circulating a video suggesting that northern governors met with PDP candidate, Abubakar Atiku.  In the 29 seconds video, Atiku was captured in a room with the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, Yobe State Governor, Maimala Buni, Katsina State Governor, Aminu Bello Masari and Jigawa State Governor, Mohammed Badaru, among others. The text that accompanied the video alleged conspiracy against Mr Tinubu by the northern APC leaders following his emergence as the party’s flagbearer.  The video was captioned: “Northern APC governors and Senate President went to visit Atiku. These are people that just handed the ticket of their party to Bola Tinubu and in less than 24 hours they are flocking together with the flag bearer of an opposition party.  “If this is not a conspiracy then tell me what it is. They collected all his dollar, gave him ticket and turned their backs immediately 🤔😅. We are just being played for fools!” DUBAWA observed that some Nigerians believed the video, as someone who reacted to it on a Whatsapp group insisted that many northern leaders will dump APC for PDP.  DUBAWA conducted a frame by frame analysis of the video on the InVid Video verification tool.  Results from the analysis show that the earliest version of the video first surfaced on the internet on 22nd January 2022 when Atiku paid a condolence visit to the family of Dahiru Mangal, a business magnate in Katsina, who lost his 85-year-old mother. Dahiru Mangal is the Chairman of Afdin Group, owners of Max Air, Afdin Petroleum, Afdin Construction, among others. Further checks by DUBAWA led to a tweet by the PDP presidential candidate posted on his verified Twitter handle on the condolence visit to the Katsina business magnate.  The tweet read, “Earlier today (January 22), I paid a condolence visit to Alhaji Dahiru Mangal in Katsina over the loss of his beloved mother and matriarch of their family, Hajiya Murja Bara’u. I pray that Almighty Allah will comfort the family and grant her Aljannah Firdaus in Paradise.” Close observation by DUBAWA shows that images in the pictures correlate with shots from the video. All persons in the video are dressed just as depicted in the images. The post alleging that APC northern governors visited Atiku after the emergence of Bola Tinubu as the APC presidential candidate is misleading. DUBAWA discovered that the event took place early this year during a condolence visit to the family of Dahiru Mangal, a businessman in Katsina.

Claim: Ultrasounds are recommended instead of MRIs because MRIs show scary images of babies.,"An Instagram page for new mums @wives_and_mothers shared the screenshot of a tweet with the claim that MRIs show scary images of babies and that is why pregnant women get ultrasounds.  The post shared with the caption “What? Just leave our ultrasound for us Abeg,” left several users in its comment section stunned.  “Fun fact of the day: the reason pregnant people get ultrasounds and not MRIs, is that in an MRI, this is what the foetus looks like,” the tweet in the screenshot read.  Does this tweet exist? Was this claim made? If the tweet exists, is the claim true or not? These questions prompted us to verify the claim.  To establish this screenshot was from an actual tweet, we searched Twitter and found the original tweet by fronk (@dhomochameleon).  In the comment section, he said he first heard of this on TikTok and provided a link to the TikTok video. The speaker in the video said the scary images are apparently the reason why doctors use ultrasound for pregnant women, not MRI. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive imaging technology that produces three-dimensional detailed anatomical images. Most MRI machines are large, tube-shaped magnets.  When you lie inside an MRI machine, the magnetic field temporarily realigns water molecules in your body. Radio waves then cause these aligned atoms to produce faint signals, which are used to create cross-sectional MRI images.  On the other hand, diagnostic ultrasound, also called sonogram or diagnostic medical sonography, is an imaging method that uses sound waves to produce images of structures within the body. The images can provide valuable information for diagnosing and directing treatment for a variety of diseases and conditions. An ultrasound allows your doctor to see problems with organs, vessels, and tissues without needing to make an incision. Because ultrasound does not use radiation like other imaging techniques, it’s the preferred method for viewing a developing foetus during pregnancy.   Most people associate ultrasound scans with pregnancy because it is the most common imaging exam used during pregnancy, but it has many other uses like viewing the bladder and brain (in infants). This article notes that MRIs are requested when ultrasound does not provide a clear answer, or if other parts of your body need to be imaged,  A keyword search on what an MRI scan of a baby looks like showed similar images. Articles here, here, and here also show similar MRI images of babies.  A senior registrar at the National Hospital Abuja, Jeremiah Agim, confirmed MRI images of babies look like this but that is not the reason doctors use ultrasounds. “Yes they look like this on MRI. The look is not the reason for the choice of ultrasound scan. That’s false,”  said the registrar. He explained MRIs have a better soft tissue delineation than ultrasound scans and are often used in pregnancy as an adjunct when additional information is required after an ultrasound scan.  He also noted, “MRI is very expensive, the movement of the foetus might reduce image quality and it takes a longer time to do it than an ultrasound scan.” Okpanachi Achile, a medical officer at  Rehoboth Specialist Hospital Lokoja, also agrees that the kind of image MRIs show is not the reason ultrasounds are used for pregnant women. “MRI is actually more detailed than ultrasound but not routinely done for pregnancy. But this can’t be the main reason ultrasound is preferred. Ultrasound is cheaper,  accessible and can give most information you would require.” A gynaecologist at Garki Hospital Abuja, Sunday Idoko, also noted that MRI images look like this but that is not the reason for the use of ultrasound.  “Yeah, it looks true. But of course they will tone it down to make it look more scary,” he said.  Speaking on the cost, the gynaecologist said an MRI costs N65,000, questioning why a person will choose to do an MRI for a baby when an ultrasound will do a good job. “Ultrasound even gives you the advantage to do Doppler studies (the study of the heart and vessels),” he added. While it is true MRIs show scary images of babies, it is not the reason ultrasounds are recommended for pregnant women. This claim is, therefore, misleading.

Claim: A Facebook user claims the Ghanian government has introduced uniforms for its school teachers.,"For reasons such as equality, safety and sense of belonging, the concept of school uniform among primary and secondary schools in Africa has come to stay. Uniforms are the clothing students are required to wear at school. Schools often have specific styles and colours, “to identify students as attending a particular institution.” Unlike students, school teachers in Africa are, however, rarely seen wearing school uniforms. Rather, they adopt corporate dresses as their dress code. This claim surprisingly indicates that the Ghana government has implemented the wearing of school uniforms by teachers. The post was shared by this Facebook user. The post, accompanied by the post are pictures of some women and a man kitted in dull peach-coloured shirts and deep brown skirts and trousers, went viral and even resurfaced on Twitter. The chest pocket of the shirts reads ‘Ghana Education Service.’ The post, which has been widely shared and retweeted, has also caused controversial debates among users who saw the uniform as “unacceptable” and those who regarded it as ‘a welcomed development.’ Reacting to the claim, Alice Chobola, a Facebook user, condemned the government’s act, saying it was not right for teachers to wear uniforms. She wrote: “Wrong of Ghana to do that. Nurses wear uniforms, patients own clothes, so pupils wear uniforms, teachers own clothes, Epela.” However, unlike Alice, Mavis Mulundano said introducing school uniforms to teachers will curb secret activities performed by them during school hours. She wrote, “It can be a very good idea in Zambia so as to reduce the number of teachers who go drinking during working hours for fear of being spotted in uniform.” It is due to this virality that DUBAWA decided to conduct a fact check. DUBAWA first conducted a Google keyword search and discovered that the claim has also been published by this blog, this blog, and this blog. However, it was not reported by any credible news platform. DUBAWA then contacted Cassandra Twum, the Public Relations Officer for Ghana Education Service. Bluntly but clearly, she discredited the claim, saying:  “Oh but this is an old fake story. Disregard! not true.”  Furthermore, DUBAWA also spoke with Kwasi Kwarteng, the Spokesperson of Ghana Ministry of Education who also debunked the news, saying in a WhatsApp chat: “The Ghana Education Service has not approved of any uniform/attire for its teachers.” The Public Relations Officer for Ghana Ministry of Education and the Spokesperson, Ghana Ministry of Education, have debunked the news. The circulating claim that the Ghana government asked its teachers to wear uniforms to work is, therefore, false. ",FALSE,07/06/2022,https://dubawa.org/ghana-did-not-introduce-uniform-for-teachers/
Claim: A WhatsApp user claims online voter registration has been extended till June 30.,"Following the date extension for party primaries, the Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) called on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to extend the deadline for voter registration.  SERAP, which threatened to sue the commission if this is not done, said this will give Nigerians more time to exercise their rights.   Amidst this, a WhatsApp user on Thursday, June 2, 2022, shared a screenshot on his WhatsApp status with the claim that online voter registration had been extended.  The user shared this while urging the public to go and get their Permanent Voters Card (PVC). This screenshot with the message “PVC registration; INEC extends online Registration to June 30! Please you have no excuse now,” carries the link to INEC’s Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) portal.  The public needs the right information about voter registration, hence the need for this fact-check  A visit to INEC’s CVR portal showed an important notice that online registration ended May 30, 2022, while the CVR continues till June 30.  Is online registration different from CVR? No, it is not. The CVR process involves voter registration (first by pre-registering online and completing it physically with biometric capturing), transfer of registered voters, change of registered voter details, and removal of registration details.  Online registration is just a part of the CVR process that involves the applicant entering his/her details and scheduling an appointment for biometric capture. DUBAWA reached out to INEC’s commissioner for information and voter education, Festus Okoye, for clarification. Mr Okoye said offline registration continues till June 30, 2022 and those who have corrections to make can do that online but online registration or pre-registration has ended.  “The physical offline registration ends on the 30th day of June 2022. The online pre-registration has ended,” he said. “However, those that want to transfer or those with lost or defaced PVCs can still go online and make corrections,” he added.  The chief press secretary to the INEC chairman, Rotimi Oyekanmi, also confirmed that online registration was not extended.  “The CVR has not been extended. The online pre-registration ended on May 30. But physical registration is still open till June 30,” he confirmed.  The claim that online registration has been extended is false and misleading as online registration ended May 30, 2022. Only physical registration is still ongoing and that is what will end June 30, 2022. So if you have not entered your details and scheduled a date for biometric capturing, you can no longer do that.

"Claim: A video, which has been widely circulated, on social media shows how a police officer attacked and brought down a gun-wielding man. Many social media users circulating the video claim it was shot in Owo, Ondo state, where unknown gunmen attacked and killed worshippers in a Catholic church on Sunday.","On 5th June, 2022, tragedy struck in St Francis Catholic Church, Owa-luwa Street, in Owo town, Owo Local Government Area of Ondo State when assailants attacked the church and killed scores of worshippers. Gory videos from the crime scene had since surfaced on social media.  Although the Police said they are yet to identify those behind the attack, many social media users are alleging that suspected Fulani herdsmen were responsible for the massacre that has left a yet-to-be-confirmed number of people dead. While Nigeria was thrown into a mourning state, some social media users have started circulating a video claiming that one of the attackers was apprehended hours after the attack.  In the video, it was claimed that a brave Nigerian police officer brought down one of the Ondo Church attackers. A Facebook user posted the video with a caption: “Brave policeman caught up with one of them. He looks like a foreigner.”  Going through comments on the post, it was observed that while some users believe the incident actually happened in Owo, some were quick to debunk and query the source of the video.  While Jide Fashakin thinks the policeman ‘deserve a national honour for his bravery act’,  Ikechukwu Stanley Okafor said the event was reported to have occurred in Togo and not Nigeria.  “This is not Nigeria and never Owo town. This is Togo allegedly (sic),” he wrote. DUBAWA decided to fact-check this for security reasons as assailants might still be in the vicinity of the attack. DUBAWA conducted a frame by frame analysis of the video using InVid, a verification tool. A reversed image search on one of the results shows that the video had appeared on the internet before the Owo church incident.  The earliest version of the video was posted on Twitter on 3rd June, 2020 in a tweet by Raissa Nouradine Kassire. The caption was written in French.  The English version of the post reads: “A Chadian trader residing in Togo 🇹🇬 killed a gendarme and injured a policeman who tried to control him. The incident happened at the market, the crowd later lynched the criminal, we regret this despicable act. Sincere condolences to the families and the Togolese people.” A closer look of the uniform the police officer was putting on also shows that it is not the Nigerian Police outfit.  A further search by DUBAWA showed that the police uniform is the same with the Togo Police Force.  DUBAWA also traced a report on the incident on a Togo news website. The headline reads: “A young Chadian stabs a gendarme to death and wounds a policeman.” Reading through the report, it was discovered the incident reportedly took place at the big market in Lomé, not far from Marox in Togo.  The post claiming that a Police officer attacked and brought down a gun-wielding man in the Owo incident is misleading as DUBAWA discovered that it was not recorded in Nigeria and has nothing to do with the incident.

Claim: Coconut water stops diarrhea.,"Coconut water has become a trendy beverage, not just because it is sweet and hydrating but also because it has several nutritional value. Coconut water comes from the juice found inside coconuts. It is mostly water but contains important nutrients not found in ordinary water. Recently, a Facebook post by Aduramingba herbal remedies claims coconut water stops diarrhea.  This post directs that babies below six months of age be given two spoonfuls of coconut water every six hours while babies above six months be given four spoonfuls of coconut water. For children between one to two years of age, the post recommended a quarter of coconut water and half a glass cup for children above two years.  “Administer Cocos nucifera (coconut) water to a child to stop frequent stooling, diarrhoea and dysentery,” part of the Facebook post read.  Diarrhea, a term for having loose and watery stools, usually three or more times in a day can occur due to illnesses like stomach flu, gastrointestinal diseases, food poisoning, medications, etc.  Diarrhea causes significant fluid and electrolyte loss from the body which can lead to dehydration. Although it is the second leading cause of death in children under five years old, it is preventable and treatable. Coconut water has been identified as a natural source of minerals that helps with dehydration which is why many people drink coconut water when they are dehydrated or have diarrhea.  Its potassium, sodium, magnesium, and calcium content act as electrolytes that help maintain fluid balance in the body. The number of electrolytes in coconut water, however, depends on whether it was obtained from young or mature coconuts and may vary across brands. Mature coconuts tend to have higher amounts of electrolytes than young ones. It is, however, important to note that coconut water can also contribute to diarrhea in some people in case of consumption of excess potassium. Having seen the relationship between diarrhea and coconut water, we sought to know if coconut water is appropriate and safe for babies or not. This article which highlights some benefits of coconut water warns against giving babies under six months coconut water because of the risk of allergic reactions.  Another article by parenting.first cry.com concurs with this, noting that coconut water is beneficial but should only be given after the first six months of life. A senior registrar at the National Hospital Abuja, Jeremiah Agim, explained that coconut water is one of the home remedies for  diarrhea disease with the aim of replacing fluid lost through stooling.  He identified other home remedies to be garri water and rice water but noted that all these remedies including ORS are not used solely for the  treatment of dysentery. “Antibiotics are required if a diagnosis of dysentery is made,” he said.  He added that the dose recommended by this post is wrong, noting it should be administered like the ORS:  “The dosing as stated here, using coconut water is also not right. The water should be administered like ORS based on whether the child is dehydrated or not, which the pediatrician will  prescribe.” He, however, warned that this is not what would be recommended at the hospital unless that is the only thing the patient can afford.  “Don’t go to the hospital expecting the doctor to ask you to give your child garri, rice or coconut water. Like I said, they are home remedies, not what  a paediatrician will offer to a child. This can only be advised if they can not afford ORS.” Alabi Olukayode, a paediatrician at Cedarcrest hospital Abuja, said there is no scientific basis for this remedy and it can delay the proper management of diarrhea and dysentery.  “There is no scientific basis to use this herbal remedy. Most common causes of diarrhea in children are viruses and cases of dysentery which are caused by virulent bacteria.  “Coconut water as a natural remedy to diarrhea and dysentery is not encouraged. This method of treatment will delay the proper management of diarrhea and dysentery leading to life-threatening complications,” he said.  Also, a medical officer at  Rehoboth Specialist Hospital in Lokoja, Okpanachi Achile, said he can’t say if coconut water stops diarrhea but he knows it is prescribed as an alternative to Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS).  “I’ve not done any research on this but it’s prescribed as an alternative to ORS,” he added.  Our findings and experts’ comments show this claim is misleading. Coconut water is only used in relation to diarrhea for rehydration, not as a cure or something that can stop it.  Also, we found no study or report that identifies coconut water as a solution to diarrhea.  ",MISLEADING,03/06/2022,https://dubawa.org/is-it-true-coconut-water-stops-diarrhea/

We visited Azman airline website to find a price list for its Kaduna-Abuja flight but found none; we then attempted booking a flight to see the amount that will pop up, but we found Lagos and Kano as the only option from Kaduna on Azman airline.  We subjected the screenshot to analysis using Forensically but saw no sign of manipulation.  We then sent an enquiry message to the email address available on the airline’s website but it bounced back.  We spoke to an official of the airline identified as Kabir Tukur who said this was true as the airline has again closed flights for that route. “It is true that the cost was ₦100,000 for the one day or two days that it operated. It has been closed since then,” he said. Speaking on the duration of the flight, Tukur added that ideally a Kaduna-Abuja flight should take at least 30 minutes but this takes more time because the plane has to fly Kaduna to Lagos then to Abuja.”  The claim that Azman Airline’s Kaduna-Abuja flight costs ₦100,000 is true. An official of Azman airline confirmed this was the cost of the flight for the few days it operated after reopening. The flight has, however, been closed again.

Claim: Russian defence ministry claims that the West African Monkeypox variant originated from Nigeria.,"Recently, Russia’s Ministry of Defence released a report it described as the results of an analysis the ministry conducted. In the report, Russia’s defence ministry claimed that the West African strain of Monkeypox from Nigeria, citing a World Health Organisation (WHO) report  “According to a WHO report, the introduction of the West African strain of the monkeypox pathogen originated from Nigeria, another state in which the United States has deployed its biological infrastructure,” the ministry said.  Monkeypox is a viral zoonosis (a virus transmitted to humans from animals) with symptoms similar to those seen in the past in smallpox patients, though clinically less severe.  The WHO has published two reports on monkeypox  that have direct mentions of Nigeria. The first is titled “Monkeypox” and was published on 19th  May, 2022. The second report titled “Multi-country monkeypox outbreak in non-endemic countries” was published on 21st May 2022. While both reports indicated the presence of the West African clade Monkeypox, none of the reports mentioned that it originated in Nigeria.  In the first report, “Monkeypox,” Nigeria is pinpointed to have experienced a large outbreak of an unspecified type of Monkeypox. “Since 2017, Nigeria has experienced a large outbreak, with over 500 suspected cases and over 200 confirmed cases and a case fatality ratio of approximately 3%. Cases continue to be reported until today.” The report further indicates that the first report of Monkeypox outside Africa was in the US, with sources from Ghana and The Gambia. “In 2003, the first monkeypox outbreak outside of Africa was in the United States of America and was linked to contact with infected pet prairie dogs. These pets had been housed with Gambian pouched rats and dormice that had been imported into the country from Ghana. This outbreak led to over 70 cases of monkeypox in the U.S.” The report further added that Monkeypox (unspecified) was subsequently found in travellers from Nigeria to Israel, the UK, the US, and Singapore.  “Monkeypox has also been reported in travellers from Nigeria to Israel in September 2018, to the United Kingdom in September 2018, December 2019, May 2021 and May 2022, to Singapore in May 2019, and to the United States of America in July and November 2021. In May 2022, multiple cases of monkeypox were identified in several non-endemic countries.” Monkeypox endemic countries are: Benin, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gabon, Ghana (identified in animals only), Côte d’Ivoire, Liberia, Nigeria, the Republic of the Congo, and Sierra Leone. Benin and South Sudan have documented importations in the past.  Nonetheless, the reports say that countries currently reporting cases of the West African clade are Cameroon and Nigeria. Even if this was the material  the Russian Ministry of Defence was referring to, further data presented on the same report, specifically on “cases of Monkeypox in endemic countries  between 15th December 2021 to May 2022” showed that Cameroon had reported cases of Monkeypox before Nigeria.  Although Nigeria is widely mentioned as a country with cases of Monkeypox in both reports, it should be noted that none of them specifically insinuated or specifically mentioned the West African variant originated in Nigeria.  Looking closely, the statement from the Russian Defence Ministry seems to lack accuracy and reliability. “According to a WHO report, the introduction of the West African strain of the monkeypox pathogen originated from Nigeria.” The statement failed to mention the title of the WHO report,  failed to provide a quote, failed to state when the WHO report was released, and even failed to provide a link or reference to the said WHO report.  Dr Desu from the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) clarified that the origin of the West African variant of the Monkeypox has not been categorically  stated. “Nobody can categorically say where the West African variant of the Monkeypox originated from. Although the variant resurfaced in Nigeria in 2017,  there is no available literature that says where it originated from.” The claim by the Russian defence ministry that the West African Monkeypox variant originated from Nigeria is misleading. There is no such WHO report that said categorically the West African variant of the Monkeypox originated from Nigeria.

Claim: A user on Facebook claims unknown gunmen in Abuja have chased away security men on the boundary between Nigeria and other countries.,"A user on Facebook shares footage  of a crowd running from an apparent danger.  The footage is posted alongside a narrative that claims an  ongoing tension between security men and some unknown gunmen in Abuja, the capital of Nigeria.  “Nigeria Falling Apart; breaking:  unknown gunmen in Abuja chase security men away from the boundary between Nigeria’s neighbouring countries. With heavy multiple gunshot.. Shame On #BBC fake News Media, Journalists Without soul #FreeBiafra #FreeNnamdiKanuNow #EndNigeria #SaveLives https://t.co/lrGW6YHDRc,” the post read.” The same post was also shared on Twitter by the same user, Samuel Henry Okonkwo with the tag #freeBiafra, #endNigeria, etc. The post has attracted multiple views across both Facebook and Twitter.  This is not the first time DUBAWA has fact checked false claims from this particular user, especially around contents that are Pro-Biafran.  The Biafran separatist group, also known as the Independent People of Biafra (IPOB) have been clamouring for an independent state since 1966. This  led to the Nigerian civil war that started in  1966 to 1970, causing the death of millions of lives.  Many years later, the war seemed to have  planted a seed of mistrust between the people of Igbo extraction in the southeastern part of Nigeria and those of Hausa-Fulani extraction from the north, which is still growing sporadically.  Consequently this alleged video maybe a ticking time bomb, particularly with the recent violence that had erupted in Dei Dei, a satellite area in Abuja, over the death of an Igbo woman who fell from a taxi motorcycle driven by a Hausa man.  Verification  When DUBAWA ran a frame fragmentation of the alleged video on InVid video verifier, the results revealed the alleged footage has been in circulation since 2020.  Apparently, this is not the first time the footage is used to spread disinformation.  In 2020, during the Edo gubernatorial elections,  the video was falsely  used to depict an ongoing electoral violence in Benin City, Edo state.    Originally, the video was captured in Ivory Coast back in 2020,  when citizens took to the streets to kick against   Alassane Ouattara’s bid to contest for a third term in office as president.  The footage was filmed during the unrest  and was tweeted by France-based media outlet LSi Africa on August 7, 2020, that same day.  Noticeably, the claimant alleged the scenario took place in Abuja and the security men were chased by the unknown gunmen to neighbouring countries. This statement is contradictory and lacks credibility because Abuja, the capital of Nigeria, is in the centre of the country and does not share boundaries with any other country.  The video used to depict the alleged narrative was taken from a different context that took place in Ivory Coast and not in Abuja, Nigeria. This claim is false.

"Claim: A Facebook post claims the husband of the popular gospel singer, Osinachi Nwachukwu, has been sentenced to death.","Peter Nwachukwu was in the news in April following the death of his wife, Osinachi Nwachukwu. It was alleged that the battery by Mr. Nwachukwu, who is also the manager of the gospel singer, led to her death.  The Attorney-General of the Federation recently filed a 23-count charge against Peter Nwachukwu. A Facebook post in a private Facebook group, Tell It Moms, claimed Mr Nwachukwu had been sentenced to death by hanging. This post by King-Aki zipping-Attah, a member of the group, was credited to Caleb Nii Boi. Screenshots of the post were also shared on WhatsApp, where DUBAWA received a copy. We first tried to find the source of the claim but seeing the Facebook group is a private one, we decided to conduct a search on the name (Caleb Nii Boi) quoted. This search showed several other Facebook users like Paakwesiforson.com, Victoria Beeka Danso, and Chineye Sunita Matthew who have shared this claim too, crediting the same source.  A keyword search led to news reports by Legit.ng,International Centre for Investigative Reporting (ICIR), and the Cable, on the possible death sentence pending for Mr. Nwachukwu.  The charge against him was filed under sections 104 and 379 of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act, 2015 and culpable homicide contrary to section 221 of the Penal Code which is punishable with death. The charge with number, CR/199/2022, was filed at the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, on May 20, 2022, by the Head, Sexual and Gender-Based Violence, Department of Public Prosecutions of the Federation, Ministry of Justice, Yewande Gbola-Awopetun. The 23-count charge against Mr Nwachukwu, is that of culpable homicide but a sentence is yet to be passed.  Mr Peter Nwachukwu has only been charged to court for culpable homicide not sentenced to death as claimed by some Facebook users. Reports on this possible death sentence are just predictions following the 23-count charge against him. I need you today, tomorrow, every day of my life.

Claim: A user on Facebook claims that a Dutch national has declared an interest in contesting for governor of Plateau State in Nigeria.,"The 2023 general elections in Nigeria is perhaps the major event most Nigerians are looking up to. Already, the social media space in the nation is going wild with diverse discourses around the upcoming elections.  One user on Facebook even claims that a Dutch international has declared interest to contest as governor of Plateau State in the upcoming 2023 general elections in Nigeria. The user shared the post alongside a poster of the alleged contestant named, Yohanna Maigona, AKA “Sarkin Bature Plateau” who is said to be contesting under the All for All People’s Party. In the narrative accompanied by the poster, the user states that the real name of the Dutch national is Wieber Boer, but Yohanna Maigona is his Nigerian name because he was born and bred in Jos, the capital of Plateau State.  “A Dutch International has declared an interest in contesting for governor of Plateau state. His real name is Wieber Boer, he’s a dutch. Yohanna Maigona is his Nigerian name. He was born in Jos, he schooled in Jos too. He said he has the solution to take Plateau state out of the woods.What do you think???”  The post attracted over a thousand reactions, with multiple comments and several re-shares. One user, Idowu Osoba,  unhappy with the news, admitted that the alleged candidate would not be any better to the Nigerian politician if he had lived in Jos.  “If all the life he lived in Jos and Nigeria, count me out because he will behave like Nigerian politicians.” Other users felt the same, insinuating he may even be worse than the Nigerian politicians.   “Dude may be Dutch and white, but can still be a pro max of Nigerian politicians, considering his early environment and current disposition — psychodynamically,” Dahal commented.  Plateau is the twelfth-largest state in Nigeria. It is approximately in the centre of the country and regionally in the North-central part of Nigeria. On the website of the “All On,”  an energy innovation company with a mission  to increase access to commercial energy products and services for under-served and unserved off-grid energy markets in Nigeria, Wieber Boer is presented as the Chief Executive Officer of All On. Other details provided about him showed he “joined the team from the Boston Consulting Group (BCG), where he was one of the founders of the strategy firm’s Lagos office.  Prior to BCG, Dr. Boer spent five years with the Heirs Holdings Group in Lagos, playing roles, including Chief of Staff to the Chairman, Director of Strategy, and CEO of the Tony Elumelu Foundation.” “He spent one year studying political science at the University of Jos, and completed his primary and secondary education at Hillcrest School, also in Jos, Nigeria, where he was born and raised.” So far, there are no reports online about Mr Boer’s intentions to run for the office of Governor in Plateau State. Even more, Mr Boer has debunked the claims on his LinkedIn page,  where he “categorically” stated that he had no intentions to contest for any political office in Nigeria.   “It has come to my attention that posters implying that I am running for Governor of Plateau State under the name of Yohanna Maigona have gone viral. I am categorically stating that I have no intention of running for political office in Nigeria, and I am not eligible to do so.” Mr Boer confirmed that he was truly born in Jos and raised in Taraba State.  “The only truth to the insinuation is that I was born in Jos and raised in Taraba and Plateau states to Dutch missionary parents and have spent the last 12 years living in Lagos and serving Nigeria and Nigerians in various capacities. I have always been a staunch believer in the potential of Nigeria and will continue to support the country’s development from the sidelines,” Boer stated.  Additionally, there is no such political party as “All for All People’s Party” in Nigeria. This was apparently created to misinform Nigerians.  Although the acclaimed  Dutch national was truly raised and bred in Nigeria. The claim that he intends to run as governor of Plateau state is false.

"Claim: National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) 2022 report shows 92% of Nigerians earn less than ₦60,000","Claim: National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) 2022 report shows 92% of Nigerians earn less than ₦60,000 This claim is false as our findings show there is no 2022 report by the NBS on labour force statistics and previous reports do not state the amount earned by workers in Nigeria. The Nigerian population is divided  into the labour force (currently active) and non‐labour force (currently inactive). While unemployment and under-employment are sometimes used interchangeably, they do not mean the same thing.   The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) describes an employed person as one who is engaged in the production of goods and services, thereby contributing to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in a legitimate manner and an unemployed person as one with absolutely nothing to do or did something but for less than 20 hours during the reference week. Underemployment occurs when a person works less than full time hours (40 hours) but works at least 20 hours on average a week and /or if the person works full time he or she is engaged in an activity that under-utilised their skills, time and educational qualifications. A Twitter user Ustashi Jake (@Hitee_)  in April, claimed  92% of Nigerians earn less than ₦60,000 a month and credited this to the NBS. “Over 92% of Nigerians earn less than 60k a month- NBS 2022” the tweet read. Looking at how and when the NBS releases its quarterly report, we found this suspicious because the claimant attributed this to a 2022 report by the NBS. Also, users in the comment section of the tweet did not believe this claim as some took to the comment section to say this was false. One user, 10X Tech Bro (@EdunEweniyu) requested the link to the report while another user, Property Captain (@PropertyCaptain) commented that this was from his imagination. The question now is if this claim is a product of an NBS report or a creation of  the Twitter user’s imagination? This prompted DUBAWA to do this check. Verification  To verify this, we first visited the NBS website to study its 2022 reports released so far  since the claimant did not specify which 2022 document of the bureau it was making reference to. Recent reports found on the website were the Consumers price Index (CPI) and inflation report for January, February and March 2022, Automative Gas oil (fuel) price watch January 2022, among others. A look at its data release calendar from January to May shows no Labour force statistics have been released in 2022. The Labour force statistics by the bureau usually contain information on unemployment and underemployment. A keyword search on this statistics shows the most recent report available is the labour statistics for the second quarter (Q2) of 2020. The labour force survey conducted prior to this was for the 3rd quarter of 2018. The report for Q2 of 2020, puts underemployment at 28.6%, while that of Q3 in 2018 puts underemployment rate at 20.1%.  We observed that in these labour force reports, the bureau does not state the amount Nigerian workers classified as employed or underemployed earn apart from the rate of employment or underemployment in percentages. Even if there was a 2022 labour force statistics report which does not exist, it will not show how much workers (employed or underemployed) earn, be it ₦60,000, less or more. Having studied the website of the bureau, we called its statistical information officer, Moses Matthew, who said no data on labour has been released this year.  “No. Ask the person where he got his information from,” he added.  We reached out to the claimant on Twitter, requesting his data source to be sure which document by NBS he was referring to, and he said he got the information from a Twitter space.  “Got the information on a Twitter live space session and sent a series of emails to NBS to confirm this,” he said.  When asked if any of his emails got a response, he said no.  Conclusion Our findings show there is no 2022 report by the NBS on the labour force, and previous reports do not carry the amount earned by employed or underemployed workers in Nigeria. This makes the claim false. ",FALSE,30/05/2022,https://dubawa.org/how-true-is-claim-92-of-nigerians-earn-less-than-%e2%82%a660000/
Claim: News report claims the president sacked the Central Bank governor.,"Since information that Godwin Emefiele intends to run for president came into the public space, there have been calls for him to resign. Recently, President Muhammadu Buhari asked all appointed officers seeking political offices to resign.  Although the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) governor first denied his intention to run, he went ahead to ask a court to declare him eligible for the presidential ticket of any political party while serving as the governor. This was, however. recently withdrawn. Following this, a screenshot went viral on WhatsApp with the claim that the president had sacked the CBN governor.  This was shared on a WhatsApp user’s WhatsApp status with the caption “if this is true, then buhari did a very good job”.  The said screenshot has the headline “BREAKING NEWS; Buhari sacks CBN governor, Godwin Emefiele”. The screenshot has the byline “Opinion Nigeria” and it was shared on Wednesday May 25,2022.  We first carried out a keyword search on the byline in the screenshot to find if the said report actually exists or the image was created.  We found the website opinionnigeria.com and the news story on the governor’s sack was shared 12 hours ago. The story which linked this sack to the president’s order that appointed officers should resign noted that the president cannot unilaterally sack the governor. We however noticed that the story did not quote anybody or platform as its source. This is suspicious because an ideal news story always has and quotes a source..  Having found that this screenshot was from an actual report, we needed to establish if the president actually sacked Mr Emefiele, so we conducted a keyword search on google. This led to fact-checks by Daily Trust, and BBC, and news reports by Punch, ripples Nigeria etc . debunking this.  We also found out that the Central Bank chief of Algeria, Rostom Fadli, was recently removed. This may have fueled the rumour in Nigeria.  A keyword search on Twitter led to a news report by The Nation, which debunked this claim quoting the CBN’s spokesman Osita Nwanisobi.  A look at the CBN’s website showed there was so far no release on the rumoured sack. The latest release on the website is on Tuesday, May 24, 2022 on a fire incident at its Makurdi branch.  Seeing that the bank’s spokesperson was quoted by the news reports debunking the claim, DUBAWA went ahead to send an enquiry email to the bank because it was too late to put a phone call across. Also, a look at the Twitter handle of the president’s spokesperson, Garba Shehu, showed nothing of that nature. No press release or announcement about the governor’s rumoured sack. The state house website which publishes news on the presidency’s recent activities also did not have any news of the rumoured sack. Our findings and news reports show that the claim that president Muhammadu Buhari sacked the CBN governor is false.

"CLAIM: Popular blog SierraLoaded’s re-published story from Exclusive Newspaper claims the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) has a gamut of sanctions for fake degree awarding institutions and fake degree holders, including a fine of Le 50 million or five years jail term with property confiscation . This claim the blog attributes to the Communications Officer of ACC.","Sierra Leone has been hit by a fake degree scandal. Public discourse and social media conversations over the last few months have been pregnant with details of the scandal. A  whistleblower continues  to publish names of people alleged to be holders of fake degrees while there have also been rebuttals and denials.  In the midst of these publications,  a viral post by one of the leading online news platforms in Sierra Leone named SierraLoaded, which outlined a number of sanctions to fake degree awarding institutions, appears to be grabbing the headlines but for the wrong reasons. Details of the sanctions put out by Sierraloaded are captured in the following screenshots; The news platform further stated that “According to the ACC mouthpiece, this penalty is in line with the new ACC Act, adding that the anti-graft institution has now decided to launch an investigation on the alarming issue because the Commission thinks it is corruption related.” As can be seen from the above, the sanctions to fake awarding institutions were spelled out but were attributed to  the communication officer of the Anti-Corruption Commission, Sylvanus Blake.  Given the level of interest and controversy this scandal has generated, DUBAWA decided to educate its readers and Sierra Leoneans at large on how to identify a fake degree awarding institution. Even more importantly, DUBAWA has decided to verify the gamut of sanctions and the claim made by Exclusive Newspaper as re-published by  Sierraloaded which had already garnered over 5,000 views and keeps getting more traction. It was shared by a follower of Dubawa with a request for us to fact-check the claim.  DUBAWA immediately reached out to the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC)  Assistant Public Relations Officer, Sylvanus Blake, who was quoted by SierraLoaded. Mr. Blake admitted to seeing the claim by SierraLoaded but flatly denied portions of the content. According to him, neither he, nor any member of the ACC has made any comment about confiscation of properties and was surprised that this piece of information will find expression in any report.  He says all attempts to reach out to SierraLoaded for a rejoinder have been futile. In a written response to DUBAWA,  Mr Sylvanus Blake stated as follows;  “We appreciate the contributions of the media including the Sierra Loaded itself to the fight against corruption and we continue to seek your continued support in this regard. On the stated matter, the ACC’s PRO had not granted any interview to Sierra Loaded. The account stated is not representative of the ACC nor the PR officer mentioned. *Though the penalty stated is correct for any corruption offence for which one is found guilty in a competent court, including the 128(3&4) itself, the PR never mentioned confiscation of properties owned by proprietors of fake institutions* All interviews granted by the PR team on the fake degrees saga had spoken on the following: It is worth noting that this process has already begun. Thanks again for reaching out. I’m grateful.”  Mr Blake further declared that the “ACC has not launched a criminal investigation and does not think or view the issues of fake degrees as corruption until there has been an audit of qualifications to ascertain whether workers have used the fake certificates to gain employment or even earned some other undue advantages.  The ACC’s task force is only in the process of helping the public sector verify the credentials and qualifications of their workers and it is only through this audit process that the ACC can unearth any wrongdoing as per the ACC act,“Mr Blake concluded. In investigating the claims and sanctions as put out by SierraLoaded,  DUBAWA also found a press release calling on public sector institutions to immediately conduct academic credentials verification/audit.  DUBAWA can confirm that a  committee has since been set up by the house of parliament to investigate the issue of fake degrees, and other institutions like the Ministry of Technical and Higher Education have instructed  all academic staff who acquired their credentials from unaccredited institutions and used such certifications for employment purposes to resign in the next two weeks. Pending the outcome of a thorough investigation, the National Telecommunications Commission has also suspended its Director General and a few others suspected to be holders of fake degrees. A few other institutions have already taken action following the press release. With Mr Blake denying ever granting an interview to SierraLoaded and also denying portions of the sanctions regime, DUBAWA decided to seek clarity from Sierraloaded on the report it put out, particularly on the issue of confiscation of properties and whether or not the organisation has any evidence to back the claims on property confiscation. The desk editor at SierraLoaded later revealed that the story shared on their platform was a re-published version of the original story that was published by the Exclusive Newspaper on the 4th May 2022 and that all content belongs entirely to the Exclusive Newspaper.  SierraLoaded could therefore not substantiate the claim that there will be property confiscation as part of the sanctions regime. May 4 2022 front page showing a featured story on penalties of fake degree on top-right. From the findings of our investigation, DUBAWA affirms that the penalty of 50 million leones or five years jail term or both for people found guilty of issuing  fake certificates  is correct but the ACC does not intend to confiscate any related institution’s properties until the court instructs.

Claim: A post on Facebook claims that tea made from corn silk can cure certain illnesses.,"In a Facebook post titled “Health Benefits Of Corn Silk,” Healthforbes, a health oriented page on Facebook, claims that corn silk can cure illnesses. Some of the listed illnesses the plant can allegedly cure includes Bladder Infection, Kidney Stone, Diabetes, High Blood Pressure, Bed-wetting, and High Cholesterol Levels are “some of the illnesses cured by corn silk,” the post pointed out. The post encouraged the use of corn silk as an effective remedy for the listed illnesses and outlined how members of the public can prepare the corn silk tea with hot water for intake. Healthforbes, the  Facebook page that shared the post has over 7k followers.  The page predominantly covers nutrition and diseases related information. It also has a website where food and other health related contents are published. “We Improve the healthcare system globally for everyone to build a stronger and healthier healthcare routine,” it’s “About Us,”a message reads in part. “We ensure that our content and services and products uphold the highest standards of health, pharmaceuticals, finance and telecommunication Integrity,” another message says. Misleading myths around the remedy of diseases is a serious concern in Africa. In 2014 during the outbreak of the Ebola disease, several persons were reported dead and several others hospitalised after consuming excessive quantities of salt and bitter kola to prevent Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) attack, following a viral message on social media that the mythical remedy could prevent the spread of the Ebola virus. Corn Silks are those long hairy thread-like fibers that are discarded when preparing corn for cooking. In an article, Healthline described it as “the long, thread-like strands of plant material that grow underneath the husk of a fresh ear of corn.” There is a lot of information about the topic on the internet. Ranging from articles to individual opinions, many of them linked the herbal usage of corn silk two centuries ago in traditional Chinese and Native American medicine.  There are also minute studies that have proven the fiber to possess bioactive components capable of “repairing damage to the kidney, bursting kidney stones, preventing prostate cancer, and treating urinary incontinence.” A recent study titled “Study of kidney repair mechanisms of corn silk leaves; combination in rat model of kidney failure.” The study, published in the International Journal of Pharmacology confirmed an improved renal function in “gentamicin-piroxicam induced kidney failure.” But, the study concluded that corn silk, in combination with “binahong,” a native plant from Indonesia that is used for tissue healing,  possesses renal function improving activity which is slightly better compared to the activity of each extract alone.  Also, the result of another study suggested that corn silk could be used to burst kidney stones. A kidney stone is a hard object that is made from chemicals in the urine. It is painful when passed out. “Corn silk encourages urination, while the potassium in the herb offset potassium loss caused by increased urination. It contains flavonoids (may sin), Allantois, Alkaloids, Sapiens, Volatile oil, Mucilage, Vitamins B, C and K, Silicon,” the study noted. A 2021 article by EmedicineHealth also explained that corn silk is used as a medicine for the listed ailments. On diabetes and high blood pressure, it raised a concern that large amounts of corn silk might lower blood sugar. And this “could interfere with blood sugar control in people who have diabetes,” especially when used alongside other diabetes medications.  Other articles also explain how to cure child bed-wetting using corn silk tea. But it is not able to determine the extent of its accuracy. It concluded that “more evidence is needed to rate the effectiveness of corn silk for these uses”. Adding to that, Dubawa also observed that all the articles checked carry a disclaimer that refer users to consult their medical doctor before using corn silk for any treatment. An Associate Professor from the Department of Botany, University of Lagos, Dr. Aleem Babalola Kadiri, told DUBAWA that while corn silk is used for treating many diseases, including optical conditions like glaucoma, “all the claims still require scientific proof.” Another Senior Lecturer in the Botany Department of the University of Lagos, Dr. Temitope Onuminya, told DUBAWA that most studies about the efficacy of corn silk have been conducted on mice and not on humans. She also noted that corn silk, “when taken in high doses, can cause liver toxicity” and “interfere with the medications that patients are using in treating diabetes, as well as high and low blood pressure.” However, Dr. Onuminya notes that daily doses as high as 4.5 grams per pound of body weight (10 grams per kg) are likely safe for most people and that Corn silk is available as a supplement in some countries. She recommends taking a maximum dosage of “400-450 milligrams 2-3 times per day.” She, however, warned that a dose of more than 2,000 mg/kg can be lethal. Although corn silk is routinely used in herbal medicine, studies on it are limited. For safe use, there is a need for researchers and health authorities to have a clear consensus as to whether consuming corn silk as a remedy to diseases is safe for humans. Hence, there is insufficient evidence to ascertain the claim. ",claim,18/05/2022,https://dubawa.org/no-evidence-corn-silk-works-as-cure-for-diseases/
"Claim: A viral WhatsApp message has a claim that the Vice President of Nigeria, Yemi Osinbajo, is offering grants to Nigerians.","The 2023 presidential election is getting closer for Nigerians to make crucial decisions on who gets to pilot the affairs of this country for the next four years. The stomach infrastructure syndrome is a thing in Nigeria as politicians seek to attract voters before and during an election period.  In 2017, Punch published a report with images depicting how far Nigerian politicians go to win the hearts or votes of Nigerians.  As a result of the affluence of politicians over the years, DUBAWA has fact-checked claims like this, as scammers continue to hide under the images of prominent politicians. For example, we exposed that scammers pose as Tibubu to defraud online users. Recently, a message is making the rounds on WhatsApp, with the claim that presidential aspirant, Yemi Osinbajo, is giving out a grant of ₦33,000 to Nigerians.  According to the message with this link attached, the ₦33,000 support grant available to Nigerians is from the Vice-president Campaign Support. Due to the virality of this claim and the possible effect it could have on the electorates’ decisions, DUBAWA chose to verify it.  DUBAWA carried out a keyword search on the grant to ascertain the existence of grants from the presidential aspirant. We found no grant offer from Mr. Osinbajo. An analysis of the link on Domainbigdata, a web service used to verify domain’s ownership, reveals multiple users have reported the website for abuses. There is a common red flag on links like this, and this is the existence of deceitful testimonials on the page. Internet con artists have been found to use this method to draw potential victims into their caves. Also, the links to the supposed comments are not clickable nor followable as it particularly appears on the page.  Another obvious red flag we spotted is the contents on the page replete with grammatical errors, poor punctuations and user experience. For instance, the page has it that “on Monday 25th of April 2022. Offer a matching grant of ₦33,0000 to individuals to support youth and all Nigerians to solicit for your support upon declaration of my interest to run for the office of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria”. Apparently, the message went viral on WhatsApp due to the conditions and instructions on the website. As shown in the screenshot above, the page asks visitors to share the information further to reach more people. This implies that those who are drawn by the information will share it further, hence its virality. Con artists frequently use this strategy to entice people to visit their websites. We also found a supposed sponsor card on the page attached with a bar tagged ‘contact’. The supposed contact at the bottom of the page is not clickable, seemingly taking us nowhere. Our findings show that the presidential aspirant, Yemi Osinbajo, is not offering ₦33,000 to Nigerian youth under the National Youth Empowerment Funds.

Claim: A social media user claims her baby was born with a full dentition.,"There have been several myths around babies teeth, when they sprout, how they sprout and sometimes even why etc. A typical example is  an Instagram post by “Yourblackizmagic” who shared a screenshot of a post by Kaitlyn Valdes with the claim her baby was born with adult sets of teeth. Yourblackizmagic shared the post asking questions around the possibility of the situation, “Is this real?” the caption inquired. The screenshot of the alleged post, referenced to Kaitlyn Valdes, showed pictures of a baby smiling with a mouth beaming with adult teeths.  Verification DUBAWA first traced and found the original post made by Kaitlyn Valdez on Instagram and Facebook on Saturday, May 1, 2022.  The post was shared with the caption “Remember this? This is her now. Feel old yet?”. In the comment section of the post, however, it was observed that no one addressed the image, or made comments about it. Most users who reacted to the post seem to be making enquiries about seemingly business-related matters.  Teething is a normal part of a baby’s development. It occurs between four to seven months of age but our research shows some babies are born with teeth. Some babies are born with one or two teeth called natal teeth (teeth present at birth).  Natal teeth are not common and are often small, not fully developed, weak and discoloured. This review notes that Natal teeth occur in one out of 2,000 or 3,000 babies. The exact cause of natal teeth in newborns is unknown but factors like genetics, fever, infection or malnutrition, have been suggested. Researchers have also suggested some medical conditions that may be associated with it. They are; cleft lip and palate, Sotos syndrome, Ellis-van Creveld syndrome (chondroectodermal dysplasia), Hallermann-Streiff syndrome (oculomandibulofacial syndrome with hypotrichosis), and Jadassohn-Lewandowsky syndrome (congenital pachyonychia). While there have been an identified case of natal teeth here, there are so far no studies to confirm the cause of it. It is worthy of note that natal teeth are different from neonatal teeth which erupt in the child’s mouth during the first month of life. A quick look at other images of the child who is now a toddler reveals the teeth shown in the image of the baby do not look like the set of teeth observed in the toddler. So was the image of the baby manipulated? Were the alleged natal teeth removed before the child grew another set of teeth?  To answer this, a Google search was done to find when it first appeared online and this led to several reports. AbcNews, and Healthline, shared this image but noted these are not the kind of teeth babies are born with. On the other hand, a report by Legit.com in May 2021, shared the same images in this claim with the narrative that a baby born with full dentition breaks the internet. This article, however, did not give detail on where the child was born, the name of the child or the parents of the child. Another website thepreachersportal tried to give  a spiritual explanation for this without details of the baby or its source.  Further analysis on Forensically did not show any evidence of manipulation around the teeth. However, DUBAWA uncovered an application called FaceApp that has been used in the past by a photographer to alter a baby’s dentition with that of an adult. This photographer, identified as Amy Haehl, used a feature in FaceApp to show what newborns will look like with teeth. The result of the Haehl experiment looks similar to the image shared by Valdez.  FaceApp is a mobile application (App) for photo and video Artificial Intelligence (AI) editing. It was launched on iOS in January 2017 and on Android in February 2017. There are several manipulation options like editor, options to add an impression, make-up, smiles, hair colours, hairstyles, glasses, age or beards. Evidence of manipulation was not evident using the forensically tool because the image was not edited using photoshop but with FaceApp. Here the edited parts are not technically added so it is difficult to see what was manipulated.  Apparently, the teeth in the image of the baby have no characteristics of natal teeth, as they look more like adult teeth.  On the other hand, the image of the toddler Kaitlyn Valdez later shared showed what looked like an ideal primary tooth (usually 20 teeth when complete). The toddler’s set of teeth is not a complete dentition as portrayed in the first image. The image of this child shows she has two upper and four lower teeth making a total of six which is nowhere near the number of teeth in the image of the baby.  When DUBAWA contacted health experts over the possibility of teeth in newborns and what it should look like, a Gynaecologist at the National hospital, Jeremiah Agim, noted he had seen a case of natal teeth, but they look nothing like this. “Natal teeth are teeth babies are born with while neonatal teeth develop within the first 28 days of life. The natal teeth are usually few, weak and small. Some can be fully formed. I can not say if the pictures were manipulated or not, I am not a dentist. I only saw one case as a student during my paediatric posting” he explained. Suggesting we speak to a dentist, he said “the treatment is to remove the teeth which is the work of a dentist. That is for the ones that are immature and not fully formed. So a dentist would have seen various presentations of this condition”. A dental therapist, Agu Chioma, at the Army command and Nigerian Army Officers’ Wives Association (NAOWA) hospital, Abuja said the teeth portrayed in the image is not possible because babies born with teeth are not born with full dentition.  “This is not possible, maybe photoshop. A baby can be born with teeth not a full dentition” she said.  Our Findings, confirmed by experts, revealed that although it is true some babies are born with teeth, they are not full dentition. The image of the baby with full dentition is false because it was manipulated. ",MOSTLY-FALSE,18/05/2022,https://dubawa.org/can-babies-be-born-with-full-teeth/
Claim: A Twitter user claims the annual salary of the Nigerian president is ₦30 million.,"On Wednesday April 20, 2022, the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) held its National Executive Council (NEC) meeting where the price for nomination forms for various elective positions was announced. For the Presidency, the nomination form cost ₦70 million while the expression of interest form cost N30 million, totalling ₦100 million.  This high cost has continued to raise concerns and condemnations from Nigerians online and offline. One of the critics on the popular microblogging social media platform, Twitter, Ayobami(@dondekojo) in his tweet claimed the nomination form of the party is more than the president’s three years salary, insinuating the president earns ₦30 million in a year. Screenshot of the Twitter post.  This tweet which was shared on the same day the prices were announced had generated 3,215 likes and a total 1,822 retweets 24 hours later.  “The salary of the President is ₦30,000,000 annually. APC nomination form alone is more than 3 years salary for a 4-year tenure” the tweet read.  Under this tweet, Twitter users condemned the ruling party for the outrageous amount for its nomination form but a user, Style (@Olaitan_Ebby) in a bid to correct Ayobami said the figures given as the president’s salary is false.   “You goofed. The President’s salary is 14 million naira monthly and his vice is 12 miilion naira. So the President makes 168million million per annum thanks” the tweet read.  Another user FredMighty (@Donalldfrederic) in a bid to substantiate Ayobami’s claim tweeted: “Now who really goofed?”. He supported his claim with a screenshot from a popular website, Wikipedia. The conflicting figures and the need to put the right information out there prompted us to verify this.  According to the Revenue Mobilisation Allocation and Fiscal Commission (RMAFC), the agency guiding the remuneration of public office holders is the  “certain political, public and judicial office holders (salaries and allowances, etc.) (Amendments) Act, 2008”.  According to information and documents obtained from the website of the RMAFC, the annual basic salary of the Nigerian President is ₦3,514,705. Addition of hardship and consistency allowance cost ₦1,757,350.50 and ₦8,786,762.50 respectively shot up the annual take home of the president to ₦14,058,820. Leave allowance is paid once annually and it costs ₦351,470.50; this makes the maximum annual earning of the President to be ₦14,410,288.5 according to RMAFC. Other allowances include motor vehicle fueling and maintenance, special assistant, personal assistant, domestic staff, entertainment, utilities, security, newspapers etc to be enjoyed by the President are listed as TBP (to be provided). DUBAWA reached out to the claimant to confirm if he was referring to the salary or salary with allowances but he failed to reply to messages. Seeing the monthly take home of the president excluding allowances is N292,892.08, then his basic annual earning would be ₦3,514,705 which is far below the ₦30 million given by the claimant.  Inclusion of annual hardship, consistency and leave allowances which cost ₦1,757,350.50, ₦8,786,762.50 and ₦351,470.50 respectively will increase the annual earning of the President to ₦14,410,288.5 which is also far below @dondekojo’s ₦30 million claim. Also, President Buhari serves as the Minister of Petroleum and according to the RMAFC, the monthly salary of a minister, including allowances, is ₦650,136.65. The annual basic salary of a Nigerian Minister is N2,026,400 while the allowances (excluding estacodes and duty tour allowance which is paid per night and furniture which is paid once in four years) cost the sum of ₦9,216,680. The allowances bring the total annual earning of the Minister of Petroleum to ₦11,243,080. When this is added to the earning of Mr Buhari’s ₦14,410,288.5 presidential earnings, it amounts to ₦25,653,368.5 which is below the ₦30 million claim made on Twitter. The claim that the Nigerian President earns ₦30 million annually is false. Information from the RMAFC, the agency responsible for determining the remuneration appropriate for political, public and judicial office holders, shows the president’s monthly earning is ₦1,171,568.20, totalling about ₦14,410,288.5 annually while that of a federal minister amounts to ₦11,243,080 annually. That means President Buhari couldn’t have earned more than ₦25,653,368.5 as salaries annually.

Claim: A viral screenshot claims President Buhari said he is not aware of the ongoing ASUU strike,"The Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) on February 14, 2022, embarked on a four-week warning strike which was extended by two months to afford the government more time to address all of its demands. The major demands of ASUU are; the renegotiation of its ASUU-FG 2009 agreement and the deployment of University Transparency and Accountability Solution (UTAS) for payment of its members’ salaries. On Thursday May 5, 2022, a screenshot went viral with the claim that president Muhammadu Buhari said he is not aware of the strike action. The news story was said to be published the same day by World Of News. The alleged report read “I don’t know ASUU is on strike since when and how long, nobody ever told me ASUU is on strike,” Buhari says.  First of all, there is no news platform with the name “World Of News.” Looking at the screenshot, we observed that the byline had no name, just a combination of letters and numbers (kqce4), which is unlike an ideal news story. A keyword search did not lead to any news report on this claim or anything related.  We, however, found reports by the Guardian, Premium Times, noting the minister of labour,  Chris Ngige, updated the president on the deliberations and progress regarding the strike action.  This clearly shows the president is aware even though he has remained silent on the issue even at the recent Worker’s Day celebration where he was represented by the Vice President, Yemi Osibanjo.  Also, analysis of the image on Forensically shows the image had been manipulated.  Error level analysis shows the byline, date and text of the story show they were typed over another. Secondly, the image carries the three colour frames that indicate manipulation.  Clone detection also reveals different manipulation done on the image. President Muhammadu Buhari did not say he is unaware of ASUU’s strike action because our findings and analysis show the screenshot was manipulated and no news report carried the claim. It is also remarkable that news reports in the past have shown the president is aware of the strike action, given that he is usually updated.

Claim: Nigeria is the first country in Africa to launch the One Health Strategic Plan.,"Climate change has become a major discussion in the world with different stakeholders brainstorming on how best to mitigate its effect. One of these efforts birthed what is now known as One Health. This is an approach by countries to design and implement programmes, policies, legislation and research for multiple sectors to communicate and work together towards achieving better public health outcomes. While the term “One Health” is fairly new, the concept has been in existence for a long time and has been recognised globally. It can be traced to when the link between human and animal health was established between 1821 to 1902. One Health became a recommended approach and  political reality in 2008 when representatives from more than 120 countries and 26 international and regional organisations attended the 2008 International Ministerial Conference on Avian and Pandemic Influenza in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. The first One Health Summit was held in Davos, Switzerland in 2012 and has subsequently gained recognition globally as an effective way to fight health issues at the human-animal-environment interface, including zoonotic diseases.  African ministers of health and environment demonstrated an early commitment to One Health when they signed the Libreville Declaration at the first Inter-Ministerial Conference on Health and Environment in 2008 and subsequently endorsed a 10-year Strategic Action Plan to scale up health and environment interventions in Africa from 2019 to 2029 at the third Inter-Ministerial Conference in 2018. On Wednesday, April 20, 2022, during the the Centre for Journalism Innovation and Development (CJID Master Class on health, environment and climate change reporting, the centre’s health program officer, Adebowale Adedigba, said Nigeria’s health minister of state health, Adeleke Mamora, claims Nigeria is the first country in Africa to launch the one health strategic plan.  Did the minister actually make this claim? If yes, how true is this claim? This prompted us to verify this claim.  To establish if the minister made this claim at any point, we conducted a keyword search and found a report by reliefweb which noted the minister said this at the launch of the plan in 2019. “Nigeria has developed a One Health strategic plan to meet its human, animal and environmental health challenges. This approach drives innovations that are important to manage the outbreaks we experience and offers synergy across our various ministries. We hope that the implementation of this plan in Nigeria can serve as a model for other African countries,” the report quoted the minister. Another report by Business Day also quoted the minister as saying the same thing.  Having established the minister said this, we needed to know if this narrative is true so we searched for other African countries’ One Health plan and when they were created or launched.  This article looks at the successes and future challenges of One Health in the African context using three countries; Nigeria, Tanzania and Uganda so we searched for the three countries. Nigeria’s one health strategic plan which is an 80 page document, is a five year plan from 2019 to 2023. We found out that Tanzania has a 66 page One Health plan from 2015-2020. We also found Uganda has a one health plan for 2018-2022. The 52 page document is a product of a collaboration between Uganda’s Ministry of Health (MoH), Ministry of Agriculture Animal Industry and Fisheries (MAAIF), Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA) and Ministry of Water and Environment (MWE) with financial and technical support from United States Agency for International Development (USAID)/EPT-2 Preparedness and Response (P&R) Project. Looking at these documents by the three countries, we can see Tanzania had its One Health document in 2015, followed by Uganda in 2018 before Nigeria’s 2019-2023 plan.  Our findings show Nigeria is not the first country in Africa to launch the One Health plan because we found one health plan documents by Tanzania in 2015 and Uganda in 2018.

Claim: A Facebook user claims that a poisonous spider can kill a human being within five minutes of stinging an individual.,"Nigeria and Africa have been home to venomous insects and animals alike. According to a Premium Times report in 2017, over 250 Nigerians died of snakebites in just three weeks. In 2021, Premium Times reported that Nigeria recorded 2,000 deaths from snakebites every year, a statement made by the Minister of State for Health, Olorunnimbe Mamora. Malaria has also been an issue in Africa and 600,000 deaths were recorded in 2021 by the World Health Organization, according to The Cable. As a result of these lingering dangers, Nigerians pay a considerable level of attention to their environment.  Spiders are now the concern for this Facebook user, Lawrence Ukwu, who shared a post warning beachgoers to avoid a poisonous spider capable of killing an individual within five minutes.  The post includes three pictures of the spider, accompanied with the warning statement. “For those of you who are going to the beach. Please beware of this. Don’t try to pick it up thinking it’s a work of art.  It’s a very poisonous spider.  If it stings you will die within 5 minutes,” the user stated.  One commenter, Komolafe Sunday thanked the poster for sharing the information while Capitan Johnerro, who seemed to doubt the information, asked, “How true is this?” Such claims have the potential to scare people off the acclaimed environments these spiders are said to be found. A viable reason DUBAWA opts to fact-check this claim. DUBAWA carried out a Google Reverse Image Search on the image of the alleged picture of the spider. Results uncovered on Insect Identification reveals the spider is called the cork-lid trapdoor spider. Insect Identification notes that the spider can be found in the United States of America, Mexico and Canada. This implies its rarity in Nigeria, a contrast to the claimant’s earlier warning to Nigerian beachgoers.  Additionally, a tweet made by the original photographer, Nicky Bay, (@singaporemacro) in 2020, admitting the virality of his piece of work.  “This is a Cyclocosmia, a genus of cork-lid trapdoor spiders with a posteriorly truncated abdomen,” he tweeted. The photographer did not mention whether or not the  venom of the spider is poisonous to humans as alleged by the claimant. He also never mentions that it can kill anyone within five minutes. In Fact, he debunked the claim, stating clearly that the spider is NOT dangerous to humans. “It is actually a very docile spider with medically insignificant venom,” he clarified. DUBAWA also found that Check Your Fact interviewed an arachnologist,  Sebastian Echeverri to ascertain the claim of the photographer.  The arachnologist confirmed that “its venom barely does anything to humans because no spiders can or need to eat humans.” We also carried out a keyword search to find if the spider has caused any death and found none on the internet. Research has shown that the spider is harmless to humans. The photographer, expert and keyword search all showed that the spider cannot kill humans.

Claim: A viral screenshot claims Elon Musk in a tweet said he would buy Coca-Cola next and include cocaine as an ingredient.,"Entrepreneur and investor, Elon Musk, who is popularly known for his various businesses like SpaceX, Tesla etc., recently closed the deal to acquire the bird application, Twitter for $44 billion. Following this acquisition announcement, he has been making several comments on what he intends to do with the deal. Recently, what appears to be the screenshot of his tweet was shared with us for verification in view of its virality. This screenshot claims he said he would buy Coca-Cola next and add cocaine to its ingredients.  “Next i’m buying Coca-Cola to put cocaine back in,” the tweet read. Coca-Cola, which was invented in 1885 by John Pemberton, a pharmacist from Atlanta, Georgia, used to contain cocaine in the form of an extract of the coca leaf. This inspired the “Coca” part of the beverage’s name while the “Cola” comes from the kola nut (which contains caffeine, another stimulant). This was subsequently eliminated because the desired flavour could be extracted from the coca leaves, removing the cocaine and leaving the drug aside as a byproduct. A quick look at Elon Musk’s Twitter account which was created in 2009 and has over 87 million followers, showed he actually tweeted the statement in the screenshot. In fact, the tweet was shared in the early hours of Thursday, April 28, 2022 and had already generated over 2.7 million likes, 119 quote tweets and 439 retweets.  Additionally, a keyword search on Google also referenced the tweet to Elon’s Twitter handle confirming the originality of the tweet. Notably, Elon’s tweet was also headlined by Fox Business, Bloomberg, Business Today, etc. as a viable news story etc. Additionally, DUBAWA also analysed the screenshot of the tweet on Forensically, comparing it to a fake tweet that was forged by DUBAWA using Tweetgen. The results confirmed  Elon’s tweet to be genuine. A typical fake tweet created using a tool is usually framed by a three colored pattern. As magnified in the image above, the fake tweet forged by DUBAWA bears such a frame. In original tweets actually tweeted on Twitter, the screenshots do not carry such frames as seen in the results of Elon’s tweet below.  Conclusion Our findings show that the claim in the viral screenshot is real as we found the original tweet on Elon Musk’ Twitter page. Our analysis also shows the viral screenshot of the tweet was not manipulated.   ",genuine,05/05/2022,https://dubawa.org/yes-elon-musk-made-comment-about-purchasing-coca-cola-and-adding-cocaine/
"Claim: Viral links on WhatsApp claim that Peak Milk is giving customers a chance to win ₦100,000 after filling out a questionnaire in commemoration of its 68th anniversary.","Peak milk is a brand in the Nigerian dairy industry, produced by Friesland Campina WAMCO Nigeria Plc,  under the auspices of the Royal Friesland Campina N.V. First attempt to establish the company in Nigeria began in 1954 but local production started in 1975. Since then, it has embarked on various projects to boost patronage and give back to society. In commemoration of the Christmas season in 2021, the company unveiled the Merry Peakmas campaign tagged #ShareLoveShareNourishment where winners were rewarded with Peak Milk (Nourishment) in a box and N20,000 worth of shopping vouchers. In line with this offer, different links are now circulating on WhatsApp, all claiming to give out ₦100,000 in commemoration of the Peak brand’s 68 years of operations in Nigeria. Some of the links are provided here, here, and here. When each of these links is clicked, the user is forcefully redirected to a form that requests answers to four questions:  User’s familiarity with Peak Milk, age, rating of service delivery and gender. Subsequently, the user is congratulated for successfully providing answers and informed to pick three boxes from an array of 12 boxes that containing different prizes. The first choice is replied as negative, while the second choice contains the ₦100,000 prize.  To claim the prize, the user is informed to ‘tell 5 groups or 20 friends about the promotion.’ After that is executed, the user address is requested to complete the registration and to deliver the ‘supposed’ gift ‘within 5-7 days.’ The first noticeable red flag with the website is the limited use of the brand name in the hyperlinks. A genuine link offering such information uses the brand name in the website domain name; which is the case with the original website of Peak Milk https://peakmilk.com.ng/. Additionally, DUBAWA uncovered that the connection protocol HTTP is not encrypted. This simply implies that any information provided on such a website can be intercepted by third parties who may intend to gather data shared between the two systems. As a result, the user’s information can be easily hacked in comparison to an encrypted site (HTTPS). When the authenticity of the website was further analyzed on Scamvoid.net (a website that provides information about a website’s reliability), findings revealed a poor trust for the page and outlines that the domain name is very recent (about 12 days ago) and traffic is low. These are also similar traits of malicious websites previously fact-checked by DUBAWA. Typical of such websites, it was discovered that neither the comments, page logo and listings were clickable. Also, all the comments available on the destination website showed that they were made ‘minutes ago’ without any change, irrespective of the time the page is visited. These are forged comments that are used by fraudsters to lure unsuspecting victims.  DUBAWA also discovered that the website was changed to something entirely different after a few days, making it difficult to track the details of the perpetrators. This scenario is found to be similar to previous links fact-checked by DUBAWA, which were discovered to be fraudulent, with a potential to expose users’ details to cybercriminals. Although Peak Milk is yet to reply to an email of inquiry sent to them as of press time, preliminary findings conducted on all the publicity channels of the company show no affiliation to the alleged link in question.  The acclaimed links offering customers of Peak Milk a chance to win ₦100,000 after filling a questionnaire are malicious and were created to mislead unsuspecting members of the public into falling victims of fraudulent schemes. Therefore, this claim is False. ",FALSE,05/05/2022,https://dubawa.org/peak-milk-not-giving-customers-%e2%82%a6100000-to-mark-68-years-anniversary/
"Claim: A user on Facebook claims that Lionel Messi has said that, as a UNICEF ambassador, he would not play against Israel because of the country’s existing tensions with Palestine.","Lionel Andrés Messi, simply referred to as Leo Messi or Lionel Messi, is a soccer player who captains the Argentinian national soccer team and plays for Paris Saint Germain (PSG). The  player is regarded by some as the greatest soccer talent of all time, possibly because  he has been named world player of the year six times (2009–12, 2015, and 2019) by the Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA). In 2010, the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) appointed Messi as a Goodwill Ambassador.   The Israeli–Palestinian conflict has been one of the world’s oldest and ongoing conflicts. Since the occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip by Israel almost 54 years ago, all sorts of conflicts have been unfolding between Israel and Palestine. The most recent one took place  in May 2021 when over 200 deaths were recorded mostly from the Palestinian side.  It is based on this pre-existing context that a user on Facebook, Moa Locks, claims that Lionel Messi has said that as a UNICEF ambassador he would not play against Israel.    “As a UNICEF ambassador, I cannot play against people who kill innocent Palestinian children. We had to cancel the game because we are humans before footballers.” “Love you Messi Respect,” he posted.  The alleged quote was referenced to TyC Sport and shared alongside a picture of the player with the notice: “Cancels his friendly against Israel in support for Israel.” The post was reshared multiple times on Facebook and has attracted diverse reactions, with some users doubting the efficacy of the claim.  When DUBAWA conducted a Google search of the acclaimed statement, the results referenced the statement back to other Facebook posts that neither say where nor when Messi made the statement. Advanced searches further conducted on Lionel Messi’s social media handles and the TYC sport website yielded no results regarding the statement.   Apparently, this alleged statement linked to Lionel Messi has been in circulation  since 2018, soon after the Argentinian football team called off a friendly match with Israel due to threats made against its team members.  In addition, when the claim surfaced on Twitter, Martin Arevalo, an Argentinian sports journalist with TyC Sports (as of 2018), discredited the claim in a quote tweet. He outrightly declared that the claim is false. Adding that Messi never made such a statement on TYC sport or elsewhere.   “What you write is false. Messi did not speak with any means and neither in @TyCSports about this. Report accurately. Messi on this tour I do not speak to the press.” Arevalo tweeted.  A few media outlets have also debunked the claim in 2018, discrediting it as a fabricated falsehood.  Shreds of evidence gathered show the alleged statement was not made by Lionel Messi.

The news article, headlined that “Federal Government Approves ₦75,000 Stipends for Young Nigerians–Apply Now!” and that the offer was only for undergraduate students (N75,000) and NCE students (50,000).  “As Nigeria Teachers celebrate world teacher’s day today, the Federal Government approves N75,000 stipend payment for undergraduate students and N50,000 for NCE students.  Recruitment Trust is an organization that announces job openings for job seekers through its website. The platform has existed since 2019 and has had many visitors using the website to find jobs. While this site may be legit, the offer of stipends by the federal government has not appeared on other job platforms or even on other news websites. This offer is reminiscent of other false job claims, thus interesting DUBAWA to verify the claim. After reading the content of the post, DUBAWA observed that the news article had different information from its headline. Aside from that, it also failed to provide the acclaimed  application link to the said offer. Although the headline stated “apply now,” there was no direction or hyperlink to take users to the offer.  Even though the content referenced the offer to a promise made by the Federal Government of Nigeria through the Minister of Education, Malam Adamu Adamu, that students undergoing degree programmes in education would receive N75,000 stipends every semester, the programme is yet to be activated by the federal government.  The Nation, Nigerian Tribune, and Punch newspapers reported a similar story back in 2021, when Malam Adamu promised to pay stipends for students studying education courses in a speech delivered on his behalf to commemorate the 2021 World Teachers’ Day. However, the federal government never actually disclosed how and when the promise would be implemented, talk less of an “apply now” process as alleged by the blog post.   In addition, DUBAWA conducted another Google keyword search to see if there were other announcements on how to apply for these stipends. Results revealed no further instructions on how to apply, and there was no credible source that even announced the implementation of the programme. Truly, in October 2021, the Federal Government of Nigeria promised N75,000 and N50,000 to students undergoing education programmes. However, it did not provide an application method, and since then the programme is yet to be implemented. The headline is apparently a typical blog post that is forged to attract traffic. As such, this claim is misleading. ",MISLEADING,01/05/2022,https://dubawa.org/misleading-blog-post-claims-nigerian-students-can-apply-for-n75000-stipends-offered-by-fg/
Claim: A viral WhatsApp message claims the Federal Government is offering money to Nigerians under the National Youth Empowerment Fund.,"The Federal Government (FG) of Nigeria has, over the years, introduced a number of initiatives to empower Nigerians, in an effort to curtail poverty and accelerate growth. Examples of federal empowerment initiatives include the N-Power programme for unemployed youths and the school feeding programme which the federal government under President Muhammad Buhari started in 2016.  Recently, a message is making the rounds on WhatsApp, with the claim that a National Youth Empowerment Fund application form for 2022 is out. According to the message, the empowerment fund, which is supposedly the quickest to apply for, is now out for all bonafide Nigerian citizens who need helping hands in their various businesses and education. This fund, according to the viral message, has a vision of giving out N150,000 to N550,000 grants to every citizen under the age of 13-65 years from 2022 to 2024. The message also claims payment for the month of April is currently ongoing. Due to the virality of this claim and the possible  harm it could cause, we chose to verify it.  DUBAWA carried out a keyword search on the youth empowerment fund mentioned in the message but did not find any. Our findings led to the Presidential Youth Empowerment Scheme (P-YES) but there are no calls for applications at the moment. The original P-YES was an initiative started by the current administration in 2020, Nairametrics reported. As noted on the official website, the Office of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation oversees the scheme, which is coordinated by the Senior Special Assistant (SSA) to the president on Youth and Student Affairs. Interestingly, an analysis of the link on Domainbigdata, a web service used to verify domain’s ownership, reveals multiple users have reported the website for abuses. The existence of phony testimonial remarks was another obvious red flag. Internet con artists frequently use this method to draw potential victims into their cave. The links to the supposed comments are not clickable, yet they nevertheless function as a device intended to deceive users. DUBAWA also found that the flags of South Africa, Ivory Coast, Ghana, The Gambia, Nigeria and Uganda are visible on the landing page. This implies that the creator of the page is targeting African countries for his/her mischievous plans. The link to the website is also a ‘Bitly URL’ website. Bitly URL was founded in 2008 as a link shortening and management application. Bitly shortens more than 600 million links for social networking, text messaging, and email every month. It was created with the intention of making it easier for entrepreneurs to post links on social media, attract clients, and sell their products or services.  However, charlatans are increasingly employing Bitly URLs to disseminate fake information and increase traffic to their websites. Apparently, the message went viral on WhatsApp due to the conditions and instructions on the website. As shown in the screenshot above, the alleged website asks visitors to trade further information with other users before accessing the grant. Con artists frequently use this tactic to entice people to visit their websites. Our findings show the Nigerian government is not giving out N150,000 to N550,000 to Nigerian youth under the  National Youth Empowerment Funds.

"In one year time, President Muhammadu Buhari will vacate office after eight years service as the number one citizen of Nigeria, and already, the race for who would take over from him in 2023 has commenced.","In one year time, President Muhammadu Buhari will vacate office after eight years service as the number one citizen of Nigeria, and already, the race for who would take over from him in 2023 has commenced. Under the All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu, former governor of Lagos State, has made his ambition known to Nigerians, as one of many candidates eyeing the president’s seat. In a recent interview with Daily Trust, Mr. Tinubu made a claim that, during his tenure as the Governor of Lagos State, he received zero allocation from the Federation Account Allocation Committee. He  also claimed that Lagos State became the largest economy in Africa, despite the lack of allocation from FAAC. “With zero allocation from FAAC, I turned Lagos State around and today, the state has become the largest economy in Africa,” he claimed. Due to the wide circulation of the claim by the mainstream media and its potential consequence on the decision of electorates’, it is pertinent that DUBAWA fact-check this claim. Claim: Presidential aspirant, Bola Tinubu, in a recent interview with Daily Trust made a claim that Lagos State received zero allocation from the Federation Account Allocation Committee during his tenure as the Governor of the state. Bola Tinubu failed to mention that the federal government started to withhold Lagos State funds in 2004 while his tenure started in 1999. This means he received allocations from FAAC until April, 2004. DUBAWA conducted a keyword search on any withheld allocation of the Lagos State Government by the Federal Government and found a report by All Africa in 2005, about the then President, Olusegun Obasanjo, giving his reasons for withholding Lagos State local government funds.  Notably, when Vice-President, Prof. Yemi Osibanjo recently called on state governors to start making huge investments in areas they have a comparative advantage so as to shore up their Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) and stop complete reliance on federal allocations for survival, he made reference to the Lagos State Government local government council funds that the government of the former president, Olusegun Obasanjo withheld in 2004.  In a Wikileaks’ 2005 document, Lagos State local government funds was also reported to have been withheld by the then president, Olusegun Obasanjo in 2004 and it was soon discontinued after late President Musa Yar’adua came into power in 2007.  As such, out of Mr Tinubu’s 8 years (1999-2007) as governor of Lagos State, the local government allocation funds was only withheld from 2004 until Late President Yar’adua suspended it. Further details in the Wikileaks document shared that the establishment of additional local governments in the state in April, 2004, led the Federal Government to withhold the Local government funds.  Mr Tinubu started his tenure as a Lagos State governor in 1999 and the allocated funds were withheld starting from 2004, already five years into his eight-year two- term tenure. Therefore, Mr Tinubu’s statement is misleading. Bola Tinubu failed to mention that the withheld funds only lasted for a certain period of time in his tenure as the Lagos State Governor. Also, the withheld funds are the local government council allocations. Hence, the claim is misleading. Claim 2: Bola Tinubu, in a recent interview with Daily Trust, made a claim that Lagos State is the largest economy in Africa. Nigeria is the largest economy in Africa. Also, there are no substantial statistics pointing to the direction of Lagos as the largest economy amongst cities in Africa. According to Statista, Nigeria has become the biggest economy on the African continent over the last 30 years. Nigeria’s GDP increased by 3.4 percent last year, after contracting by 1.92 percent in 2020, according to Al Jazeera.  Lagos, on the other hand, has established a reputation as a digital centre that is fast transitioning to a 24-hour economy, accounting for 10% of Nigeria’s total GDP of $432.3 billion. As reported here by Al Jazeera, Nigeria remains the largest economy in Africa. We noted that the presidential aspirant could also be referring to cities’ economies in Africa. In that regard, we conducted research on the largest economy in African cities. There are also no facts to clearly state that Lagos State is the city with the largest economy in Africa. Nigeria remains the largest economy in Africa. Tinubu, in contrast, claims that Lagos State is the largest economy in Africa. Hence, the claim is false.

"Claim: A Twitter user quoted presidential aspirant, Peter Obi, as saying he will rather everyone starve than to borrow for consumption","Peter Obi, a former governor, is  seeking to become Nigeria’s president under the flagship of People’s Democratic Party (PDP). He was the vice presidential candidate of the party in the 2019 general elections.  Recently, a Twitter user, Jack (@Jack_ng01), shared a post with the claim that Peter Obi said he would rather people starve than borrow for consumption.  “Under my watch not a Kobo will be borrowed for consumption, instead we all starve,” he was quoted as saying. The user attached to his post a screenshot of a video on Arise News where this claim was said to have been made by the aspirant.   Other users took to the comment to share their opinion.   A user named Comcombility (@A_zhed) noted that no country exists without borrowing.  “He has also said no country exists without borrowing and in fact, Nigeria can still borrow more. However, what is most important is what borrowed funds are used for,” he tweeted.  Another user Austyno (@AustynoUsh) noted that the quote extracted didn’t do justice to the point the aspirant made.  “You make it look like he would starve people but he was actually coming from somewhere,” @AustynoUsh commented.  Francis Eze (@francisneze) questioning the rationale of borrowing to eat said the aspirant is not against borrowing but borrowing for consumption. “He’s not against borrowing. But he’s against borrowing for consumption. Do you borrow money from people to just eat? How do you pay them back after using it to eat?” Did Peter Obi actually say this or was he taken out of context as suggested by some in the comments section? We searched and found the original video shared on Arise News. This video with the caption “we need someone to get us out of this (APC) – Peter Obi” had 110,000 views as of Tuesday, April, 19, 2022.  Watching the 38 minutes 15 seconds video, we observed that around 13 minutes to 16 minutes into the video, Mr Obi spoke on borrowing for consumption when asked if everything was okay with Nigeria’s debt status.  “Let us be specific about what we are borrowing; he asked me a question, what will you do? I will do it differently. Nigerians will know the reasons for borrowing and it must be borrowed for production. Nobody will spend a kobo or a dollar of borrowed money for consumption, instead we will all starve. That is why I told everybody there is nothing to share again, we must rebuild this country for the future of our children.  Our findings show the claim that presidential aspirant, Peter Obi, said he would rather everyone starve than borrow for consumption is true. The aspirant made this comment to emphasise his opposition against borrowing for consumption, which he believes is not good for the economy.

"Claim: Cancer is not a deadly disease and can be cured using hot lemon water, coconut oil and by reducing sugar intake.","Cancer is a large group of diseases that can start in almost any organ or tissue of the body. It happens when abnormal cells grow uncontrollably, go beyond their usual boundaries to invade adjoining parts of the body or spread to other organs (metastasizing).  Cancer is sometimes referred to as a neoplasm or malignant tumour.  A Facebook post by Aligwo Steve Nwosu claims cancer is not a disease but an apathy. This claim was credited to a cancer specialist at Osh State Medical University in Moscow, Gupta Prasad Reddy.  The post quoted the specialist as saying “cancer is not a deadly disease, but people die only because of apathy (that is a lack of interest). “Cancer is not a disease, but it’s an apathy! Cancer specialist at Osh State Medical University, Moscow, Russia. Gupta Prasad Reddy (BV) says cancer is not a deadly disease, but people die only because of apathy,” part of the post read. The post also claims cancer can be eliminated through three methods. The first method is to stop eating all kinds of sugar because, if you don’t get sugar in your body, cancer cells will end naturally.  The second method is drinking lemon and hot water mixture on an empty stomach before eating at 2am in the morning. The post also claims a study by Maryland College of Medicine shows that this second method is a thousand times better than chemotherapy.  The third method is to take three spoons of organic coconut oil every morning and night.  A keyword search on Cancer specialist at Osh State Medical University, Moscow, Russia and Gupta Prasad led to a fact-check by Africa check which warned against the false cancer cure from “Dr Gupta” on Facebook.  We also found that the said Osh State Medical University, in Moscow, Russia, is Osh State University, a public sector University, in Kyrgyz Republic.  Another search on Maryland College of Medicine led to the University of Maryland school of medicine located at Baltimore in the United States (US). This university was chartered in 1807 as the first public medical school in the US. We looked at the  four claims highlighted from this Facebook post individually.  According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for nearly 10 million deaths in 2020. The most common types are breast, lung, colon and rectal and prostate cancers.  About one-third of deaths from cancer are due to tobacco use, high body mass index, alcohol consumption, low fruit and vegetable intake, and lack of physical activity. This shows that the claim that cancer is not a deadly disease is false.  However, cancer can be prevented by modifying or avoiding key risk factors, implementing existing evidence-based prevention strategies, through early detection of cancer and management of patients who develop cancer. Treatment options include surgery, cancer medicines, chemotherapy or radiotherapy, administered alone or in combination. Low sugar intake has no correlation with cancer.  No study in people has shown cutting down sugar intake prevents or treats cancer, nor has any study shown eating too much sugar causes cancer.  This article by cancer.net explains that the belief that sugar is related to cancer comes from the metabolism process. So when we eat food containing carbohydrates and foods containing sugar, the body breaks it down into glucose which fuels body cells to make the energy needed to survive.  Mayoclinic noted that both normal and cancer cells use glucose for energy. Also, cancer cells metabolise glucose faster than normal cells according to the Warburg Effect. The Warburg Effect is used in diagnosing cancer.  In an imaging test called a Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan, doctors inject radioactive glucose into the bloodstream. Since cancer cells metabolise faster, the PET scan lights up the location of cancer cells and tumours in the body. The image is used to find cancer or evaluate how well cancer treatments are working. The various ways to prevent cancer highlighted by the WHO also does not include reducing sugar intake. This makes the claim false.  An article by the National Centre for Health Research noted that lemons are not a proven remedy against cancer of all types. This report by Deccan Herald also debunked the claim that hot lemon water cures cancer.   Although this study highlights the importance of citrus juices and their extract in a multitargeted-pharmacological strategy, suggesting their role in the prevention of cancer as well as their possible use as co-adjuvants in modern oncological therapies,  there is no study comparing the effectiveness of lemon to chemotherapy.  The above study suggested further experimental and clinical studies to exploit the beneficial aspects of these juices and their extracts in full. Deccan Herald also debunked the claim that hot lemon water is a cure for cancer.  A 2017 study on the Laurie acid, which is found in coconut oil, shows Laurie acid has anti-cancer properties for certain types of cancer,  but additional studies are needed to further corroborate its usefulness in more comprehensive therapeutic approaches. This 2019 study shows Virgin Coconut Oil (VCO), Processed Coconut Oil (PCO) and Fractionated Coconut Oil (FCO) have anti-cancer effects and may be used for the treatment of cancer, especially liver and oral cancer. This claim is false as these promising properties found so far need more research to be standardised as a remedy or cure.  We also found a fact-check by fullfact.org debunking all the cures of cancer in this claim. Our findings and studies show that this Facebook post consists of several claims that are false.

Claim: A Facebook user claims Pope Francis cancelled the Bible and proposed a new book.,"A Facebook post by Nathan Kuma claims Pope Francis, as part of his reform, has cancelled the Bible and proposed creating a new book.  According to Mr Kuma, this is because the pope believes the Bible is outdated and in need of change. “Pope Francis cancels the Bible and proposes to create a new book. According to him the Bible is totally outdated and in need of radical change, and for that reason is officially cancelled. The book that will replace it, as well as the content will be announced by the Church,” part of the post reads.  “We cannot keep trying to talk to our audience in a completely new world with an old book of several thousand years. We are losing disciples and we have to seek to modernise the church, rewrite the Word of God, even if it is the Old Testament, in which there are certain passages which are better not repeated,” according to a quote by the Pope on Facebook.  Mr Kuma said he agrees with the Pope, noting the Bible has too many discrepancies. When this user was challenged in the comment section by another user who stated that the claim was not true, Mr Kuma provided the link to a YouTube video to back up his claim.  We first followed the YouTube link and watched the video. We observed that this four minutes five seconds video posted with the caption “Faith and Reform in the Catholic Church from The Vatican: A wholly Roman Empire”, did not address the topic of the Bible and the need for its change.  The video’s focus was on how Rome remains the heart of catholicism.  A keyword search led to fact-checks by Politifact, snopes, and India today, debunking this claim. We visited the Holy See Press Office Bulletin website which publishes updates of the activities of the Holy See (the government of the Roman Catholic Church) but found no information on the Bible being cancelled or replaced by a new book. We also did not find news reports by credible news platforms on this claim which would have made headlines if the pope actually said so.

Claim: A Facebook page shared a video with the claim that  the people in the video were running away from their communities in Niger State because of Boko Haram and Bandit attacks.,"Over the years, Nigerians have had to contend with security issues. From Boko Haram attacks to unknown bandits, many Nigerians have lost their lives and properties.  Recently, Premium Times reported that 2,968 persons were killed and 1,484 abducted between January and March, 2022. As a result of these occurrences, Nigerians daily express their opinions on social media and share information with their followers regarding lack of security in the country. A perfect instance is a Facebook post by Exodus Biafra TV which shared a 30 seconds video with the claim that  the people in the video were running away from their communities because of Boko Haram and bandits killing people on a daily basis. We also found that another Facebook page, Olamide Sulaimon TV shared the video attributing it to an occurrence in Niger. This post attracted thousands of views on the page and over 100 reactions. With over 4,000 followers on Facebook and the number of shares the post had attracted, we saw the need to verify this claim. Using the video verification tool Invid WeVerify, DUBAWA ran a reverse image search on keyframes from the footage and found that AFP Fact Check had already done a fact-check on the video. AFP found that the language heard in the video does not belong to Nigeria and it is the Moore language spoken predominantly in Burkina Faso. We found that the video has been in existence since 2021 as it is available on a YouTube Page, Lobs Paalga TV. The YouTube video with the caption  “Vidéo d’un exode attribué aux habitants de Solhan” showed this is not a Nigerian language. So we used Google Translate to get its meaning.  The translation reads, “Video of an exodus attributed to the inhabitants of Solhan”. On June 6, 2021, BBC reported that armed men killed at least 160 people in an attack on a village in northern Burkina Faso. Solhan was attacked by the reported armed men. On the same day the YouTube video was posted, Al Jazeera reported that more than 7,000 families had fled their homes in Burkina Faso’s northern region following the area’s worst massacre in years. Our findings show this video is footage of fleeing residents of Solhan village in Burkina Faso, not residents of Niger State as claimed by the Facebook users. Hence, it is false.

Claim: A viral post making rounds on social media has a claim that FUOYE management has declared tutorials and instructed the university’s students to resume.,"On Sunday 17th April, an announcement started circulating on  WhatsApp groups and other social media platforms in relation to the students of Federal University Oye-Ekiti (FUOYE). The narrative was that the university management, under the leadership of Professor Sunday Abayomi, has “declared tutorials and instructed students to resume on the 27th of April, 2022. The post added that the information was made public in “a statement signed and made available to pressmen by the Registrar of FUOYE, Mr. Ganiyu Oke Saliu,” on Thursday 14th April, 2022. The viral announcement further alleged that the tutorial became necessary in order to prepare students for the university’s examination which would commence as soon as the Academic Staff Union of Universities’ (ASUU) strike is called off. While some students doubt the accuracy of such an announcement, other students already tired of the continuous strike wish it was true. An example is one Oyinkansola who wished the message was real. “It should be real ooooo… I’m tired of staying at home,” Oyinkansola wrote. Recently, DUBAWA fact-checked a similar announcement that was also eventually confirmed by the university’s vice-chancellor to be fake.  The clear grammatical errors found in the body of the claim is the first red flag. Aside from the practice of official statements from the school being circulated in a memorandum format,  there is inaccuracy in the identity of the registrar.  Currently, Federal University Oye-Ekiti (FUOYE) has an Acting Registrar whose name is different from the one that allegedly signed the circulating claim. Mufutau A. Ibrahim is the name of FUOYE’s Acting Registrar. He also provided a copy of the souvenir that was distributed at the university’s convocation ceremony, held in December, 2021. Searching for the name, “Ganiyu Oke Saliu” on Google, DUBAWA came across a March, 2022 news article that referred to the bearer as the Registrar of Olusegun Agagu University of Science & Technology (OAUSTECH) located in Okitipupa, Ondo state. Also, during a visit to the university’s website, DUBAWA found another news article that referred to Mr. Ganiyu as the Registrar of OAUSTECH. The Students’ Union Public Relations Officer of FUOYE, Adedokun Abolore, also debunked this viral claim through his WhatsApp status. He advised the students to always visit the union’s social media outlets for information. Also, Dubawa contacted Wole Balogun, the Special Adviser to the VC on Media Matters who also debunked the claim.  “It is not possible, ASUU is on strike. We cannot do anything in school because ASUU is on strike now. This is not just possible at all,” Mr Balogun said. He further clarified that “the Acting Registrar of FUOYE is Mr. Ibrahim Mufutau and not one Ganiu Oke Saliu. ” The information being circulated about the resumption of Federal University Oye-Ekiti (FUOYE) for tutorials during the current ASUU strike is false. The Special Adviser to the VC on media matters has debunked the claim. He said that the school cannot resume until the current Academic Staff Union of Universities’ (ASUU) strike is called off. Not only that, the alleged Registrar whose name was used as the signatory of the information is not of FUOYE.

Claim: A viral video of a man hitting a woman with a pressing iron is alleged to be the scene of Osinachi’s enduring domestic violence by her husband.,"Social media went agog with different narratives when late Nigerian gospel singer, Osinachi Nwachukwu, was announced dead at an Abuja hospital. Osinachi, who was the lead singer at the Dunamis International Gospel Centre, was initially said to have died from cancer of the throat. However, floods of information and testimonials from social media and some of her close family relatives later alleged the singer was killed by her husband on account of domestic violence which late Osinachi has long been enduring for some time.  Fueled by this trend, a video of a man hitting a certain woman with a pressing iron surfaced on WhatsApp and other social media platforms. The footage depicts an apparently irate man hitting a woman with what appears to be a pressing iron. The helpless woman, who is heard screaming in the presence of crying children, is further chased by the man to another room, bringing the 11 seconds video to an abrupt end.  The man  is alleged to be Osinachi’s husband domestically abusing her and the caption also suggests the footage was covered by her son.  “Video of Osinachi’s husband beating her, recorded by their son. How can a man being an animal be beating his wife this way, your woman mother of your children, how can this idiot deny that he didn’t have a hand in killing his wife Osinachi. Mr Peter Nwachukwu,” the attached caption points out.  In one WhatsApp group where the video was shared, some users shared their disappointment with Osinachi’s husband, tagging him a “demon” and an “iron man” for beating her with pressing iron.  “This man is a demon. How can you beat your wife with a pressing stone? No wonder she couldn’t survive it. May her soul rest in peace,” one user wrote.  Since the passing of the gospel singer, multiple narratives have been flying around with no factual basis. While this is usual with trending events,  some people can capitalise on it to propagate unfounded reality that may sometimes stir up fear or even rage in the society.  When DUBAWA ran an analysis of the alleged footage on InVid Video verifier, results show the footage exists since 2020 with a different narrative that has nothing to do with the late gospel singer.  In fact, DUBAWA traced the earliest appearance of the video to a Twitter user, David (@Davidnart) who shared the footage on June 21st, 2020 with the caption:  “This is extremely wicked by this man. I hope he gets locked up for life. Wicked bastard.” Not just that, another Twitter user, z̲̣̥μ̥β̣̣̥γ (@zubykelz) on June 31st, 2020 also shared the footage with the narrative that the woman in the video has accused the man of rape and not domestic violence.  “Seems Nigerians are confusing Domestic/Physical abuse (Domestic Violence) with Emotional/Sexual Abuse (Rape). For clarity… this video is a case of Domestic violence which she didnt accuse him of… she accused him of Rape. She hasn’t told us any incident of the Rape (s) though,” the caption says.  The same video was also published in a report by Pulse.ng on June 23, 2020 with the headline: “Viral video of man hitting wife’s head with electric iron in front of kids sickens social media users.”  The report details how the “unknown” man in the footage is beating up a woman with a pressing iron. Evidently, none of the places the video was featured in 2020 mentioned the late popular gospel singer or her husband as the persons in the footage.  The alleged video exists since 2020 and has been featured with different narratives that neither mention Osinachi nor her husband. As such, this claim is false. Ok But did u see my question on the post? Someone posted it and I doubted and also posted and asked a question  to it,. Did i stated that the man beating the woman with a pressing iron is osinachi’s husband neither the woman is osinachi? I honestly did not know it wasn’t hers. But even at that what right has a man to beat a woman in such manners? The recently posted video of a man hitting his wife with a pressing iron was not late Osinachi and her husband.. it was false. Is it right for a man to hit a woman that way. .. But I never said it was Osinachi, my point remains that what the woman being beating with pressing iron was passing through was not different from what Osinachi passed through. Hence, no man beating his wife should be given fair hearing I didn’t really know it was her. I shared it because it was a serious domestic violence and the man (not minding if it’s Oshinachi’s) must be arrested and brought to book. That’s the reason I shared it. I didn’t really know it was her. The reason I didn’t mention her name in my post. I shared it because it was a serious domestic violence and the man (not minding if it’s Oshinachi’s) must be arrested and brought to book. That’s the reason I shared it. Thanks for the clearity. Partly false information found in your post… Question is, did I make the post or felt pity why an husband can be cruel to his wife by bartering her. Don’t know if your sanctions are computer generated but you should go after the culprit of the post rather than sympathisers. It’s unjust to acclaim I made a post when I didn’t.

Claim: A Facebook post claims almonds are an alternative to aspirin in relieving headaches.,"Almonds are seeds of Prunus dulcis, commonly called the almond tree. Almond nuts contain vitamins, minerals, protein, and fibre with several health benefits. A Facebook user Mike De HotGenius odu shared an image with the claim that  almonds are an alternative to aspirins in the relief of headaches. According to the image, 10-12 almonds is the equivalent of two aspirins. DUBAWA researched almonds and aspirins with focus on their properties to see if we can find common properties. Aspirin, also known as acetylsalicylic acid, is a medication used to relieve minor aches, pains, and fevers. It is also used as an anti-inflammatory or a blood thinner.  Its use was first recorded around 4,000 years ago. Aspirin is a Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drug (NSAID) and the first of this class of drug to be discovered. It contains salicylate, a compound found in plants like willow tree and myrtle. Aspirin is synthesised by the action of salicylic acid on acetic anhydride. It is an esterification reaction. In this reaction, when salicylic acid reacts with acetic anhydride, the hydroxyl group of salicylic acid converts into an ester group. This results in Aspirin and acetic acid. Almonds are edible nuts that can be eaten raw, toasted as a snack or added to dishes. Almonds are also available in sliced, flaked, slivered forms or as flour, oil, butter, or almond milk. A Handful of almonds (1 ounce of almonds) contain one-eighth of an individual’s daily protein needs.  This report by healthline highlights 9 evidence-based health benefits of almonds. They include its high nutrient value, antioxidant content, vitamin E, its ability to control blood sugar, and its magnesium content which benefits blood pressure. Almonds also help lower cholesterol level, prevent harmful oxidation of LDL cholesterol, lower overall calorie intake as it reduces hunger, and are effective for weight loss.  This article explains that the reason why almonds are said to relieve headaches is because of its salicin (salicylate) content.  Salicin is a naturally occurring compound found in the bark of several species of trees.  It is an anti-inflammatory component found in aspirin while magnesium helps ease nerves and muscles that are caused by stress. A keyword search led to a report by The Indian Express which highlighted foods like Almond can relieve headache. Another article by abcNEWS identified almonds as one of the top five headache-healing foods. Similarly, another article on how to prepare almonds for headaches noted almonds are effective against headaches because they contain salicin and magnesium.  Contrary to this, an article by Cleveland clinic named almonds as one of the foods that can cause/trigger headaches in susceptible people. We found a 2001 study which showed salicylate inhibits prostaglandin production in vivo (research done with or within  a living organism); it only weakly inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 or -2 activity in vitro (research outside a Living organism).  A 2015 study noted headache is one of the illnesses almonds have been used to cure traditionally but the research did not look into this aspect. However, a study in 2020, noted that overuse of salicylates in all forms may cause headaches. We also found a fact-check by thipmedia which rated this as half true. One of the experts quoted in this fact-check, Dr Saurabh Gaba, an associate consultant, internal Medicine, Paras Hospitals, Panchkula, dispelled this claim as a myth.  “The claim that almonds can replace aspirin in curing some health conditions is a myth. Though almonds are considered as healthy food, there is no scientific evidence that can prove their use as a remedy in headaches,” the fact-check reads.  These articles still leave us with the question whether almonds relieve or trigger headaches. So we spoke to some experts. A senior registrar at the National Hospital in Abuja, Jeremiah Agim, said this is new to him and that he has no experience with almond use. He also said that he would not recommend its use because it is not standardised.  “I don’t have personal experience with it. Even if I have, I can not recommend it to a patient until it has been standardised,” he added.  Another medical officer, Arinze Obiadazie, said there is no scientific evidence almonds cure headaches.  “…there’s no evidence based medicine or scientific proof to almonds curing headaches,” he said . He also noted that a headache is not a diagnosis but a symptom that can be caused by different medical conditions, thus making it important to seek the cause before treatment.  “Headache isn’t a diagnosis, it’s a symptom, a pointer to something possibly sinister. So it’s ill-advised to try to suppress a headache, especially if it’s not stress related. There are a thousand causes of headaches, from stress to a brain bleed. It’s advisable to seek treatment and try to identify this cause and treat accordingly, as opposed to eating almonds,” he added. Our findings and experts’ perspectives reveal that although almonds and aspirin contain salicin,  there is no scientific proof almonds cure headaches and if it can be an alternative to aspirin. This makes the claim false.  ",false,15/04/2022,https://dubawa.org/are-almonds-alternative-to-aspirins-for-treatment-of-headaches/
Claim: A Twitter user claimed drinking water while eating is not good for the body.,"A Twitter user, Sirwoley (@SirWoley) recently claimed that drinking water while eating is not good for the body. He advised that water should either be taken 30 minutes before a meal or an hour after.  “Just found out drinking water while eating isn’t so good for the body. So You either Take water 30 minutes before a meal or 1 hour after Eating,” he tweeted.   One Twitter user, ayo bami  (@olufowose_ayo) commented affirming the claim but noted it’s difficult to practice.  Another user, Sweet Nectar (@Lily_retta), however, requested the source of the claim.  “This is actually true but it’s easier said than done,” @izu_sylva commented. ODINAKA (@SolomonOdinaka2), another Twitter user, shared the same claim. This Tweet by @SirWoley, who has more than 18,000 followers, attracted 28 retweets and 66 likes since the claim was shared while that of  @solomonOdinaka2 got no reactions. Due to the virality of the claim and the controversies surrounding it, DUBAWA chose to verify this claim. DUBAWA first conducted a keyword search which showed that USA Today fact-checked a similar claim in 2020, where it refuted the claim. Healthline, a popular health blog, explained that there are three main arguments people make to claim that drinking liquids with meals is bad for your digestion. The first argument is that drinking acidic or alcoholic beverages with meals causes the saliva to dry up, making it more difficult for the body to digest food. Saliva flow is reduced by 10–15 percent with each unit of alcohol consumed. However, this only applies to hard liquor, not the modest alcohol content of beer and wine, according to a study by PubMed Central. The second argument is that drinking water with meals dilutes stomach acid and digestive enzymes, making digestion more difficult. According to a study by PubMed Central, liquids pass through your digestive system more quickly than solids, so they have no effect on the digestion speed of solid food. The third common reason against drinking liquids with meals is that the combination speeds up the passage of solid foods through the stomach. Similarly, a study refuted the claim that the human body’s digestive system is incapable of adapting its secretions to the consistency of a meal. Meanwhile, an Indian blog, Entertainment Times, reported that water between meals is bad for the body. Due to the differences in opinion, we sought the opinion of experts. Adedeji Moses, a clinical nutritionist who is the  Lead Director of Adedamz Nutrition Consult, revealed that the human body is perfect for drinking water either during or after a meal. “Whether you drink your water before, during or after a meal, it doesn’t matter. The time you drink your water when eating your food has nothing to do with an individual’s digestive process,” he said. Emmanuel Oyebamiji, a dietitian-nutritionist at University College Hospital, Ibadan, also said that water can be taken while eating. “Though we have a school of thought that says when you take water while eating, it occupies where food should stay, but it is false, you can have your water in-between your meal,” he explained. Studies have shown that drinking water while eating is not bad for the body. Experts have also revealed that it doesn’t matter if water is taken before, during or after eating. Hence, the claim is false.  ",FALSE,15/04/2022,https://dubawa.org/does-drinking-water-while-eating-pose-danger-to-the-body/
Claim: A Facebook user claims that Bukola Saraki was beaten up by a mob of protesters in the streets of the United Kingdom.,"Claim: A Facebook user claims that Bukola Saraki was beaten up by a mob of protesters in the streets of the United Kingdom. The claim that a mob of protesters beat Bukola Saraki in the streets of the United Kingdom is misleading. The video has existed since 2019 and has been used to paint different narratives. This claim is misleading. Olubukola Abubakar Saraki, popularly known as Bukola Saraki, is a Nigerian politician who served as the 13th President of the Nigerian Senate from 2015 to 2019. Prior to his election to the senate in 2011, he served as two-term governor of Kwara State. In his service years, Saraki was and still remains a point of controversy, mostly around corruption allegations which he has vehemently contested. Recently, a footage making rounds on Facebook has a claim that the politician was attacked and beaten by a mob of protesters in the streets of the United Kingdom. The video was shared by a Facebook user, Joy Ese Joshua, accompanied with the caption that labels the man in the footage as Saraki. “Bukola Saraki received the beating of his life in the hands of the Nigerian diaspora on the streets of: UK. nemesis has caught up with the shameless rogue.” Viewed almost 70 thousand times by users, it attracted massive reactions and was re-shared over 30 thousand times by users on Facebook.   Having no doubts whatsoever about the claim, some users who commented said the ex-lawmaker deserved the beating, some added that the man is truly Saraki when he travelled with Atiku to London back in 2019: “It was him but not of recent, 2019 when he went with Atiku,” Michael Ajibola commented. Some users felt otherwise, tagging the post as outright “fake news”: “This is fake news,” Temitope Akinwumi wrote. Politicians have always been a topic of controversy, especially when elections are underway. When DUBAWA ran an analysis of the acclaimed video on InVid video verifier, results show that the footage has been featured on different occasions with different narratives. On YouTube and Facebook, the video was shared with the claim that Tinubu’s son was attacked and beaten up in London. This was in October 2020, during the #EndSars protest in Nigeria, where major politicians such as Tinubu were criticised for the years of bad leadership and police brutality in Nigeria. The same footage also appeared on this Facebook page with multiple views and reactions. Shared in 2019, the narrative here also claims the man in the video is the Governor of Kinshasa who went shopping in Paris but was attacked by the Congolese people. “Kinshasa Governor went shopping in Paris. His Congolese people resident there waited outside for him to finish and pounced on him,” the caption reads. In 2019, around the time the video first emerged, members of the Congolese community held a protest when President Félix Tshisekedi visited Paris. Bukola Saraki is a prominent person in Nigeria. Such an event should have attracted wide media attention. However,  this was not captured on any mainstream media nor even on blog sites. This is usually a major red flag for misleading information.  The alleged video has been in existence since 2019 and has been used to paint different narratives at different times with no reference to any actual source.  As such, this claim is misleading.  Thank you for the patriotic job Thank you so much for this excellent discovery and correction. May God punish those who post false informations on Facebook.

Claim: A Facebook user claims drone footage of bandits is from Nigeria.,"With recent events like the Abuja-Kaduna train attack, and the attempted attack on the Kaduna Airport,  security has remained a top priority for many Nigerians. On Tuesday, March 5, 2022, a member of the All Progressive Congress (APC), Joe Igbokwe, shared a video. He accompanied the video with the claim that it is a footage of bandits who have been kidnapping Nigerians.  “This is drone footage of armed bandits who have been kidnapping Nigerians. The footage shows them in their hideout in an unknown forest,” part of the post read. This post already has over 1,000 shares and 31 comments.  We have also observed that this video is being shared on WhatsApp groups with different narratives on the location. We looked at the video to understand its content and context but could not because the video had no audio. However, we observed there are five men in this video and one of the men was holding what looked like an AK-47.  A Google reverse image search on different frames of the video did not provide any helpful leads; therefore, we did a manual search.  On Facebook, we found posts with this video and its claim here, here and here. We also found a post on Twitter by AF News (@AFNewsNG) with the same claim.  However, we found a Facebook Post with a different narrative that this video is from Kenya. “Bandits spotted by a super drone,” the post read. A Twitter post by Madoka Kibet (@Madoka_ke) also contained the video below. This Tweet was, however, deleted shortly after it was found. “Security Surveillance Drone ambushes Kalenjin bandits inside Baragoi forest. An Irritated bandit is seen unsuccessfully trying to shoot down the drone,” part of the Twitter post reads. A YouTube video by Voice Tv Nigeria on Monday April 5,2022, noted this was a video of bandits spotted by a drone in Laikipia.  An earlier YouTube video by Trending Videos Kenya on Sunday, April 3, 2022, noted this was a video of Pikot bandits captured by a drone inside their hideout in Laikipia forest.  Laikipia is one of the 47 counties of Kenya located on the equator in the former rift valley province of the country.  Screenshot of Laikipia on Google Map We also found a report by BBC pidgin which debunked the claim that this video was from Nigeria. Our findings show this video is not from Nigeria; it first appeared as drone footage from Laikipia, Kenya. This makes the claim false.

Claim: A Facebook user claims onions absorb bacteria and cut onions are poisonous.,"A Facebook post by Kunle Alade claims that onions absorb bacteria which is why they help prevent colds and flu. In the post, Mr Alade claimed this was discovered during the flu pandemic in 1919, by an unnamed doctor  “Onions ABSORB BACTERIA* and that is the reason why they are so good at preventing us from getting colds & flu,” part of the post read.  The post advised against eating an onion that has been sliced and left open for a while because they are poisonous.  We looked at onion and its properties and also carried out a keyword search.  Onions known as allium cepa, are bulb-shaped vegetables that grow underground. They vary in size, shape, colour, and flavour but the most common types are red, yellow, and white onions. A keyword search led to an analysis by McGill Office for Science and Society, which showed onions are not bacteria prone or bacteria magnets because they have a variety of sulphur compounds with antibacterial activity.   This report also noted that sliced onions left open are not poisonous unless it was sliced on a contaminated cutting board, or handled with dirty hands. This can, however, be prevented with good food practices like washing of hands, kitchen tools and wiping down counters with sanitizer before beginning food preparation, to avoid introducing outside contamination. This practice extends to the preparation of every other food item, not just onions.  The report also noted that contamination by some sort of mould is possible, because mould spores can travel through the air.  Cookinglight article also disagrees with the claim that cut onion is poisonous. We found an article by the National Onion Association (NOA) which debunked several myths about onions including the claim that cut onions are poisonous. The association noted that when handled properly, cut onions are not poisonous and can be stored in the refrigerator in a sealed container for up to 7 days. A study on the antibacterial action of onion extracts against oral pathogenic bacteria showed onion extracts possess an effect on all bacterial strains. This article by verywellhealth.com noted there is no proof that onion can help prevent the flu or the common cold as claimed in this post. It also revealed that the idea of keeping raw onions in the room when sick dates back to the 1500s, according to the NOA.  Our search also led to fact-checks by USA Today, snopes, Wall Street Journal, and Associated Press clarifying that leaving an onion around the house won’t fight or prevent illness/flu because they don’t absorb bacteria. Our findings show there is no proof onions can absorb bacteria. Placing onions around the house won’t help fight the flu. It is the immune system’s attack on invading viruses or bacteria entering the body that helps the body recover from sickness. It is also not true that cut onions are poisonous as they can even be stored in the refrigerator in a sealed container for up to seven days. The claims are therefore false.

"Claim: In a viral WhatsApp message, it was announced that the Vice Chancellor of Federal University Oye-Ekiti (FUOYE) has instructed the University’s students to prepare for exams.","On the first day of April, a certain announcement appeared on WhatsApp  that the Vice Chancellor of Federal University Oye-Ekiti, Prof. Abayomi Fasina, has “warned” all students of the varsity to prepare for exams.  The message was making the rounds in the form of a news story, with the headline: “Prepare ahead your exams FUOYE VC warns all students of the University.” The announcement, coming at a period  when the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) is on strike has sparked reactions from some students who fear that the school would truly begin examinations immediately the strike is called off. When one user who shared the information on WhatsApp was asked about the actual source of the information, he admitted some doubts about the accuracy of the information  but confessed that he still decided to share it for fun. However,  he shared a link to a similar report that neither stated the source of the information nor a direct quotation from the Vice Chancellor. Below is the conversation between Dubawa and the claimant: April 1st is notorious for “expensive” jokes and hoaxes that sometimes mislead unsuspecting members of the public on the premise of “April fool.” On such a day, friends play pranks on each other to commemorate the month just for fun. However, if not handled with care, those jokes could become hurtful information, a more reason why DUBAWA opted to fact-check the claim in question.  A click on the link provided by the claimant took Dubawa to a website named “Prank Mania.” It is a site that permits any visitor to personally “create pranks” which can be shared on “WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, and other social media.” Among many false headlines that have been created with this tool, the claim in question quickly popped up at the top, with hyperlinked instructions that asked Dubawa to “CREATE YOUR PRANK OR SHARE THIS PRANK.” The claim in question Although the website warned its users not to take its contents seriously, the negative impact this has on the public may be unmeasurable. This is because social media users barely click, before believing news headlines. To further verify this news, Dubawa contacted the Vice Chancellor of Federal University Oye-Ekiti (FUOYE), Prof. Abayomi Fasina who discredited the claim. Through Mr. Wole Balogun, his Special Adviser on Media Matters, Mr Fasina said in a telephone conversation: “It is not true. As a federal institution, it’s not possible for us to do anything when there is an ASUU strike.” In addition to the Vice Chancellor’s debunking of the claim, the headline was created with “Prank Mania,” a site that allows users to create and share false information. The claim is therefore false. ",false,04/04/2022,https://dubawa.org/fuoye-vc-did-not-ask-students-to-prepare-for-exams-during-asuu-strike/
Claim: A Twitter user claimed that the Federal University DUTSIN-MA in Katsina State has banned Sunday activities for Christians on campus.,"A Twitter user, @FestusGreen, on Monday, March 7, 2022, shared an information that the Federal University DUTSIN-MA has banned the believers of Christ from organizing Sunday activities on the university’s campus. The claimant attached a memo, purportedly issued by the university, to the tweet that Tuesdays and Wednesdays are approved days for church services besides Sunday, a general day. The post has generated over 900 retweets, sparking reactions from many Nigerians. A commenter, @UchennaObiora resonated with the tweet, saying that the same thing happened at Umaru Musa Yar’adua University about which Nigerians kept mute. @_Sarah_Emmanuel, however, disagreed with the tweet. She said, “You guys won’t read something we will before posting. Where was it written that religious activities are banned on Sunday?” Radio Biafra, a Facebook page, also shared the claim which has attracted over 200 shares. As a result of the controversy and over 900 likes on the tweet and reactions, it is important DUBAWA fact-check the claim and inform Nigerians. DUBAWA uncovered that some bloggers have also made the same claim on their websites. For example, Siggy and News Spot Nigeria all shared the information. However, the Punch Newspaper, a reputable daily in Nigeria, reported that the management denied the restriction of Christian students’ worship hours. When DUBAWA spoke to The Punch, Director of Public Relations and Protocol, Habibu Matazu, stressed that their report was accurate and the alleged memo from FUDMA is fake.  The institution soon issued a press in line with The Punch’s report, dispelling  the ban of Christian students from church services on Sundays. Beyond the press release, DUBAWA reached out to Stephen Shekari, the president of the National Fellowship of Evangelical Students, FUDMA. Shekari, in a phone interview,  revealed that it was not a total ban of Christian students’ activities on campus but a reduction of the fellowship days from three to two. “Our meeting days which were initially three days a week were reduced to two days. Saturday, which seemed to be our major meeting day as students, was taken out of which it affected us largely,” he said. The president noted that Saturday is an important day for the fellowship, because they don’t meet on Sundays due to the fact that the university chapel comprising both students and staff members use the venue every Sunday. “It was our weekly activities that were shortened. The weekly activities were what we all were lamenting about not Sunday service as a whole,” he affirmed. The alleged claim making rounds in the form of a memo is misleading.   The university chapel still uses Sunday for their activities and only the days of worship or meeting were shortened.

Claim: Some users on Facebook and Twitter claim that the IMF has rated Nigeria as the 25th best economy out of 195 countries in the world.,"Established in 1944, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is an (international) organization that is made up of 190 countries – which is “near-global membership.” With its headquarters at Washington, the organization works to foster global economic development, financial stability, and to facilitate international trade and reduce poverty among member countries. The IMF, through its continuous monitoring, gathers data on national (and global) economies. Furthermore, it constantly provides and updates economic forecasts at the national and global level. These forecasts are published in the World Economic Outlook. In addition, the IMF supports its member countries with loans and capacity development. Recently, a Facebook post has been widely shared with a claim that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said that Nigeria is now rated 25th best economy in the world. And beneath the post is an assertion that Nigeria was at no. 150 during PDP’s regime. Further Facebook search by DUBAWA also revealed that this same post has been repeatedly posted in a different format but with same narrative. One even alleged that both Channels and AIT televisions will not report “this good news.” It reads: “BREAKING! Nigeria Now Rated 25th Best Economy in The World Out of 195 Countries. Channels and AIT Won’t Report this good news.” Not only has this post been widely circulated by Facebook users, it has also been tweeted by Fortunate Ayoade who repeated the same narrative. Asides the questions, some users have raised over the credibility of the information, the claim has also generated different kinds of debate and banter among political loyalists on Facebook. The 2023 election is not too far,  and as usual, this season usually comes along with wild claims that sometimes form part of a major public controversy.  As striking as the claim appears, DUBAWA discovered that such news has not been reported by any media outlet. However, a story that looks similar  was published on December 29, 2020 by Nigerian Tribune. It reported Nigeria’s economy to have been ranked 1st in Africa and 26th in the world by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). To further establish this fact,  DUBAWA contacted Dataphyte through an email. Dataphyte is a “media research and data analytics organization with the mission to deploy data tools and technology for the socio-economic development of Nigeria.” Based on the available GDP data of IMF, Dataphyte confirmed that Nigeria is not currently ranked 25th best economy in the world. However, they added that it has never been  rated below 50th throughout the 16 years regime of the PDP. Dataphyte, however, mentioned that its submission “is based on two of the most referenced IMF ranking methods (a) Gross domestic product, based on current prices in Billions (U.S. dollars) AND (b) Gross Domestic Product, based on the Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)”.  Also, the organization attached Nigeria’s ranking and GDP values for the period of 1999 to 2022, as more information on the data. IMF Data received through Datapyte reveals that  Nigeria is not ranked as the 25th, rather, it is currently ranked 27th largest economy in the world. The claim that Nigeria was recently rated 25th best economy in the world is not true. Also, the assertion that Nigeria’s economy was rated 150 during PDP’s regime is false. Data provided by Dataphyte revealed that Nigeria has never been ranked below 50 between 1999 and 2022.

Claim: Social media users have claimed continually over the years that the combination of milk and malt increases blood volume.,"It is a popular belief that the combination of malt and milk increases blood volume. As such, internet users have shared such information on the internet. For example, in 2017, a member of Nairaland shared that the combination of malt and milk increase blood volume.  Similarly in 2020, Zikoko, a popular blog in Nigeria, shared some of the homemade means Nigerian mothers use to increase their children’s blood volume. Malt and milk combination came first on the supposed list. In 2021, another news website shared that the combination gives blood. The website shared that hospitals give blood donors the combination to increase their blood volume. Meanwhile, in a popular Nollywood movie starring Odunlade Adekola and Olaniyi Afonja, the former made a similar claim in the movie which could have added to the prominence of milk and malt combination as a blood tonic. How true is this? Does the combination of malt and milk increase blood volume? DUBAWA first conducted a keyword search which led to some of the reports highlighted above. This shows this claim is popular but our research on this claim did not yield any result.  We, therefore, sought the opinion of experts on the issue. A Professor of Public Health Nutrition at Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Osun State, Beatrice Ogunba, revealed to Punch that there is no scientific evidence to the assertion made by some Nigerians that combining malt and milk boosts blood volume. Adedeji Moses, a clinical nutritionist who is the  Lead Director of Adedamz Nutrition Consult, also revealed to DUBAWA that the combination of malt and milk does not, in any way, increase blood volume in the body. “Though it has been seen in many hospitals after people have donated their blood, milk  and malt, or the combination of both were given to blood to donors. So, people believe they were given those items to replenish and boost the blood they have donated.” Mr Adedeji noted that people can take the combination and still be short of blood.  “This can happen if the individual is not consuming food sources that are rich in iron, copper, folate and vitamin C,” he said. The clinical nutritionist explained that though milk contains calcium, vitamin D and other important nutrients which are good for the development of healthy bones, it is also a good source of protein. Malt, on the other hand, is a good energy source.  “They are packed with important vitamins and proteins. It alleviates stress, improves digestion and also improves heart health by lowering bad cholesterol in the body. But it must be known that either milk or malt or a combination of both cannot boost or produce blood,” the nutritionist added. Emmanuel Oyebamiji, a dietitian-nutritionist at University College Hospital, Ibadan logo University College Hospital, Ibadan, also said that milk and malt combination does not provide the body with blood. “Though milk is rich in calcium and iron, not all milk is rich in that, don’t forget we have different types of milk,” he said. This claim is false as we could not find studies to back it up and professional nutritionists say the combination does not increase blood volume.

Claim: A group on Facebook shared pictures of some people it claimed are Africans maltreated at the Polish border due to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war.,"After Russia launched an invasion of Ukraine, millions of Ukrainian residents have been making efforts to migrate to neighbouring countries for safety. This situation, described as the worst since the Second World war, triggered concerns from around the world. However, when the African Union (AU) said it was “disturbed” by reports that African nationals in Ukraine are being prevented from safely crossing the border to flee the raging conflict in the country, the situation opened up doors for diverse narratives, especially pertaining to the lingering issue of racism in Europe. It was amidst this context that a page on Facebook, “Biafra Defense Force” claims that Africans fleeing Ukraine are being dehumanised at the borders of neighbouring countries, particularly pointing out the Polish border, as a point of reference.  The post is accompanied by a picture of some people described as Africans at a certain European border.   “BREAKING  16-03-2022 No Reasonable African man can stand with Ukraine “This is Russia and Ukraine war. Africans are treated like this. Whites are already in Poland Living peacefully. Then some Mugu Leaders are saying “we are with Ukraine, we stand with Ukraine”. Africans, no one cares for you if you are Black African. Look into the Picture yourself,” the post read.  The claim triggered diverse reactions with multiple comments that appear sympathetic towards the people in the picture. One user, Omomor Donatus, expressed his disappointment with African leaders, attributing the situation to bad leadership.  “I deeply feel your pains, is all caused by our bad/tyrant leaders and mumu youths that are eating from their scrub supporting them,” he commented.  Since the start of the crisis in Ukraine, multiple reports have been tied around multimedia contents that DUBAWA had found to be misleading, a good reason this claim demands verification.  When DUBAWA ran a Yandex reverse image on the pictures, results show that all three of the images were featured on Getty Images. Also, the details attached to the pictures reveal people depicted in the picture were African migrants who were held by the Spanish authorities while trying to cross the border into Spain from Morocco.  “This video grab shows migrants arriving at the Temporary Centre for Immigrants and Asylum Seekers (CETI) in Melilla after jumping the border fence separating Spain’s Melilla enclave from Morocco on March 2, 2022,” reads the caption of one of the images. “Around 1,200 migrants tried to storm the border separating Spain’s Melilla enclave from Morocco on March 3, 2022, with 380 getting across, a day after the biggest such attempt on record.” Although the people in the pictures are Africans, they were not held at the Polish border due to the crisis in Ukraine.

Claim: A Facebook post claims a person can have children not linked to his or her DNA because the person has two or more cells.,"Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is the hereditary material in humans and almost all other organisms. It is used to carry out paternity tests which has become a topic of discussion in Nigeria with the recent rise in cases of  paternity fraud. Amidst this, several Facebook users have claimed that it is possible for a DNA test not to link a father and a child because one person can have two DNA.  A Facebook post by Princess Jessy-Doo claims an individual can have two or more sets of cells and children that are not linked to him or her by DNA.  “A human chimera may likely produce kids who are not linked to his DNA since he is having two or more sets of cells” part of the Facebook post read. Another post by Lene Temitope notes how DNA results can be tricky, urging parents to carry out their own DNA test to be sure none of them is a Chimera. The comments under this post were a mixture of awe, confusion and disbelief. One Facebook user, Aondofa Shedrack, said he still won’t believe this, noting that if it’s not his DNA then it’s nothing. Another user, Iji Silas, however, appreciated the poster for sharing.  Is this true? What are the odds, how does this work? These questions prompted us to do this check.  We researched the topic chimerism and how it works and also spoke to experts on the issue. What is Chimerism? Chimerism is a rare condition in which a person’s body contains two different sets of DNA. This condition is believed to be quite rare as only about 100 or so cases of chimerism have been recorded in modern medical literature. Chimerism can also affect animals.  So an animal or human that has the cells of two or more individuals is known as a chimera. The bodies of chimaeras contain two different sets of DNA. Chimerism has different types with different causes and symptoms. The types include microchimerism, artificial chimerism, twin chimerism, and tetragametic Chimarism This type of chimerism commonly occurs when a pregnant woman absorbs a few cells from her foetus. The opposite can also happen, where a foetus absorbs a few cells from its mother. These cells may travel into the mother’s or foetus’s bloodstream and migrate to different organs. The cells may remain in a mother’s body or a child’s body for a decade or more after  childbirth. This type of chimerism can occur when a person receives a blood transfusion, stem cell transplant, or bone marrow transplant from another person and absorbs some of that person’s cells. Today, the treatment of transfused blood with radiation helps the transfusion or transplant recipient better absorb the new cells without permanently incorporating them into their body. The more extreme and most talked about in Nigeria in recent times is twin Chimerism. This type occurs when a pair of twins is conceived but one embryo dies in the womb and the surviving foetus absorbs some of the cells of its deceased twin. This gives the surviving foetus two sets of cells (its own cells and some of its twin’s). This type occurs when two different sperm cells fertilise two different egg cells which fuse together into one human embryo with crossed cell lines. The symptoms of chimerism vary from one person to another and many with this condition do not show signs, or do not recognize these signs as chimerism.  These symptoms include: We found some reported cases of Chimerism in a California singer, Taylor Muhl, a United States (US) man, and a woman named Lydia Fairchild in Washington. These cases reveal different ways chimerism can present. Dr Okpanachi Achile, a medical officer at  Rehoboth Specialist Hospital Lokoja, noted several postulations for chimerism from vanishing twin to bone marrow transplant.  He explained that in vanishing twins syndrome, the living twin absorbs the remainder of the dead twin and if the twins are fraternal twins,  they are two different individuals and DNAs.  “The absorbed tissue being a stem cell may retain its original identity/DNA leading to a chimera DNA. Similarly in bone marrow transplant (bone marrow is also a stem cell) a chimera may occur” he said.  A gynaecologist at the National Hospital Abuja, Dr Jeremiah Agim, said this is not a new discovery and it can be a challenge when there is a paternity dispute because not all cells of the body may have the two genotypes.  “It’s not new, it’s all about finding two genotypes in an individual’s  cell. This can occur when twins fuse together at the zygote stage. So, not all the cells of the body might have the two genotypes.  “This is a challenge in cases where paternity is in dispute. With careful examination of cells from other body regions, similar genotypes can be found. So there must be two genotypes in an individual before chimera DNA can explain why a child is not genetically identical to that individual who is the supposed parent.” Our findings and experts’ opinions have revealed that it is possible for an individual to have two DNA and have children not linked to them by DNA. This is due to a condition known as chimerism. This makes the claim true.  ",image,31/03/2022,https://dubawa.org/is-it-true-one-person-can-have-two-dna-yes-and-heres-all-you-need-to-know/
Claim: A viral WhatsApp message claims the Federal Government had directed all offices to close by 12 noon in solidarity with the Nigerian team.,"The Super Eagles of Nigeria will be playing against the Black Stars of Ghana at the Moshood Abiola National Stadium, Abuja, on Tuesday, March 29, 2022, by 6p.m. This is the Federation of International Football Association (FIFA) World Cup Qatar 2022 playoff final battle between the two countries.  This is believed to be the most anticipated and potentially explosive encounter in the two countries’ 71-year, 58-match rivalry, after the first leg in Kumasi on Friday ended goalless. On Monday, March 28, 2022, a message went viral on WhatsApp claiming the Federal government had announced the closure of all offices at 12 noon in Abuja in solidarity with the Nigerian football match. The message added that the ministry of sports and Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) bought 20,000 tickets for Nigerians. Screenshot of the viral WhatsApp message.  A keyword search led to reports by Premium Times, Channels Television, Pulse Nigeria, etc, which revealed that on Sunday March 27, 2022, the Federal Ministry of Youth and Sports Development and NFF jointly purchased 20, 000 tickets to give out to fans who wish to support the Eagles on Tuesday. The minister, Sunday Dare, said this is aimed at filling the stadium and getting full home support in Tuesday’s final battle against Ghana.  “We will buy 20,000 of the tickets and give to fans at designated centres on Monday and Tuesday morning. We want to ensure maximum support for the Super Eagles by filling up the stands” Premium Times quoted the minister. We also found a circular by the Office of the Head of Service of the Federation, to all permanent secretaries on Monday, March 28, 2022, directing that all offices be closed by 1pm on Tuesday. “There is need to mobilise support for the Nigerian team. Consequently, I am directed to inform you that all offices will be closed at 1:00pm on Tuesday 29th March, 2022” part of the circular read.  The circular titled “FIFA QATAR 2022 WORLD CUP QUALIFIER BETWEEN NIGERIA AND GHANA”, was signed by Ngozi Onwudiwe, the permanent secretary, Service Welfare Office for the head of the Civil Service of the Federation.  Image of the circular. Another circular by the Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) on Monday directs its offices to close by 12noon an hour earlier.  This is to enable staff members to proceed to the national stadium to watch the football match.  The circular was signed by Muhammad Bashir, the director, Human Resource Managment for the permanent secretary of the FCT. “…all offices across the Secretariats, Departments and Agencies of the FCT Administration are to be closed for work by 12:00noon being Tuesday 29th March, 2022.” Screenshot of the circular by FCTA. The ministry took to Twitter to announce that there are different location for free bus to the stadium.  Screenshot of the free bus schedule shared on Twitter. Also the media officer for NFF, Ayo Olu Ibidapo, tweeted that there are designated bus locations for Nigerians to get a ticket and board the bus to the stadium.  “The Ministry of Sports and NFF jointly buys 20,000 tickets for Nigerians. Locate the designated bus closest to your location and get a ticket while boarding the bus” he tweeted. Image share in the Tweet.  Image of the ticket.  Conclusion  While it is true the Federal Government directed offices to close early on Tuesday in solidarity with the Nigerian team, the time of closure is 1pm not 12 noon. This makes the claim misleading.  ",noon,29/03/2022,https://dubawa.org/nigeria-vs-ghana-offices-to-close-by-1p-m-not-12noon/
"Claim: A campus news Facebook page, Campus Catch NG, has a claim that the Federal Government said it would attend to the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) after the National All Progressive Congress’ convention.","Claim: A campus news Facebook page, Campus Catch NG, has a claim that the Federal Government said it would attend to the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) after the National All Progressive Congress’ convention. False. No media platform reported the supposed statement from the Federal Government. The report was only shared by a few pages on Facebook with no primary source of information. The Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) recently extended its initial one-month warning strike, adding two months. The Union and the Federal Government have been in the news since the commencement of the strike. Since the extension, ASUU and the federal government have been trending on social media platforms. As such, different claims and inferences have been made on the issue. Recently, Campus Catch NG posted on Facebook that the Federal Government of Nigeria says it will attend ASUU after the APC National Convention. Enejor O. Samuel, a follower of the page, expressed his dissatisfaction with the supposed news. “Na lie… This is very untrue na…make una no finish this party na,” he said. Similarly, a private group that shares ASUU news shared a similar claim on its group. Ab Laky, a member of the group tagged the news as fake. Over a thousand reactions have met the post shared by Campus Catch NG, with more than 60 shares, hence, DUBAWA chose to fact-check this claim. DUBAWA first carried out a keyword search on the latest news reports on ASUU strike. Another version of the claim was found on Nairaland. The version links the story back to the Campus Catch NG’s Facebook page. Apparently, no media house has reported the supposed statement made by the Federal Government. The latest report on ASUU found on Google doesn’t include the supposed statement made by the Federal Government. We found the National Association of University Students threats to the Federal Government and ASUU in a bid to get them to call off the strike. We could only find pages sharing the supposed statement from the Federal Government. No media house has reported the supposed statement. Where and when the statement was made is nonexistent. Hence, the claim is false. ",FALSE-,27/03/2022,https://dubawa.org/fg-did-not-promise-to-attend-to-asuu-after-apc-convention/
A user on Twitter shared a photograph of a crowded train station he claimed was of  Ukrainians attempting to flee after Russia’s invasion of the country.,"Amidst the ongoing Russia-Ukraine crisis, a user on Twitter, Rotimi Adeosun (RMA), (@adeosunm) tweeted a photograph of a crowded train station he claimed to be the Kharkiv train station in Ukraine. The user implied that the crowd at the train station were Ukrainians attempting to flee the country because of the Russian invasion.  “Behold Kharkiv Railway Station in Ukraine.” Mr Adeosun wrote, “Let warmongers know war is not a child’s play and it is very dangerous.” A screenshot of the alleged claim The same image was also tweeted by NEXTA (@nexta_tv) with the caption:  “Photo of the #Kharkhiv railway station”.  The tweet attracted over 20 thousand reactions and was retweeted by over 9 thousand users across Twitter.  The claim received a plethora of comments; while some users felt sorry for the struggling crowd in the picture, others held distinct opinions.  One user, Yeahnomaybenot (@Yeahnomaybenot), felt the crises will only escalate COVID-19 cases across Europe since the large crowd at the train stations are apparently not abiding by the distancing regulations.  “Sadly, I think this will soon cause a new Covid outbreak/strain. Europe needs to prepare for this hypothetical disaster right away. Ongoing war + millions of refugees + new Covid surge would be devastating to the whole of Europe. If only we could do something to stop the war.” Another user, Brian Postlewait (@cityofpeace) simply feels the situation is a humanitarian disaster.  “Humanitarian disaster. This picture is from Kharkiv #Ukraine️.” he comments.  In the recent past, multiple images and videos were maliciously and falsely used to depict the crises. This reality has misled many and forced others to make decisions based on fake information, thus calling for reasons for this information to be authenticated.   When DUBAWA conducted a Yandex image reverse search on the image, results traced the earliest online appearance of the photograph to a tweet by Tim Mak (@timkmak), who is an Investigative Correspondent for NPR in Ukraine. Mr Mak, who tweeted the photograph on March 7th, captioned that he received the photograph from an aide to the Ukrainian Ministry of Internal Affairs. “An aide to the Ukrainian Ministry of Internal Affairs sends along this photo of the train station in the embattled northeast town of Kharkiv.” Apparently, the incident at the Kharkiv train station truly occurred and was reported by multiple credible media outlets.    In a news report by the Mirror.co.uk, the image was featured alongside the headline: “Thousands of Ukrainians pour into train station fleeing war-ruined Kharkiv” a day after  Tim Mak shared it.  Additionally, several other videos and photographs have surfaced that show a similar scene at the same Kharkiv train station and on the same date as the image was noticed to have appeared (7th March). For example,  a video  from a news report by The Guardian, showed a massive crowd at Kharkiv train station striving to get on board.  To further confirm the authenticity of the photograph, DUBAWA ran a forensic analysis of the alleged picture on Forensically and results show that it was neither doctored nor altered.  The photograph was truly taken in Kharkiv train station during Russia’s invasion of Ukraine,  at a time millions of people were attempting to flee the country. Tim Mak, NPR’s investigative correspondent in Ukraine, was one of the first to share the picture online and he said the news organization received the picture from an aide to the Ukrainian Ministry of Internal Affairs. Hence, this claim is true.  ",true,24/03/2022,https://dubawa.org/is-this-photo-of-crowded-train-station-taken-in-ukraine-as-claimed/
Claim: A user on Facebook shared a video of an acclaimed tug of war between Russian and Ukrainian soldiers amid the ongoing war.,"One user on Facebook with the username, Topic News, shared a video of an acclaimed tug of war between Russian and Ukrainian soldiers amidst the ongoing war in Ukraine. The user accompanied the video with a short description that reads: “One on one tug of war, Russia Vs Ukraine.”  The three minute-video depicted two soldiers with distinct military gear engrossed in a heated tug-of-war contest, surrounded by cheering spectators of other soldiers.  Over 3 million users viewed the video, leaving behind over 62 thousand reactions and close to 3 thousand distinct comments. For most of these users who commented, this video was a heartwarming relief to see enemy soldiers having fun amidst the heated crises.  Maryjane Fernandez, who commented on the post, said the tug of war between the two acclaimed Russian and Ukraine soldiers is better than killing each other. Alicia Ello even added that it is heartwarming to see unity promoted:  “Happy to see this fun time, they have each other so nice if their peace and unity will connect with each other’s heart,” she wrote.  Other users even congratulated the acclaimed Russian and Ukraine soldiers. As one user, Neru Baculi, wrote: “Russian and Ukrainian soldiers. Nice seeing you as friends. God bless you.” While the claim might be a heartwarming aspiration for peace lovers around the world, the Russian-Ukrainian crisis has given rise to multiple misleading information since its start. A good reason DUBAWA is attempting to uncover the veracity of this claim.  DUBAWA first ran a frame-by-frame analysis of the acclaimed video on InVid video verifying tool. The results showed the video was first posted on 22nd March 2012 by a YouTube channel titled “31 Canadian Brigade” with the caption: “One on one soldier Tug of War, Canada vs USA.” The actual video on YouTube offered a detailed description of what the video was about. It was a tug of war between Canadian soldiers and American soldiers.  “Prior to the departure of 31 Canadian Brigade Group (31 CBG) personnel from Camp Atterbury, Indiana, Canadian soldiers observed US National Guard soldiers playing an interesting version of the game Tug of War. 31 CBG soldiers were fascinated by the spectacle and cheered on the competitors. Finally, one young Canadian soldier dared to challenge the hometown crowd, and put national pride on the line. In this video, Master Corporal John Celestino of the Windsor Regiment (left), participates in a game of Tug of War with a US National Guard soldier (right). This version of the game builds esprit de corps and really works the leg muscles,” the description of the video outlines.  Even more, the two competing soldiers depicted in the video had the flags of the United States and Canada on their uniforms.  The actual video was that of American and Canadian soldiers playing tug of war during a joint military exercise back in 2012, and not of Russian and Ukrainian soldiers amidst the ongoing war. As such, this claim is false. ",FALSE-,19/03/2022,https://dubawa.org/old-video-of-us-canadian-soldiers-used-to-depict-war-in-ukraine/
Claim: A viral video on WhatsApp has drawn attention of the public  to a new type of sweet that is believed to kill consumers.,"Claim: A viral video on WhatsApp has drawn attention of the public  to a new type of sweet that is believed to kill consumers.  Although 46 school children were reportedly admitted into a health facility at KwaZulu-Natal for abdominal pains allegedly linked to a sweet called “XPOP Energy Red Dragon lollipop,” none of the children died and the alleged sweet is yet to be confirmed as the cause of their illness. As such,  it cannot be established that a sweet is killing people. This claim is misleading. Sweets, chocolates are cravings for almost every child. A new information spreading appears to heighten the dangers of what sweets can do to children.    In a clip that has been repeatedly forwarded on WhatsApp, an unknown man was seen passionately warning mothers to restrict their little children from buying candies. Speaking in Yorùbá language, he said that a newly produced sweet named “Killer Sweet” is out. He alleged that it has been killing people and is currently the cause of stomach ache for some school children that were seen crying at a health facility which was briefly displayed in the video. The clip of the unknown claimant apparently triggered parents’ concerns, pushing individuals to share the video so that lives can be saved. Although the clip of the man was not found on other social media platforms aside WhatsApp, the part which shows the crying pupils has  largely been redistributed to users on blogs, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.  Apparently, the video has been used to paint different versions of narratives on the internet, all warning parents about a killer sweet that has taken lives. While some narratives say many kids have died, others say hundreds of kids were poisoned. Although unspoken, the degree at which this video is shared signals a looming fear amongst parents, a good reason to authenticate this piece of information.  Multiple reports from credible media outlets reveal that a lollipop has allegedly led to stomach discomfort for 46 pupils in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa on January 31st. However,  the name of the sweet is not “Killer Sweet” as alleged by the unknown claimant in the video but  “XPOP ENERGY RED DRAGON,” produced by Richester Foods.  Soon after the children’s illness was referenced to the Richester food, the Managing Director, Dr Hussein Cassim, in a news report by NEWS24, noted that the company is taking the utmost “caution in managing the situation, and that it has launched a full internal investigation into the matter.” The KwaZulu-Natal Department of Health has confirmed in a press release that “one of its hospitals in Ilembe District treated 46 children from a local primary school, after they had complained abdominal pains” and outrightly debunked the claim that any of the children had died. The Department further disclosed that it is “unable to confirm the cause of this sudden illness” and that the affected children were treated and discharged the same day. Conclusions reached by the Richester food over the matter After its internal investigation, the Richester Foods, manufacturer of the lollipop, has published resolutions on its official Facebook page, emphasising that its product (the XPOP Energy)  could not have  been the cause of the illness.  “We have been selling XPOP Energy Red Dragon lollipop since 2017 and we have not had any complaints about this product in the past 5 years that it has been available to the public,” it posted. The claimant, who only spoke in Yoruba, used the same video of the South African children in the Natal hospital who till today have not been confirmed to have fallen ill for eating the XPOP lollipop.  Although 46 school children were reportedly admitted into a health facility at KwaZulu-Natal for abdominal pains, there’s no credible evidence that links XPOP Energy Red Dragon lollipop to the cause of their illness. As well, the lollipop in question is not a new product. According to Richester Food’s disclaimer, it has been in the market since 2017. The KwaZulu-Natal Department of Health confirmed that none of the affected children has died. This claim is therefore misleading.

Claim: A viral WhatsApp message claims the UN 2019 first quarter report shows there are 7.8 billion people on earth with 5.6 billion women and 2.2 billion men.,"Claim: A viral WhatsApp message claims the UN 2019 first quarter report shows there are 7.8 billion people on earth with 5.6 billion women and 2.2 billion men.  The figures by this WhatsApp message and news report for total population and the ratio of men to women population is wrong.  A viral WhatsApp message claiming to be ‘breaking news’ claims the United Nations (UN) 2019 first quarter report shows there are 7.8 billion people on earth with 5.6 billion women and 2.2 billion men.  This message, which has the link to a news report attached to it,  advised women to be careful with their attitude towards men because out of the 2.2 billion men, one billion are married already, 130 million are in prison, and 70 million are mentally ill. “….There are 7.8Billion people on planet earth. The report shows:- Women = 5.6Billion, Men = 2.2Billion” part of this message read. We followed the link attached to this message, and it led to a news report by the Independent in April 2019. This report has the same details as the WhatsApp message claiming women are more than men in the world. A keyword search led to the UN’s population data from 1950 to 2020 and its report that noted the estimated world population for 2019 was 7.7 billion.  This  report believes the world’s population could grow to 8.5 billion in 2030 and 9.7 in 2050. “The world’s population reached 7.7 billion in mid- 2019, having added one billion people since 2007 and two billion since 1994”, part of the report read. This data shows that in 2019 the world population was 7.71 billion while in 2020 it was 7.79million. The data for male population  shows that in 2019, the Male population was 3.89 million while in 2020 it was 3.93 million.  The female population on the other hand was 3.82 million in 2019 and 3.86 million in 2020.  The UN world population prospect report for 2019 also shows this figure. This data is, however, confusing as the figures are in millions not billions unlike most reports about the world population. Totaling the figures over the years from 1950 to 2019 and 2020 using AutoSum on excel sheet did not help either.  So we needed an explanation of this dataset to better understand the figures so we looked at other other data sources. Statistic Times’ breakdown and explanation of the world population statistics by the UN show that in 2019, there were 3.89 billion men against 3.82 billion women, in 2020,  3.97 billion men against 3.86 billion women and in 2021, 3.97 billion men against 3.90 billion women.  “As of 2021, There are 3,970,238,390 or 3,970 million or 3.97 billion males in the world, representing 50.42% of the world population. The population of females in the world is estimated at 3,904,727,342 or 3,905 million or 3.905 billion, representing 49.58% of the world population. The world has 65,511,048 or 65.51 million more males than females” statistic times report read. Also, worldometers data showed that the world population for 2020 is approximately 7.79 billion while in 2019 it was 7.71billion.  From the above data sets, we can see that the figure, 7.8 billion given for the world population in 2019 is wrong as the actual figure is 7.7billion. Contrary to the WhatsApp claim that the female population is more than that of the male with 5.6 billion women against 2.2billion men, data show there are 3.89 men against 3.82 women.  The UN data and explanation by Statistic times show that the figures for total population and the ratio of men to women are wrong.  Aside from the incorrect figures, this is not a recent report and 2019 figures are no longer relevant seeing there are statistics for 2020 and 2021.  This makes the WhatsApp message and Independent news report false and misleading.  ",FALSE-,18/03/2022,https://dubawa.org/population-of-women-not-more-than-men-as-claimed-in-viral-whatsapp-message/
Claim: Obinna Nwosu in a tweet claims he is the first politician in the history of Abia State to be verified on Twitter.,"Obinna Nwosu, a London-trained freelance Finance and Oracle database consultant, was a governorship aspirant for Abia State 2023 election but his dream to become governor was short lived as he recently stepped down.  On Friday, February 18, 2022, Mr Nwosu (@obi_Nwosu), claimed he is the first Abia State politician to be verified on Twitter. He made this claim while sharing the screenshot of his notification page with a congratulatory message that his account had been verified.  “Guess who has just been verified by Twitter. This makes me the first Abia state politician in history to be verified on Twitter,” his tweet read. The blue check or blue verified badge on Twitter which shows that an account of public interest is authentic was introduced in 2009. To receive this badge, one’s account must be authentic, notable, and active. Categories recognised for verification include government, news organisations and individuals in news, companies, brands and organisations, entertainment, sports and gaming, activists and organisers, and content creators or other influential individuals. This badge is a big deal for many Nigerians, especially public figures.  This is a bold statement to make, seeing there are older politicians from Abia State who are more popular.. We, therefore, saw the need to verify this claim. Mr Nwosu, who joined Twitter in January 2017, was criticised for celebrating this win. A Twitter user, PrivateKing of Item (@jiswitu) pointed out that there is another verified Abia state politician named Mao Ohuabunwa.  We looked at Abia state politicians from 2009, when the blue badge came into existence, until now and accounts for those who are on Twitter. A look at the few who were on Twitter, like Enyinnaya Abaribe, the state governor, Okezie Ikpeazu, Orji Uzor kalu, Alex Otti, Uchechukwu Ogah and Ossy Prestige showed they are all not verified. We therefore checked out the senator’s Twitter page mentioned by the Twitter user in the comment section.  A visit to Mao Ohuabunwa’s (@SenOhuabunwa) Twitter page showed that his account, which was opened in June 2015, is verified. Mr Ohuabunwa represented Abia North Senatorial District in the 8th senate.  Having established that both Mr Nwosu and Mr Ohuabunwa were verified, we needed to know which account got the verified badge first. We reached out to Twitter support via email requesting their verification date. Twitter however replied, stating it does not monitor emails and advised we visit the help centre or submit a request via its online form.  However, Twitter’s  help centre and its online form did not help with this information as it does not have any search or enquiry topic that provides this detail.  We also tried tracing older tweets, especially verified ones to see if that will give away any clue but this did not help.  We then searched for Mr Ohabunwa’s Twitter page on Way Back Machine, an internet archive. One of the earliest captures is that of May 24, 2020. The archive shows that Mr Ohabunmwa tweeted about his birthday from a verified account. Even with this confirmation, it still isn’t clear when Mr Ohabunwa got the verification. We then reached out to the politician who directed enquiries to his aide, Uche Okoli. “We got this account verified in 2017 in the month of February,” Mr Okoli said in a phone interview with DUBAWA.  “We felt it was proper that as a serving senator at the time to have his Twitter account verified so that whatever information that comes from the handle would be deemed to be correct and be referenced.” Mr Okoli then provided a screenshot of the email from Twitter confirming Mr Ohabunwa’s verification status. DUBAWA confirmed the screenshot to be authentic. The screenshot shows that Mr Ohabunwa was verified on February 22, 2017, five years before Mr Nwosu’s verification in 2022 and just a month after he (Mr Nwosu) joined Twitter. Our findings show that Obinna Nwosu is not the first politician from Abia State to be verified on Twitter. We found another Abia State politician, Mao Ohabunwa, who was verified in 2017. Mr Nwosu’s claim is false. ",FALSE-,18/03/2022,https://dubawa.org/is-obinna-nwosu-first-abia-politician-to-be-verified-on-twitter/
"Claim: A Twitter user claims that the Pfizer vaccine has 1,291 side effects.","A Twitter user Deez (@Deezeytop) shared the link to a story that claims the Pfizer vaccine has 1,291 side effects. He made this claim while responding to a Tweet by DUBAWA that Nicki Minaj’s claim on COVID-19 vaccine side effects is false and misleading. Deez requested that the tweet by DUBAWA be removed as it was spreading misinformation claiming the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has confirmed these side effects.  “You’re spreading misinformation, please remove this tweet. It has been confirmed via the FDA” the Tweet read.  We looked at the story by The Rio Times attached to the Tweet and found the document that revealed the said side effects linked in the report.  Studying the document, we first observed that this document titled “cumulative analysis of post-authorization adverse reports of PF-07302048 (BNT162B2)” was a 2021 document. The document showed that there were a total of 42,086 case reports (25,379 medically confirmed and 16,707 non-medically confirmed) containing 158,893 events.  “Cumulatively, through 28 February 2021, there were a total of 42,086 case reports (25,379 medically confirmed and 16,707 non-medically confirmed) containing 158,893 events. Most cases (34,762) were received from United States (13,739), United Kingdom (13,404) Italy (2,578), Germany (1913), France (1506), Portugal (866) and Spain (756); the remaining 7,324 were distributed among 56 other countries.” The document also contained the list of Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI). This is found under Appendix 1, page 30-38 of the document. It includes events of interest due to their association with severe COVID-19 and events of interest for vaccines in general. This list which includes a wide range of conditions  is not the list of side effects of the Pfizer vaccine but the different possible effects  considered in its pharmacovigilance activities (the collection and assessment of safety related information to determine the benefit/risk impact). “The company’s AESI list takes into consideration the lists of AESIs from the following expert groups and regulatory authorities: Brighton Collaboration (SPEAC), ACCESS protocol, US CDC (preliminary list of AESI for VAERS surveillance), MHRA (unpublished guideline).  “The AESI terms are incorporated into a TME list and include events of interest due to their association with severe COVID-19 and events of interest for vaccines in general. The AESI list comprises MedDRA PTs, HLTs, HLGTs or MedDRA SMQs and can be changed as appropriate based on the evolving safety profile of the vaccine,”the document read.  From the document’s discussion, its data did not reveal any new safety concerns and the only safety concern identified is the risk of anaphylaxis (a severe and potentially life threatening allergic reaction).  “The data do not reveal any novel safety concerns or risks requiring label changes and support a favourable benefit risk profile of the BNT162b2 vaccine. Review of the available data for this cumulative PM experience, confirms a favourable benefit: risk balance for BNT162b2.” The document assures that Pfizer will continue routine pharmacovigilance activities on behalf of BioNTech according to the Pharmacovigilance agreement in place, in order to assure patient safety and will inform the Agency if an evaluation of the safety data yields significant new information for BNT162b2. Since the Twitter user claims this was confirmed by the FDA, we checked out FDA’s reports. We  found a report on Monday, January 03, 2022, which amended the emergency use authorization (EUA) for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine to expand its eligibility to include the use of a single booster dose in individuals 12 and older at least 5 months after primary vaccination. The FDA had given approval for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, for the prevention of COVID-19 in individuals 16 years of age and older in August, 2021.  The approval and subsequent update of its EUA shows the FDA still recommends the Pfizer vaccine as safe and effective.  We also looked at the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) published in March, 2022. The report shows two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine protect against COVID-19–associated emergency department and urgent care encounters among children and adolescents.  It, however, revealed that vaccine effectiveness (VE) was lower during Omicron predominance and decreased with time since vaccination.  The centre still advises that all eligible children and adolescents should remain up to date with recommended COVID-19 vaccinations, including a booster dose for those aged 12–17 years. The World Health Organisation report on the Pfizer vaccine, which was last updated January 2022, did not point to any 1,291 side effects. It only addressed anaphylaxis as the only cause to  discontinue the vaccine. A keyword search led to the same report by The Rio Times, The South African and other similar reports.  We also found a fact-check by TechArp which noted that the claim that the Pfizer vaccine has 1,291 side effects is based on  the list of adverse events of special interest on the document. So far the known side effects identified by the CDC, WHO, and the National Health Service (NHS), include; pain, redness or swelling in the arm where the shot was given and tiredness, headache, muscle pain, chills, fever, and nausea throughout the rest of your body. We also reached out to the FDA via email for more information, but were referred to  different online resources. Our findings, documents by relevant health organisations and details of the document linked to the Rio Times report does not show 1,291 side effects of the Pfizer vaccine. The only list contained in the document is that of Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI) Pfizer considered during its pharmacovigilance activities. This makes the claim false.

Claim: Some Facebook posts have a claim that Nigerian public universities are set to resume on 15th March.,"As conversations between the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) and Federal Government of Nigeria continue, a “breaking news” which has a claim that varsities are to resume on 15th March, has been circulating on social media. Aside the need to revitalise public universities, the 2009 agreement between the union and Nigerian government has been a major source of incessant industrial actions, disrupting the education of students in Nigerian public universities. In order to demand the fulfillment of this agreement, ASUU again embarked on its fresh three-week warning strike on 14th of February, 2022. Particularly on Facebook, DUBAWA’s finding reveals a ‘breaking news’  started circulating on Wednesday, 9th of March, 2022. Screenshots of similar posts have been repeatedly forwarded by WhatsApp users in different versions.  While stirring controversial comments, some Facebook users have questioned the source of this claim. Despite that, a large number of people believed it to be true. For example, Isma’il Abubakar demanded for the source of this claim from one of the posters.  “…Plz stop playing with our emotions 😏😏,” he added to his comment which never got any response. Another user accused a poster of confusing people. He further urged other users to wait for an official announcement. He said: “U guyx are saying what u don’t knowledge, this not good delete this post, u are confusing people, wait for the anouncement first. ”  Over time, DUBAWA has observed that during significant situations in the country, individuals and blogs don’t stop sharing information. Despite that many fail to name their sources, many continue to misinform the public. Going by such an event, has ASUU declared its resumption plan?  Information such as this usually makes it to the headlines of national dailies. But on the contrary, DUBAWA could not find any similar news in prominent Nigerian newspapers. News with such anticipated prominence with no actual appearance in any daily signifies a  red flag. Furthermore, after careful observations, DUBAWA discovered that the circulating information was written in the same format except with little changes, in a few cases. But while some of them were written with assertions that varsities are resuming, others used the expression “expected to resume” in their publications. But one thing was common with these different versions, their headlines carry the “breaking news” or “NEW” tag. Meanwhile, in a March 7th publication of Premium Times newspaper, ASUU still maintained its “no resumption until implementation of 2009 Agreement” stance. The union has already assured that it would continue the industrial action “until whatever the government wants to do with the agreement is completed and an acceptable implementation commences.”  This came from the leadership of the union after the minister of education, Adamu Adamu, gave a three-month deadline to the newly inaugurated committee members who are to renegotiate the ASUU-FG 2009 agreement. This further refutes ASUU’s resumption plan as claimed. ASUU has not announced its plan to resume on the 15th of March as claimed by social media users. Rather, the union still maintains its “no resumption until implementation of 2009 Agreement” position. ",FALSE-,13/03/2022,https://dubawa.org/asuu-did-not-ask-universities-to-resume-on-march-15/
"Claim: On its official Facebook page, the Nasarawa State Government, posted a picture of a ‘before and after’ construction of a road it claims to be in Sisinbaki-Kwarra, Wamba Local Government Council, Nasarawa State, Nigeria.","Social media has become an acceptable part of our daily lives. While there are ongoing debates about the efficacy of information that floods the platform, organisations and sectors continually use the social media space to promote their agenda and activities.  It is in light of this reality that the official Facebook page of Nasarawa State Government, shared a ‘before and after’ picture of a road it claims to be in Sisinbaki-Kwarra, Wamba Local Government Council, Nasarawa State Nigeria.  The Facebook page has over 13 000 followers and contains thousands of other pictures that convey the achievements of the state governor, Engineer Abdullahi Sule. The governor, who is an entrepreneur and businessman,  was elected in 2019 Governorship elections under the platform of the All Progressive Congress (APC).  The Facebook page captures his achievements since assuming office.  Comments on the page show that many depend on the page for authentic news about the state and take it as a reliable source. For instance, a user wrote this in praise of the page: “It brings to the people what the government is doing with(out) any distortion but as it is.” How true is this particular information from the page? The post, which presents the picture of the ‘before and after’ road construction, attracted over 200 reactions and over 70 re-shares. Even more, the same picture with apparently the same narrative featured on other Facebook users’ pages and also on Twitter.  For example, a user, Akashe Abdullahi Ari (@AkasheAri) on Twitter tweeted a picture of the road with the caption: “Before and after construction of 15.5km Sissinbaki-Kwarra Road in Wamba. Thank you, Governor Engr. Abdullahi A. Sule.”  However, not convincing enough for some users, they challenged the authenticity of the picture. “In Wamba Nah halfway to” Ibrahim commented. Also, another user, Joan, who doubted the picture challenged that “the picture of the road above is not in Nasarawa State. This is not true.”  Nasarawa State is a state in the North Central region of Nigeria, bordered to the east by the states of Taraba and Plateau, to the north by Kaduna State, to the south by the states of Kogi and Benue, and to the west by the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja. To verify the ‘before’ picture in the acclaimed narrative, a Yandex reverse image was conducted to trace the actual source of the acclaimed ‘before’ picture of the road.  The Yandex results show the picture was first used in 2015 in a report that details the construction of the Camaçari Metropolitan Road in Lauro de Freitas, Brazil.  A screenshot of the actual source of the acclaimed ‘Before’ image of the road on Jornal Grande Bahia  In fact, the Newspaper Grand Bahia, a leading publication in Brazil, reported on several levels of the road’s construction. Even more, the article credited the picture to Mateus Pereira of the Jornal Grande Bahia. The current Governor of Nasarawa State,   Engineer Abdullahi Sule, to whom the alleged road was referenced, came into office in 2019, while the ‘before’ image of the road has been in existence since 2015 as uncovered in the Jornal Grande Bahia.  Thus, the alleged image used to depict the ‘before’ conditions of the road in Sisinbaki-Kwarra, Wamba local government council, Nasarawa state Nigeria, is false.  When a google reverse image search of the alleged ‘after’ conditions of the road was conducted, results from multiple credible news sources show the image was truly that of the Sisinbaki-Kwarra, Wamba local government council, Nasarawa state Nigeria.  In a news story by Eggonnews, the governor was reported to commission the Sisinbaki-Kwarra road in Wamba local government council, Nasarawa State Nigeria, on May 22, 2021. In another report by Afridailynews, the governor was also reported to commission the same Sisinka-Kwarra road on the same day as that of the initial report, May 22, 2021.  Both reports featured the image of the road ‘after’ completion. Even more, one image shared on Afridailynews showed the governor beside a signpost with the details of the Sisinbaki/Kwarra road project.  Not entirely convinced, DUBAWA visited the location to further verify the claim. Findings at the location revealed that the purported ‘after’ picture of the road is actually true of the road project.  Community members who confirmed the claim admitted that the ‘before’ picture of the road is nowhere near their environment; however, they ascertained that the ‘after’ picture was genuine and even took DUBAWA to the actual location.  John Joel, a member of the Sisinbaki community who took DUBAWA around, said that the claim by the state government is indeed misleading.  “The ‘before’ picture is not from this part, this is not anywhere in Sisinbaki/Kwarra axis. I was here before and after and I can’t recall this location. But the ‘after’ is true, I even know the  location, and I can take you to the exact place.”  Similarly, Abdullahi Muhammad, a bike rider who acknowledged the same narrative offered to take this reporter to the location. DUBAWA’s findings uncovered that the Sisinbaki/Kwarra road project was actually constructed and even commissioned in 2021 by  Mr Sule. However, the picture shared to depict the ‘after and before’ condition of the road is misleading.  Further attempts made to contact the Facebook page for Nasarawa State government for comments proved unfruitful. Neither the messages sent on Facebook, nor the ones sent via email address provided on the page were replied to.   Likewise, calls and messages placed to two of the governor’s media aides were also not responded to as of the time this report was filed.  While DUBAWA has uncovered that the ‘before’ picture of the acclaimed completed Sisinka/Kwarra road in Wamba LGC, Nasarawa State is false and extracted from another location, the ‘after’ picture is truly that of the completed road project. The claim by the state government is misleading. This fact-check was produced by DUBAWA in partnership with Code for Africa’s PesaCheck, with support from ICFJ.

Claim: A movie poster making the rounds on social media depicts a Nollywood-produced movie on the Russia-Ukraine war.,"The Russia-Ukraine tension has attracted different versions of narratives. While some have been confirmed to be true, a number of others have been proven  to be false by DUBAWA.  Amid the stories arising from the conflict, the Nigerian film industry, Nollywood, has purportedly released a movie with the title–Russia Attacks Ukraine. The claim, which has been a source of memes on TikTok and a shocker on Facebook, has generated mixed reactions from social media users. While some viewers expressed their surprise, others, considering the sensitivity of the situation, have displayed their disappointment, saying it is unethical of Nollywood.  “This can’t be real ma people,” pon_maa2, a TikTok user, reacted. “I am officially unsubscribing from Nollywood!!! Once you gain some respect for the humane society, I may come back…,” Kineday Momoh’s comment reads in part. But could Nollywood actually have produced a movie to depict the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine? With a keyword search of the alleged title on Google, DUBAWA discovered two lengthy versions of the movies on YouTube, and in their titles Russia and Ukraine were mentioned. Both videos were uploaded eight days ago. The first one which already has 19k views was uploaded by NollywoodHeartTV with the title – “Russia Attacks Ukraine” while the second movie, uploaded by Nollywood Cinema, with the title – “HUNTED PRINCE Complete Part 1 & 2 – (New Movie) 2022 Latest Russian Tension,” has 16k views. DUBAWA viewed both movies but none of the storylines relate to the ongoing conflict  in Ukraine. Infact, on the advert poster of the first movie, “Russia Attacks Ukraine,” the country’s name was misspelled as “Ukarine,” an apparent red flag that signifies the unreliability of the claim. In the first movie, a young man named Osainoma stole the diamond of his gangster boss and escaped to an unknown place. The quest for his boss to repossess the treasure makes up the story. However, in the second movie, the wives of King Ezeugo’s son have been dying as soon as they move into the palace. Not knowing the cause, he decided to remarry. But during the celebration, the new bride suddenly fainted, causing turmoil in the palace. Apparently,  the movies have absolutely nothing to do with the war.  Their titles were simply click bait, a method used by online TV stations to lure users.  Noticeably, some Nigerian movies have been uploading movies on YouTube, using trendy captions in order to attract high views,  and in this case,   the enormous discourse around the war in Ukraine.  Although Nollywood recently released two movies referenced to Russia-Ukraine, their contents do not relate to the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. The titles used are merely bait  to attract more views. As such, this claim is false. Good one ",it,10/03/2022,https://dubawa.org/new-nollywood-movie-has-nothing-to-do-with-war-in-ukraine/
Claim: A WhatsApp message claims President Buhari said he won’t embark on foreign medical trips.,"As news about President Muhammadu Buhari’s proposed medical trip is making the rounds, a viral image which claims he promised not embark on foreign medical trips as president, has emerged. President Buhari’s office recently announced that he would “proceed to London for routine medical checks that would last for a maximum of two weeks,” after his three-day official visit to Kenya. The image, which has been shared repeatedly on WhatsApp, claims Mr. Buhari, a retired Army general, made the statement while delivering a lecture at The Royal Institute of International Affairs, Chatham House, on February 21st 2015, before he was elected Nigeria’s President. “What is the difference between me and those who elected us to represent them, absolutely nothing. Why should the Nigerian President not fly with other Nigerian public? Why do I need to embark on a foreign trip as a president with a huge crowd with public funds? Why do I need to go for foreign medical trip if we cannot make our hospital functional? Why do we need to send our children to school abroad if we cannot develop our university to compete with the foreign ones?” President Buhari allegedly said. The claim was also circulated on social media, particularly Facebook. President Buhari’s several foreign medical travels have often been criticised as “frivolous and unnecessary” by Nigerians.  DUBAWA confirmed that Muhammadu Buhari indeed delivered a lecture during the African Programme Meeting at Chatham House, London, on February 26, 2015. However, this is contrary to the viral image which claims the lecture held on February 21, 2015. Transcripts of Buhari’s lecture, “Prospects for Democratic Consolidation in Africa: Nigeria’s Transition”, obtained by DUBAWA, did not contain the statement credited to him in the viral image. Buhari’s only reference to a foreign hospital during the lecture came when he jokingly shared an instance when he heard rumours of his death in a London hospital. “Somebody announced me dead yesterday. I had a call from Maiduguri that somebody was listening to a friend crying saying Buhari had died in hospital in London. So he called me and I laughed my head off. So certainly I would be expecting too much if I don’t expect people are wishing me dead. I am very pleased I am fit. My doctors have declared me fit and I am going back for the final onslaught on PDP,” he said. DUBAWA found that this viral claim only resurfaced, having previously been circulated in 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021. There is also no record of any other event where Buhari delivered a speech at Chatham House on February 21, 2015. Presidential aide, Femi Adesina, who refuted the claims said it was not part of the text of the lecture at all. He described it as a “concoction by haters and agents of unity”, constructed  to diminish the reputation of President Muhammadu Buhari before millions of Nigerians who love him. The viral claim that President Muhammadu Buhari promised not to embark on foreign medical trips in his speech at Chatham House London in 2015, is false. Transcripts of his speech at Chatham House have no record of such a statement. ",trips,09/03/2022,https://dubawa.org/did-buhari-promise-not-to-embark-on-medical-trips-as-president/
Claim: Photos shared by a Twitter user shows nuclear weapons deployed by Russia against Ukraine to start World War 3.,"The ongoing crisis between Russia and Ukraine is unarguably the most trending issue in the world today, dominating news headlines and generating massive reactions from across the globe. As the crisis persists, people have continued to keep up with real time updates on the internet, especially on social media, where lots of misinformation and disinformation are proliferating to distort reality. One of such are photos shared by a Twitter user, @AdvoBarryRoux, showing nuclear weapons purportedly deployed by the Russian military in its ongoing campaign against Ukraine depicting the start of World War 3. The post was widely shared, generating 178 retweets, 19 quote tweets and 1,045 likes, at the time DUBAWA sighted it. Social media users are prone to believe information when it is from a source that they trust, and reactions from the comment section showed that a good number of the user’s 1.4 million followers took the information some weight. “These are weapons of mass destruction, and it’s definitely heading to a world war. We definitely don’t need that at all. Fuel prices will skyrocket. It will cause immense suffering everywhere,” one of his followers wrote. Another referring to a region in South Africa replied: “Apparently those have warheads of between 100 & 300 MT. What that means is 1 can turn Gauteng Province into a Desert.”  While the Russian-Ukraine crisis is ongoing in Eastern Europe, posts like this have the tendency of heightening tensions and spreading fear in other countries, like South Africa where the user and possibly a large chunk of his followers, are from. A Yandex reverse image search by DUBAWA revealed the origin of the two photos. One of the photos is from the Russian Victory Day held on June 24, 2020. In the photo are Russian RS-24 Yars ballistic missiles on display at the Red Square during the military parade to mark the 75th anniversary of the Nazi defeat in Moscow, Russia. The second photo was found to be from a 2015 Victory Day parade in Moscow. It has also been used several times to illustrate other reports like this 2015 BBC report. The photos, shared by a Twitter user to depict Russia’s deployment of nuclear weapons in the ongoing crisis with Ukraine as marking the start of World 3, is FALSE. The photos, as research have shown, are from Russia’s Victory Day Parades in 2015 and 2020, respectively.

"Claim: Facebook users claim that for the first time in the history of Sierra Leone, the powerful Air Force One in the United States of America landed at the Lungi International Airport in Sierra Leone under the leadership of President Bio.","Following a high level delegation of Congressmen and women of the House of Representative of the United States of America to Africa–Sierra Leone, Liberia, Cote d’ivoire and Tanzania, social media users in Sierra Leone shared claims of the arrival of the powerful Air Force One jet to Sierra Leone for the first time in the country’s history.  In a two-day visit, the delegation led by the Chairman of the US House  Foreign Affairs Committee Gregory Meek, whose ancestral lineage has been traced to Sierra Leone, spent time with the President and people of Sierra Leone. They also met  with the opposition party members and visited the historic Bunce Island in Sierra Leone which was a trading port during the slave trade era.  A screenshot from a Facebook user. Other notable members of the delegation were; Congress women Rep. Ilhan Omar, Rep. Joyce Beatty, Rep. Brenda Lawrence, and Congressmen Rep. Ami Bera,Rep. Troy A. Carter. Mr. Meek was ordained Paramount Chief in what was also described as his homecoming ceremony. The delegation arrived with the huge blue and white plane with the bold United States of America inscription on it. It was therefore presumed to be the Air Force One plane and was shared on various Facebook groups. The controversy over whether the aircraft was Airforce One has been growing since then. Central to this verification process by DUBAWA is establishing what makes the jet an Air Force One and to address the misconception that has clouded the plane for a long time. The comments section on the Facebook page, as seen below, depicts the mix-up that exists on the Air Force One aircraft. To start with, the Air Force One  jet is not a specific or single plane as many may believe. It is a couple of aircrafts  with specific tail numbers that have the function of transporting the president of the United States. It is the symbol of the US president.  What qualifies the flight to be called an Air Force One depends on whether the president is on board that flight.  Over a period of time, the two Boeing VC25A  aircrafts mostly referred to as the Air Force One  because they have both been transporting US presidents for decades. It is therefore accurate to say that any plane with the president on board can be designated with the Air Force One call sign .  Air Force One is a call sign that has a historical background. DUBAWA therefore made a false verdict on the claim of Air Force One landing in Sierra Leone on the basis that the president was not on board the plane apart from congressmen and women. Again, DUBAWA can say that the aircraft that landed at the Lungi International Airport was not of the calibre of the VC25As.  Even though the plane has the same looks as the Air force One’s famous blue and white and the US badge attached by the exit door, the tail number of the flight that brought in Congressman Meek and his delegation was not like the two jets that have   frequently been used by five different presidents of the United States since 1991. The plane that brought Mr. Meek and his delegation has a tail number different from the pair of Boeing 747s that have been mostly assigned the Air Force One call sign. The two Airforce One aircrafts come with tail numbers 28000 and 29000. From the screenshot, you can tell that the tail number of the plane that brought the delegation is not 28000 or 29000 that have played the role of Air Force One for three decades.  Screenshot of delegation on arrival at The Lungi International Airport. The idea of a call sign adopted to serve as an air traffic controller was motivated by the need to distinguish the plane carrying the US president from other commercial flights. This was further explained in this article  When President Dwight D. Eisenhower flew on a Lockheed VC-121A-LO Constellation in the early 1950s, the plane would eventually be referred to as Air Force One, being the first plane to use this call sign. This moniker was established following an  incident in 1953 when Eastern Air Lines 8610 crossed paths with Air Force 8610. The latter plane was carrying the incumbent president.  Military advisors taking into consideration the risk of having the president travel with a commercial flight during World War II proposed the idea of a military flight and one was immediately converted to serve that purpose for President Franklin Roosevelt and later President Truman.  Prior to the Boeing 747-200Bs,  there were several flights used as means of air transportation for the US presidents and these flights ranged from commercial to  customized aircraft for the head of state. The US Airforce on the quest to provide a befitting and secured means of transportation for the commander-in-chief proposed the idea of having a jet specifically designed to carry presidents of the United States. From Franklin D Roosevelt  who as the White House proclaimed was the first president to fly while in office to John F Kennedy who equally became the first US president to fly in a specially made presidential aircraft, these transitions were laying the foundation for what was going to be a symbol of America’s power and prestige- The Air Force One. Planes that predated the Boeing VC25As  ranged from the “Sacred Cow” initiated during Roosevelt’s tenure to “Independence” during Truman’s tenure to Eisenhower’s Columbines II and III. Whilst other political leaders like the Vice President can use either of the modified Boeing 747, it becomes Air Force Two when the Vice President of the United States is on board. A project on a new Air Force One is expected to be completed by 2024 to replace the aging VC25As. The two VC25A planes have played the roles of Air Force One  for three decades and are mostly assigned with the Air Force One call signs. They come with tail numbers 28000 and 290000. These two have been frequently used by  successive US presidents and mostly identified as Air Force One. However, any flight having the US President on board is automatically designated as  the Air Force One. In a nutshell, the Air Force One was neither in Sierra Leone nor  was the pair of modified Boeing planes that have served that purpose for three decades. Again, it is important to point out that Airforce One  is not one particular plane as many may believe.

"Claim: A Facebook post has a claim that an 8-year-old Ukrainian little girl confronted a Russian combatant, telling him to go back to his country.","Russia-Ukraine news stories have dominated major news platforms across the world since Russia invaded Ukraine. This, like most prominent topics, has made its way to  social media, where users have been sharing multiple reports that have garnered widespread attention. In the wake of the tension, different types of posts have been shared on social media. One of such posts was made on Facebook on Sunday by Atar News, a Facebook page with more than 12,000 followers.  The Facebook page claimed an 8-year-old Ukrainian little girl confronted a Russian combatant telling him to go back to his country.  The same claim was made on another Facebook page, Primeguard Media, attracting 228 shares and 84 comments since it was posted on Sunday. Several comments on the post indicate that some users believed the claim while others stated that this was not the case. Similarly, the post was shared on Nairaland, a popular Nigerian blog. Claims made during a crisis can exacerbate tensions and, in some cases, exaggerate the real situation. As a result of its virality and delicate nature, Dubawa chose to verify this claim. A Google Reverse Image Search of the image showed the image had appeared numerous times on the internet. Further checks revealed that Mirror shared a video of the supposed Ukrainian girl on its website in 2015. The video is of a fiery young Palestinian girl confronting a soldier and demanding to know where the Israeli Defense Forces have taken her brother. The video of the Palestinian girl identified as Ahed Tamimi was shared on YouTube in 2012, attracting 700,000 views. We observed that the image of the girl and the soldier is a screenshot from the video shared on the internet years back.  As reported by The Guardian, Ahed Tamimi, at 17 accepted a plea deal under which she served eight months in prison after reportedly slapping Israeli soldiers. She is, however, best known for a face off with an Israeli soldier asking “Where is my brother?” The pictures of the Palestinian girl have been used by different sources and for different reasons in different years. DUBAWA has established that the picture has nothing to do with the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. The alleged Ukrainian girl is a Palestinian while the alleged Russia soldier is an Isreali. While the Russian-Ukrainian tensions may have been a source of speculations, the image of the alleged Ukrainian girl and a soldier is not related to the Russian-Ukrainian tensions. More so, the alleged girl in the video has been identified to be Ahed Tamimi, a Palestinian resistance icon.

"Claim: A Twitter user claims that the cost for the ECOWAS 1,000 km Lagos-Abidjan highway is N167 billion.","The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) was established  on May 28, 1975, via the treaty of Lagos. The 15-member regional group  has a mandate to promote economic integration in all fields of activity of the constituting countries. It is courtesy of these goals that the ECOWAS set out  to begin an action plan on the construction of the 1,028kilometers Lagos-Abidjan road. The road will connect Lagos, Cotonou, Lome, Accra, and Abidjan.  The road project is now a point of a Twitter controversy. One user,  Damzy (@Segun_Odunayo)claims that ECOWAS is constructing  the  1,000 km Lagos/Abidjan road for N167 billion. The tweet was received with mixed signals; while  some users argued that the information was incorrect,  others simply consented to the statement.  “Is there a standard template for determining the costs of these roads? Though  it could be more expensive when you compare it with that Lagos-Abidjan road. Perhaps there are complexities that make it so expensive. Just giving the benefit of doubt,” Babatope Falade (@FaladeBabatope) questioned.  The claimant brought into his narrative the  N9.9 billion 35km Oyo-Iseyin road, suggesting that the cost is outrageous compared to ECOWAS’ N167 billion road project. No doubt,  the cost of infrastructural projects has always been a point of controversy. In recent years, both public office holders and citizens have made claims around topics that have turned out to be misleading, thus putting public trust in doubt and arousing more questions than usual.  When Dubawa conducted a search on the actual amount of money that was set aside for the ECOWAS Lagos-Abidjan 1, 000km highway, the results show multiple credible media outlets had reported that the highway was set to cost $2billion.  A report by Road Traffic Technology stated that ‘the highway is expected to cost around $2bn. It will connect Cote d’Ivoire’s commercial capital, Abidjan, to Lagos in Nigeria.’   The same report was also published in the Nation Newspaper, with the headline: “Lagos-Abidjan highway to cost $2bn.”  Also, there is a detailed report on ECOWAS website that provides all the necessary information regarding the Lagos-Abidjan highway, including the partners in the project.  To establish a base for the claim, DUBAWA reached out to the claimant, Segun Odunayo, via a phone call.  Mr Odunayo explained he had received the  intel from a source he considers credible but cannot declare openly.  He added that the N167 billion he mentioned was an additional fund ECOWAS was seeking to complete the project.  “A lot of people who saw the tweet misunderstood me,” he said. “The information I tweeted was the intel I got from my source, and I trust his findings.” Mr Odunayo however failed to give this clarification in his tweet. But did ECOWAS ever seek for more funds aside the $2 billion?  DUBAWA uncovered that The Cable has once published a news report on how the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) was seeking additional funds for constructing the $2 billion Lagos-Abidjan highway project. The lead in the  report details that “the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) is seeking additional funds for constructing the $2 billion Lagos-Abidjan highway project.” It further explains how ECOWAS and the African Development Bank (AfDB) signed a $22.7 million (N9,152 billion)  loan agreement as an additional funding to “make up” for $2billion for the project (not more funds aside the $2billion).  This $22.7 billion dollar contract between the AfDB and ECOWAS was only  a fraction of the $2billion not an addition to it. ECOWAS had a funding gap and needed additional funds to make up for $2billion. Thus, the extra funds needed by ECOWAS was not an additional to the total sum of $2billion but a make up of it.  DUBAWA  also reached out to ECOWAS for further comments about the actual amount of the highway project and if it has sought more funds  amounting to N167 billion aside the initial $2billion. All attempts via phone calls and emails were not replied  as at the time this copy was published.  Notably, the naira-dollar exchange rates for April 2013, (the official year and month that the Lagos-Abidjan  was launched by ECOWAS) indicated that the $2 billion was still equivalent to N312 billion not N167 billion. DUBAWA’S findings contradicts the claimant’s assertion; the total funds  for the highway was costed at $2billion (N831 billion) not $167 billion. Even in 2013, when the project was first announced, the N312 billion was the naira equivalent of $2billion not 167 billion. Hence, this claim is false.

Claim: A user on Facebook claims China has implanted chicken organs in pigs to make them produce chicken eggs.,"Claim: A user on Facebook claims China has implanted chicken organs in pigs to make them produce chicken eggs.  The image used to support the claim was extracted from a different context and doctored to suit the bogus narrative. This claim is false.  When a user on Facebook, Uchenna Dike,  shared an image of what he claimed to be pigs laying eggs, alongside the heading:  “China plants chicken organs in pigs for faster and more eggs production,” the comment section of the post became hilarious.  “Making us to realise; or to understand that some scientific knowledge is purely satanic, i.e. please add chicken-pig egg to my rice,” one user, Cyprian Ajunwo, commented.  However, some doubts raised by other users stirred some questions. “Mammal animals can never lay eggs… I still remember that one very well. It is impossible,” Asiwaju Olajide Toby, contested.  Not entirely surprising, the post garnered over 5000 re-shares and close to over 2000 reactions within just two days of its appearance. Notably, the claimant and the commenters could not point to the actual source of the narrative, as most of the users apparently seem to believe it.  The same narrative made headlines on a Ghana-based news website, Vimbuzz: “China plants chicken organs in other animals for faster egg production,” featuring the same image as the one shared on Facebook.  But still, what is the probability of such a great invention taking place?  No doubt, great scientific and technological inventions have been referenced to the Chinese and in the past also, the world has witnessed great revolutions in different areas, yet,  the claim that pigs are genetically modified to lay eggs seems to be a question that requires more answers than the one that already meets the eyes.  When a Yandex reverse image search was conducted on the alleged image, the results showed the image was taken out of context and manipulated to cast a new and bogus narrative around it.  Originally, the alleged image appeared on a Ukrainian agricultural promotion website. The image was used, along with a post that was promoting ‘common’ individuals to venture into cattle ranching. Apparently noticeable is that even the alleged pigs, as initially claimed in the image, were actually a group of ranch cows.   This is not the first time the image was used to spread false claims. In 2018, a Ukrainian-based news site, Top news debunked a claim that used the image of the cows to allege that cancer was implanted in cows to boost their growth.   “Pigs or mammals can not lay eggs. The possibility is just not feasible,” Dr Jeremiah Milon, chief veterinarian at Animal first, said.  Also, according to Scientific American, “Only two kinds of egg-laying mammals are left on the planet today—the duck-billed platypus and the echidna, or spiny anteater. These odd “monotremes” once dominated Australia, until their pouch-bearing cousins, the marsupials, invaded the land over 71 million to 54 million years ago and swept them away. New research suggests these two kinds of creatures managed to survive because their ancestors took to the water.” Pigs can not lay eggs and mammals in general cannot. DUBAWA has uncovered that the image used to spread the alleged narrative was doctored. This claim is false.  This fact-check was produced by DUBAWA in partnership with Code for Africa’s PesaCheck, with support from ICFJ.  those arent pigs ",false,04/03/2022,https://dubawa.org/image-doctored-to-claim-pigs-lay-eggs-in-china/
"Claim: Tope Fasua, a Facebook user, shared a video of what appears to be Ramon Olorunwa Abbas, popularly known as Hushpuppi, lamenting over his experience behind bars, after he was arraigned by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for online financial fraud.","Ramon Olorunwa Abbas is a popular personality in Nigeria.  Last year, his name took over the headlines  after he was arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for charges relating to online financial fraud, what is popularly referred to as “yahoo-yahoo” in Nigeria.  Over months that followed the arrest, Hushpuppi has triggered multiple discourses and has also been a point of controversy. Recently, a Facebook user shared a video of what appears to be Hushpuppi   lamenting behind bars and sharing his experiences in the hands of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).  The alleged video depicted Hushpuppi chattering about the amount of money found in his apartment and also claiming to still be in possession of $250 million that is kept in his apartment “untouched.” He was also depicted to express his regret “snapping and spending money” with politicians that have now abandoned and deserted him. In the comments section of the post, one user commented, “Guy man, just calm down and do your time jejely.” Another commenter said, “FBI don chop you. Just cool down, do your time in 20 years and you will see the green grass of home.” Majority of the comments seem to resonate with Hushpuppi’s situation, signalling a sense of consent to the video’s originality. Even more, the video has been seen by over 4,000  users, calling for verification of the claim. To verify the originality of the alleged video, DUBAWA conducted  a search on Google to find any related report to the alleged video, but none was found. However, the video was traced to a comedy YouTube channel, @akposthecomedian where it was identified as having been originally shared a year ago. In the video, the facial attributes of Hushpuppi are marred by obvious adulteration. This is evident in the words uttered by the supposed Hushpuppi. The sound of his voice clearly does not conform with the movement of the lips. Also, the eyes of the supposed Hushpuppi also signalled another red flag. As his speech gets emotional, his pupils have no human presence. His eyelashes jolted inconsistently throughout the video. Our general assessment of his facial features shows that the supposed Hushpuppi was a deepfake. This is also evident in the lips of the supposed Hushpuppi, exhibiting different colours as he lamented. These findings led DUBAWA to conduct an analysis of the alleged video on Deepware (an online tool that identifies deep fakes). The results showed that it was  a deep fake; in fact, both versions of the video from Facebook, and  the original source were both found to be deepfakes. The alleged video has been in existence on social media since 2020 and was only reshared by a Facebook user to revive the narrative. The video is also doctored as revealed by Deepware and was deliberately created by a Youtuber to generate clicks from viewers. Hence, this claim is fake.

Claim: A user on Twitter claims that three Nigerian men were arrested in Dubai whilst faking to be Arab women.,"It is common among young Nigerians to seek greener pastures in advanced countries of the world. Interestingly, the concept is referred to as ‘japa’ by Nigerians.  While immigration in itself is not a bad aspiration, the illegal means some Nigerians used to depart to other nations seem to have brought a bad name to the country.  As such, narratives around Nigerians illegally trying to migrate to other countries always seem to attract attention and assumptions.  A typical example is a tweet that claims ‘three Nigerian men were arrested in DUBAI for faking to be Arab women.’ The post was made by Alaya Kamal (@iam_skamal) and soon attracted over 1,000 reactions, alongside multiple comments from bewildered, doubting and believing users. One user, Dreal Kwaba (@chineduIH), commented thus: “Lmaoooooooo My country men no dey ever fail. Constituting a nuisance everywhere.” However, FOUNDATIONAL HUMAN BEING (@TosinFayanju), also another user, challenged the claim. The user wrote: “People won’t verify this and just be spreading it. Just as someone was spreading fake news Abt a Cameroon player. Calling his wife, his daughter.” While, do_U_mind? (@PkHoody) perceived the tweet as an incredibly hilarious thing Nigerians can actually do.  “Nigeria should have a movie production company filming everyday citizens in the country. The whole country people are some way bi🤣🤣🤣” It didn’t stop there. The claim also made it to the mainstream media, spreading the same narrative with more details attached to it. On hettysmedia, a report published on the claim, alongside the same picture, details that: “Three Nigerian men dressed like Arab women have been arrested in Dubai by the Emirate security operatives.” The Rifnote news and the Gulftoday news websites also featured this same narrative. Apparently, the claim has made appearances on different platforms but with the same narrative of Nigerians. While it is easy to dismiss this claim as truthful, the reputation and image of nations have been soiled in the past for such allegations that have often been unconfirmable.   First, DUBAWA conducted a Yandex reverse image search to trace where the supporting picture of the alleged three men first appeared.  The results trace the image to a  video on a YouTube channel titled   “El Bilad TV” Apparently, the TV  reported on  a network of local and foreign nationals of drug and human traffickers that were arrested by Algerian police in Algeria and not Dubai.  Further details in the video did not mention if the men were Nigerians, but  noted that they were arrested for smuggling drugs and other illegal substances while dressed up as women to evade law officials.  Apparently, the event was popular news in Algeria. TSA Algerie, a prominent media outlet in Algeria, reported that: “a group of traffickers of hard drugs was apprehended by the judicial police services of the wilaya of Algiers, announced Thursday, February 3, the DGSN in a press release.” The report also outlines the seizure of 1.5 kg of hard drugs, including 780 grams of heroin, 670 grams of cocaine and 80 grams of cannabis by the police from the men.  Regarding the men’s nationality, the news report reveals that:  “This large-scale operation also made it possible to put an end to human trafficking in which this network made up of 14 people, including 4 Algerians and the 10 others of a foreign nationality, aged between 20 and 24, was engaged, according to the judicial police officer.” Even more, findings show that the Algerian police have made a post on Facebook regarding the claim but with no mention of the actual nationality of the men, only describing them as a  criminal network specialised in illegal trafficking of solid drugs.  Findings show these men were arrested in Algeria by the Algerian police and not Dubai. Also, no fact points to the reality that these men were Nigerians or  have anything to do with Nigeria. As such, this claim is misleading.  ",MISLEADING,02/03/2022,https://dubawa.org/how-true-is-claim-dubai-police-arrested-3-nigerian-men-disguising-as-women/
Claim: A viral video on WhatsApp showcases shells of missiles alleged to have been released by Russia into Ukraine.,"The Russia-Ukraine tension has arguably been on top of the news chat lately. Yesterday, several news reports  said Russia had invaded Ukraine. While the news was still fresh,  several narratives with different versions made the rounds.  One claim making the rounds on WhatsApp  showcased an alleged shelling of Russian missiles into Ukraine.  The footage, which is apparently taken at night, depicts several missile shelling at night time like the splash of fireworks on a new year’s day.  Although there is  no obvious statement attached to the video, multiple users who came across it seem to acknowledge the  footage as that of the Russian missiles released on Ukraine over the night.  On a certain WhatsApp group where the video was shared, most members who commented on it panicked, while others called on the Nigerian Government to extract its citizens from Ukraine.  “Jesus, I can’t believe my eyes. God, please have mercy on us.” One user expressed.  “Buhari should please return our brothers and sisters over there. Russia is ready to destroy Ukraine,” one user added.  In the past, DUBAWA has debunked several claims around conflicts that  use  multimedia content to paint a usually misleading narrative.  When DUBAWA subjected the video to a frame by frame analysis  of the InVid verification tool, the results show that the frames of the video have been used several times in different reports about the Israeli-Palestinian crises that took place in May 2021.   The Israeli–Palestinian conflict commenced on 10 May 2021, and continued until 21 May 2021. The conflict reported rocket attacks on Israel by Hamas, and Israeli airstrikes targeting the Gaza Strip. It is clips from these crises that are now used to depict the Ukrainian/Russian conflict. In a report by Portal Islam in May 2021, a frame from the alleged video was used to account for Hamas’ attack on Israel. “Hamas rockets hit Tel Aviv’s heart,  flying far from Haifa to Nazareth,” the headline stated.  Further details of the video show it was a combination of five different clips taken from the Israeli-Palestinian conflicts of May 2021.  In fact, parts of the acclaimed video have also appeared on a Twitter post that was shared by Fahmidah Yousfi (@fahmidahyousfi) back in May 2021. The user posted the video  with the statement:  “Hamas and Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine just issued a new warning to Israel: “Destroy any more residential towers in Gaza and we will destroy TelAviv. And Hamas fired 130 rockets at Tel Aviv🔥🔥🔥.” While tensions have continued to escalate between Russia and Ukraine, no credible news media has shared this footage or something similar to depict the Russian attacks on Ukraine.  Though reports show Russia has made attempts to attack Ukraine, the alleged video dates back to the Palestinian/Israeli conflict of May, 2021. This claim is false.

Claim: A user on Twitter claims the picture of  a  burning inflight  jet was that of the 6th Russian aircraft downed by Ukraine.,"Lately, the  Russian/ Ukrainian tensions have been the major news headlines across the world. Like most prominent topics, this also has made its way to the  social media sphere and users have been sharing multiple reports that have attracted mass attention.  A typical example of such a narrative is a tweet made by Illia Ponomarenko (@AIPonomarenko) where he  reportedly shared a picture of an inflight burning jet as the 6th Russian aircraft downed by Ukraine.’ The post attracted over 12,000 reactions, and was retweeted over 3,000 times since its appearance online. Multiple comments   shared on the post suggest most users believed the claim. However, others argued that it was not true.  Claims made during crises can escalate tensions and sometimes even heighten the reality of the situation. As such, Dubawa opts to confirm this claim.  A Yandex reverse image search showed the image was featured  in a 2014 news report by Khoiro Ummah news. The report details how ‘Al-Qassam successfully Shoots Israeli F-16 Fighter Plane,’ using the image to support the context.  Similarly, the Islamic Republic News Agency in 2018 featured the same picture in a news report, with the headline: ‘Syria shoots down Israel’s jet fighter.’ Again, the Mehr News Agency also used the same picture in a news report that dates back to 2018.  Like the other two websites, this one also had a different headline that says: ‘Saudi jet fighter downed by Yemenis.’ Apparently, the alleged picture of the burning in-flight jet seems to have been used by different sources and for different reasons for some years. Nonetheless, while its true source could not be ascertained, it can be confirmed that the image has long existed before the start of the recent Russian/Ukrainian tensions.  While the Russian/Ukrainian tensions might have been a source of diverse speculations, the picture of the alleged inflight burning aircraft is not from the Russian/Ukrainian frictions.

Claim: Screenshot of a ‘breaking news’ headline has claimed that President Buhari is set to intervene if Russia refuses to back down on Ukraine.,"Claim: Screenshot of a ‘breaking news’ headline has claimed that President Buhari is set to intervene if Russia refuses to back down on Ukraine.  The framed screenshot with the claim that President Buhari would intervene if Russia refuses to back down on Ukraine is fake. The screenshot was created using an online tool called breakyourownnews. This claim is false.  The Russian /Ukrainian tension is now a  popular discourse amongst Nigerians. Recently, a screenshot of breaking news has a claim that President Muhammadu Buhari of Nigeria is set to intervene if Russia refuses to step down from her assault on Ukraine.  The screenshot of breaking news which contains the picture of President Buhari has been making the rounds on social media platforms. Even more, some users who had come across the screenshot seem to believe that Nigeria is already taking a side on the matter. One user, who forwarded the picture on a WhatsApp group, wrote: “I am glad that Nigeria is supporting Ukraine, at least Buhari is taking a favorable stance here.”  Others who saw the image also shared similar comments, with little or no iota of doubt about the originality of the screenshot.  This is not the first time DUBAWA has debunked a similar screenshot that shares unconfirmed narratives.  As convincing as the claim appears to be, DUBAWA uncovers that no media outlet published or reported on the matter.  Other findings show the screenshot was created with an online tool called ‘break your own news.’ The tool allows users to create all sorts of news headlines and captions,  alongside any kind of supporting image they deem fit.  There is a disclaimer on the website that says: “This app is intended for fun, humour and parody – be careful what you make and how it may be shared. You should avoid making things which are unlawful, defamatory or likely to cause distress. Have fun and be kind!”  The case,  however, appears to be the opposite of this disclaimer, as users are now using it to fabricate unfounded headlines that are  misleading the unsuspecting members of the public.  When DUBAWA forged a headline on the tool, the result was exactly as the alleged screenshot.  A typical screenshot created by DUBAWA on the tool Disclaimer: this screenshot was only created by DUBAWA for the purpose of this investigation. Readers should neither take it seriously nor try to create other versions.  President Buhari is yet to make a statement as regards the ongoing tensions between Russia and Ukraine. The alleged screenshot was merely used to share a simulated narrative. This claim is false.

Claim: A Twitter user claims HIV now has a cure after using a novel stem cell transplant approach.,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is an infection that attacks the white blood cells called CD4 cells. As at 2020, there were an estimated 37.7 million people living with HIV and the virus continues to be a major global public health issue, having claimed 36.3 million lives so far.  A Twitter post by Pride (@masi_nonxuba) claims HIV cure has been found as three patients were cured of it. The cure, the post claims, used a novel stem cell transplant approach.  ‘HIV cure has been found. After using a novel stem cell transplant approach, three patients have now been declared HIV free’ the post read. The search for a cure for HIV has been in the works for a long time, thereby making this claim vital to verify.  A look at this post made on Thursday, February 17, 2022, showed the post has gained a lot of attention. As of⁸ Monday, February 21, 2022, the post had generated 63,000 retweets, 6,166 quote retweets and 395,000 likes.  Despite this much traction, there were varying comments under this post. A Twitter user, Mr Closet (@Reeuq11) commented that a potential curative treatment was found, not a cure.  Another comment cautioned the poster on his use of words noting this is not a viable cure for everyone. Another Twitter user commented requesting a link to an article about this claim.  The Poster responded with a link for news24.com which carried a report by Reuters with the headline ‘first woman reported cured of HIV after bone marrow transplant’.  According to this report, published on February 16, 2022, this case is part of a larger US-backed study led by Dr Yvonne Bryson of the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA), and Dr Deborah Persaud of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. A keyword search showed this story had been widely reported by BBC, New York Times,  Voice of America (VOA), Reuters, Aljazeera etc.    A study of these reports showed that a 64-year-old woman who was being treated for leukaemia was reported cured of HIV. This came after receiving a stem cell transplant for her leukaemia. The woman has now been free of the virus for 14 months. This woman is said to be the third patient cured of HIV and the first woman. The first two patients were male (Timothy Ray Brown and Adam Castillejo). Timothy Ray Brown, a Berlin patient who was the first person reported to be cured of the virus, was given a bone marrow transplant to cure his acute myeloid leukaemia in 2007. His donor had a rare mutation in part of their deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) called the CCR5 gene which makes the donor naturally resistant to HIV.  In 2020, Castillejo, a London patient was revealed to be the second person cured of HIV also through a stem-cell transplant for his cancer. The transplant method used here, involving umbilical cord blood, has been said to be too risky and not suitable for most people with HIV. From the report of the first patient of HIV cured, we saw that the stem-cell received was from a donor who had a DNA resistant to HIV called the  C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) gene. What exactly does this mean?  In 1996, researchers discovered that CCR5 encodes a receptor on CD4+ cells that HIV uses to enter the cells early on during an infection and people who have two copies of the so-called Δ32 allele don’t produce this receptor, and therefore seem to be protected against the virus. Naturally occurring CCR5-specific antibodies have been found in exposed but uninfected people, and in a subset of HIV seropositive people who show long-term control of the infection. The identification of naturally occurring CCR5 mutations makes the CCR5 molecule a promising target to prevent or limit HIV infection in vivo.  This study on cured patients notes the critical role CCR5 plays in maintaining HIV-1 infection. The World Health Organisation (WHO) noted there is no cure for HIV but the disease can be managed by treatment regimens composed of a combination of three or more antiretroviral (ARV) drugs. ‘Current antiretroviral therapy (ART) does not cure HIV infection but effectively   suppresses viral replication within a person’s body and allows an individual’s immune system recovery to strengthen and regain the capacity to fight off opportunistic infections and some cancers’ part of the WHO document read. Since 2016, the WHO recommended that all people living with HIV be provided with lifelong ART. This  includes children, adolescents, adults and pregnant and breastfeeding women, regardless of clinical status or CD4 cell count.  This recommendation, as at June 2021, has been adopted by 187 countries covering 99% of all people living with HIV globally. Although the search for a cure for HIV has been in the works, there is so far no proven cure for the virus. The stem-cell transplant method the Twitter user mentioned is not new as it had been used for a patient as far back as 2007. The three patients who have received this stem-cell transplant were suffering from cancer and needed it to save their lives. While this therapy reportedly cured them of HIV, curing their HIV was not  the primary goal and the therapy is too risky for everybody with HIV. Also, our research and data by the WHO on HIV shows there is so far no cure for HIV and the CCR5 gene is only a promising prospect. This makes the claim false and misleading.

Claim: A twitter user claims that the PDP won all chairmanship and councillor seats at the 2022 FCT polls.,"On February 13, 2022, a twitter user @Ahmed_Jimeta1 claimed that the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) had clinched all the chairmanship and councilorship seats at the just-concluded 2022 Federal Capital Territory (FCT) elections. “PDP wins all chairmanship & councilorship seats in the council polls conducted by INEC Yesterday in FCT Abuja,” he posted. Mr Jimeta’s post was widely shared, generating 165 Retweets, 25  Quote Tweets and 615 Likes. The elections were conducted on February 12, 2022 by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) into the six FCT area councils: Abaji, Abuja Municipal (AMAC), Bwari, Gwagwalada, Kuje and Kwali, and for 62 council seats in wards across the FCT. A total of 14 political parties participated in the election., but two of them – All Progressives Congress (APC) and People’s Democratic Party (PDP), dominated the polls. Reports of the official results released by the electoral umpire, INEC, indicates a contrary position to the claims of the twitter user. INEC figures show that the PDP won the chairmanship seat in three area councils (Kuje, Bwari and Abuja Municipal), while the All Progressives Congress (APC) clinched Gwagwalada, Kwali and Abaji. In Kuje, the PDP’s Suleiman Sabo polled 13,301 votes to defeat Sarki Hamidu of the All Progressive Congress (APC), who secured 7,694 votes.  The PDP’s candidate, John Gabaya was re-elected for a second term in Bwari after scoring 13,045 votes ahead of the APC’s Audi Shekwolo who had 7,697 votes.  Christopher Zakka of the PDP was declared the winner of the chairmanship seat in Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC), having polled almost 20,000 votes to beat his closest rival, Murtala Karshi of the APC. After the elections in Gwagwalada, Abubakar Jubrin of the APC was declared winner by INEC after scoring 11,125 votes against the 9,579 votes obtained by the PDP’s Kassim Mohammed. In Abaji,  the APC scored 7,280 votes to defeat Yahaya Garba of the PDP, who polled 4,063 votes. INEC declared APC winner, but failed to announce any particular candidate due to an ongoing legal tussle between two of the party’s candidates, Muhammad Loko and Umar Abdullahi. Elections in Kwali Area Council ended with the declaration of APC candidate, Danladi Chiya, as winner and chairman-elect of the council. Mr Chiya obtained 7,646 votes against the 7,345 votes of his closest rival, Haruna Pai of the PDP. The PDP did not also clinch all the council seats in the election, as official results have shown. While the PDP clinched all the councillor seats in Kuje, in Gwagwalada, the party picked six council seats against the four won by the APC. In Abuja Municipal (AMAC), the PDP won 10 seats, while the APC won just two. Contrary to the claim by Mr Jimeta in his twitter post that the PDP won all seats for chairman and councillor in the 2022 FCT elections, official results released by INEC showed that the PDP and APC shared the seats. For the chairmanship seats, the PDP won in three area councils, with the APC clinching the remaining three councils, just as candidates of both parties won councillor seats across the six area councils.

Claim: A Twitter user claims NIRSAL cannot trace those who took loans from it.,"Due to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) introduced a N50 billion Targeted Credit Facility as a stimulus package to support households, micro, small and medium enterprises.  The CBN shared the stimulus package for whosoever showed interest and by implication applied at Nigeria Incentive-Based Risk Sharing System for Agricultural Lending (NIRSAL) MicroFinance Bank (MFB). Recently, NIRSAL called for the payment of the loan.  Following this, a Twitter user Olayemi (@olayemi_123), on Saturday, February 5, 2022, attributed a claim to NIRSAL saying that it cannot trace those they gave loans to. ‘We cannot trace those we gave loans, the contacts they use are non-existent’ the statement was attributed to NIRSAL. This claim is absurd and not the kind of statement expected of a reputable organization so we decided to verify.  A keyword search on NIRSAL loans led to a number of news reports and Twitter posts. In an interview with Vanguard in December, 2021, the Managing Director of the NIRSAL MFB, Abubakar Kure, said that ‘nobody can run away with the company’s money’. He stated that a ‘water-tight’ mechanism has been put in place to ensure full repayment of each loan. Our search also led to a Twitter post by NIRSAL Plc stating nirsal.com does not give out loans but NIRSAL MFB does. This Tweet, which was in reaction to several posts calling out NIRSAL Plc, is suggesting that NIRSAL Plc is different from NIRSAL MFB. So we looked into both names. Our findings show there are two different websites bearing the name NIRSAL. One is nirsal.com and the other nmfb.com.ng. According to nirsal.com, NIRSAL Plc is a ‘US$500million Non-Bank Financial Institution wholly-owned by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) created to Redefine, Dimension, Measure, Re-Price and Share agribusiness-related credit risks in Nigeria’. It was established in collaboration with the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (FMARD) and Nigerian Bankers’ Committee in 2013. NIRSAL MFB (nirsal.com.ng), on the other hand is ‘a leading Nigerian financial institution licensed by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) in Nigeria’. The Company was incorporated as a Private Limited Company in 2019 and commenced operations following the grant of a license by the CBN to operate as a National Microfinance Bank. The Bankers Committee owns 50%, NIRSAL 40% and NIPOST 10%. We also reached out to the NIRSAL MFB via phone calls and spoke to two customer representatives who noted that the viral claim is false.  ‘The information is incorrect because all our beneficiaries have a Bank Verification Number (BVN) and their BVN is what we use to know who is owing’, one of the customer representatives explained. The customer representative noted that it is not possible that they won’t be able to trace those they gave loans to. We have also reached out to NIRSAL Microfinance Bank via their social media pages but there is no reply to further verify this claim as at press time. There is no official link to verify the originality of the claim attributed to NIRSAL on social media. Sources from NIRSAL MicroFinance Bank also said it did not emanate from them. Hence, the claim is false.  ",FALSE-,21/02/2022,https://dubawa.org/how-true-is-it-that-nirsal-cannot-trace-its-loan-beneficiaries/

On facebook, the claim was shared by multiple users with the simple but catchy headlines: “FG sets to increase NYSC allowance to 45k. Dear corp members, you can save more than extra cash this time around.” On Twitter, the claim opened a space for debate among social media users. Users on the platform seem to welcome the idea of increase of allowance and even shared it.    Although the federal government truly increased the allowance from N18,900 to N33,000  in 2020, none of these users sharing this new increase identified their sources. Despite the absence of proof, comments from users clearly show that they actually believed this to be true. An example is from a Facebook blogger, “Kennyblogger,” whose post has generated 1,000 likes, 236 comments, and 20 shares.  A user, Makuo Nwakozor,  who is presumably a current  Youth Corper commented thus: “Now my NYSC  allowance is about to end. That is when they remember to increase it to 45 000 Abeg thunder where you dey?” Akwe Francis Omaku, another user who also appears to consent to the narrative said: “And they should please start it this February abeg…I don broke even as the never paid February allawe.” Apparently, most users believed and tagged the said increase as a strategy towards the upcoming presidential election.  In a bid to reconstruct, reconcile and rebuild the country after the Nigerian Civil war, the NYSC scheme was established in 1973 by the Nigerian government.  According to a report by Premium Times newspaper, the NYSC monthly allowance was raised from ₦9,775 to ₦19,800 in 2011. However, due to the new National Minimum Wage, it was increased to ₦33,000 in 2020. Recently, Dubawa debunked a WhatsApp claim that the NYSC has put payment of the January 2022 allowance for corps members on hold until further notice.”   One common feature Dubawa noticed in the trend of the claim (both on Facebook and Twitter) was the absence of the information’s source. Apparently, none of the claimants provided any information about the source of the information. It simply appeared as a tweet or a Facebook post. In fact, when DUBAWA questioned one of the claimants  over the source of the information, the user, Precious Umezinwa remained vague and said: “it’s true but they haven’t implemented it.” However, unlike this user, others ignored similar questions over the credibility of the claim. Seemingly, the inability of these users to name their sources suggests that they also “shared as  received,” which often, is a cause of misinformation. Usually, an increase in pay makes the headlines. However,  when  Dubawa made an inquiry, results showed that no newspaper reported it. This is one major red flag. Further, Dubawa contacted NYSC Deputy Director, Press and Public Relations, Emeka Rems Mgbemena over the efficacy of the claim.  Briefly but sternly, Mr. Emeka discredited the claim. “My brother, it’s not true,” the spokesperson outrightly replied to DUBAWA  via a text message. The claim that the Federal Government of Nigeria is set to increase NYSC allowance from ₦33,000 to ₦45,000 is false.

Claim: A post on the Official EFCC Instagram account alleged that the commission sentenced eight suspected internet fraudsters to death.,"Claim: A post on the Official EFCC Instagram account alleged that the commission sentenced eight suspected internet fraudsters to death.  This claim that the EFCC sentenced eight suspected internet criminals to death is misleading and a clear misinterpretation from Instagram’s translator.  The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), established in 2003, is an executive body charged with enforcing law on finance-related crimes. This body adheres to its establishment Act of 2004 which confers on the commission the power to investigate and arrest offenders.  Recently, the screenshot of a post by the EFCC (@officialefcc) went viral on WhatsApp. This Instagram post claims eight individuals accused of cyber crime in Ilorin have been sentenced to death. ‘EFCC in Ilorin has sentenced eight people to death for cyber crimes,’ part of the post reads.  The post identified the offence and names of the suspects. Is the penalty for internet fraud death? This question prompted us to look into this claim.  Dubawa first traced the commission’s page on Instagram and found the original post. The original post was written in Igbo language, requiring a non-Igbo speaking user to use the artificial translator on Instagram to get the content of this post. We observed that the screenshot shared on WhatsApp was that of the translated version of the post. This translated version on Instagram had attracted a lot of criticism from the public. An Instagram user went as far as saying ‘the account was under attack.’ We also observed from the comment section that some users who understood Igbo noted there was an error. One user noted that the translation had a typographical error, adding that the original message was ‘EFCC has arrested 8 suspects of internet crimes.’ Another user also said it was the fault of the translator.  This prompted us to get a human translator who confirmed that in the original text (Igbo), there was nothing like a death sentence but of an arrest made by the EFCC.  Also, a keyword search on this led to a report by  Channels Television in English. This report noted that eight persons were arrested over alleged involvement in cyber fraud.  Our findings show that the post announced the arrest of eight suspects of cyber or internet crime in Ilorin. Normally, the EFCC does not have a judicial function, only investigation and prosecution. The EFCC did not pronounce a death sentence. This makes the translation in the  viral screenshot misleading.

"Claim: A web-based message circulating on WhatsApp claims that Bola Ahmed Tinubu is granting Nigerians an assistive grant of 25,000 Naira.","Bola Ahmed Tinubu, a prominent Nigerian politician and current National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), was a two-term governor of Lagos State whose influence in the Nigerian political sphere makes him a popular subject of discourse. Mr Tinubu, who recently declared his intention to run for president in the upcoming 2023 elections, has been making appearances on diverse media platforms reiterating his intentions for the presidency. It is in the light of this context that a certain web-based message is making the rounds on WhatsApp, alleging that Mr Tinubu, through the ‘Tinubu Support Organization 2022,’ is granting Nigerians an assistive grant of N25,000. In 2021, DUBAWA fact-checked a similar claim that Mr. Tinubu was offering N19, 800 grants to Nigerians. After our extensive research on the claim, we were able to deduce that the 19,800 support grant is a hoax.  Another link has been developed with a ‘newly-improved’ N25,000 grant to Nigerians. With the 2023 presidential election in sight, it becomes pertinent to recheck this claim and inform Nigerians.  The link provided in the web-based message has the image of Tinubu on its landing page and an alleged emblem and insignia of the Bola Tinubu Support Organization, a non-governmental organization (NGO), that was founded on September 20th, 2019 by some individuals. DUBAWA finds fact-checking this claim crucial ahead of the 2023 presidential election for which Tinubu has openly declared his candidacy.  Such juicy grant offers are usually newsworthy events. As such,  DUBAWA carried out a keyword search on the internet regarding the grants. Findings  showed that no NGO is offering such grants to Nigerians. Even so, there are no official statements or media reports from the presidential aspirant to confirm the validity of the claim.  Interestingly, an analysis of the link on Domainbigdata, a web service used to verify domain’s ownership, reveals multiple users have reported the website for abuses, attacks, and implanting malicious viruses on multiple occasions. Another outright red flag was the presence of dummy testimonial remarks. This is a common tactic employed by internet con artists to entice potential victims into their cave. The supposed links to the comments are not clickable, but still serve as a forged dummy, only designed to mislead users.  DUBAWA also noticed that the link is a ‘Bitly URL.’ Bitly URL is a link shortening and management application that was founded in 2008. Bitly shortens over 600 million links per month for social media, text messaging, and email. The goal of its establishment was to make it easier for entrepreneurs to post their links on social media, attract clients, and sell their products or services. However,  charlatans are increasingly using Bitly URL to spread false information and drive traffic to their malicious websites. Apparently, the WhatsApp user who shared the information to a WhatsApp group shared the information based on the instructions embedded on the website. See the image below. Furthermore, the supposed website requires visitors to exchange further information with other users before being able to access the grant, as seen in the screenshot above. This is a common scam method employed by con artists to get people to visit their websites. Also known as BTSO, Bola Tinubu Support Organization does exist. It is a group established by a few individuals: Comrade Abubakar Kuso became the National Coordinator, Princess Sade Olamide (Director Admin.,) Mallam Musa (Director Finance), Alhaji Ibrahim Gazama (National Youth leader) etc. Notably, the real website of the Bola Tinubu Support Organization does not offer “grants” of N25,000 to Nigerians. The website also has a real domain, which further authenticates the maliciousness of the acclaimed link. The links of Bola Tinubu on the website appear to take the visitors to another site entirely.  As it appears, Tinubu is not offering grants to Nigerians, and the website is a hoax, based on the findings of the investigation. Bola Ahmed Tinubu, or any of his organizations, is not offering ₦25,000 as a grant to Nigerians. Online scammers use this strategy to entice and extort money from unwary members of the public.

"Claim: A message circulating on WhatsApp, claims to offer the 2022/2023 Commonwealth scholarship programme","The Commonwealth of Nations is a political association that comprises 54 states (countries) which are former territories of the British empire. Connected by the use of English Language, they share the similar values of democracy, human rights and the rule of law. Scholarships, such as the Commonwealth’s, are highly competitive opportunities that different individuals seek across many countries in the world. As stated on Commonwealth Scholarship Commission’s website, the “Commonwealth scholarships enable talented and motivated individuals to gain the knowledge and skills required for sustainable development, and are offered to citizens from low and middle income Commonwealth countries.” It allows beneficiaries to study at the universities in the UK. It is perhaps because of the reverential attention that people give to the scholarship programmes that a post advertising the “2022/2023 Commonwealth Free Scholarship Programme that allows students to study, work and live in the United Kingdom” has been recirculated across WhatsApp groups. Aside from travel expenses, student visa and work permit, accommodation and medical facilities, the post also promised beneficiaries “visa application assistance, no agent fee, 100% free course fee and paid internship”. The message provides a link which users would click to commence registration. After clicking, the user is redirected to a page that requests bio-data.   The redirected page requesting users’ bio-data Users are consequently asked to select current academic level, preferred program and preferred United Kingdom state, before being redirected to another page that asks them to “share (on WhatsApp) until the blue bar is full” before they can “generate visa form”.  On several occasions, DUBAWA has debunked similar ventures promising juicy returns, scholarships, loans and promos that at the end are fraudulent schemes meant to defraud unsuspecting members of the public. DUBAWA first took notice of the irregularities of the alleged facebook comments that were showcased as testimonials of former successful candidates of the scheme. Although similar to that of Facebook, which displays names, pictures and the time people made their comments, three major red flags were noticed. First, none of the items in the section was clickable; this means that the comments were not real since they carry no hyperlinks to trace their genuine source. Secondly,  the timeline for the comments  remains static, reading  “just now” for the first five comments and “2 mins ago” for the last comment, regardless of the time the page is visited. This is usually a forged comment meant to lure unsuspecting users.  Even more alarming is the fact that the alleged scheme promised potential applicants no IELTS requirement for the scholarships. The “International English Language Testing System” (IELTS)  is an examination that tests the “English Language proficiency of non-native English language speakers.” In order words, the examination is for the citizens of countries who use English as their second language. Nigeria is an example of such countries. It is thus natural for such a juicy off to raise an alarm such as can spark curiosity on the part of fact-checkers. A close attention to the alleged website (UNITED KINGDOM FREE SCHOLARSHIPS 2022/2023 (enroll-now.online)) offering the scholarship differs from the actual Commonwealth’s Scholarship Commission website, “https://cscuk.fcdo.gov.uk/about-us/scholarships/” When DUBAWA also reached out to the Commonwealth Scholarship Commission (CSC) via an email regarding the accuracy of the circulating scholarship link, the commission confirmed that the link was not from them and that  it is not part of their scholarship programmes.   “I can confirm the CSC offers a variety of scholarships to students wanting to study abroad. Each scholarship will provide unique opportunities and may have different levels of support. “Some applications are still open, whilst others have unfortunately closed now. I will provide a link below to all the scholarships we offer so you can gain some more information about these opportunities.”  Resultantly, the alleged link is confirmed to be an alien link and not a part of links sent by the CSC, nor does it share any affiliation with the commission.   Furthermore, an analysis of the website on ScamDoc (a web tool that evaluates “digital identities’” reliability {email address or website} and provides answers to questions frequently asked by Internet users such as: How to check if a website is reliable or not? How to detect fraudulent emails?) reveals that the domain name is very recent (less than 6 months old) with a short life expectancy that is linked to one or more countries known for being used by fraudulent websites similar to websites DUBAWA had analyzed in the past.  Results of the analysis from ScamDoc Furthermore, the website was also discovered to be malvertizing (a word that blends malware and advertising,  to refer to techniques cybercriminals use to target people covertly) by demanding users to share the link to groups on WhatsApp. ‘Malvertizing’ is carried out by buying ad space on trustworthy websites. While the ads may appear legitimate (as the one under scrutiny), there is a malicious code hidden inside them that redirects users to fraudulent websites or installs malware on their computers or mobile devices that keep bringing up notifications.  The acclaimed link offering users Commonwealth scholarships is fraudulent and was created to deceive unsuspecting members of the public into falling victims of fraudulent schemes. This claim is false.   ",FALSE,11/02/2022,https://dubawa.org/scammers-use-malicious-link-in-guise-of-commonwealth-scholarship-programme-to-defraud-online-users/
"Claim: A Facebook post quoted the Health Minister to have said that government hospitals across the country would be offering free deoxyribonucleic acid test, also known as DNA test, to interested Nigerians from June, 2022.","A Facebook User shared a post that the Federal Government has announced that it would begin free DNA tests for Nigerians from June 2022. The post quoted the Health Minister to have made the claim.  The claim, which has since generated a lot of reactions and has enjoyed wide circulation on social media was captioned, ‘BREAKING: Govt Hospitals in Nigeria Will Be Offering FREE DNA TEST from the Month of June, 2022. – Health Minister.’  The claim is coming at a time many Nigerians are calling for a reduction in the price of DNA paternity tests. Recently, there have been reports and discussions in Nigeria over the increase in paternity fraud.  Celebrities, politicians and many Nigerians were reportedly involved in paternity fraud, and this has led to the increase in DNA testing across the country.  According to the Cleveland Clinic, DNA is the genetic material you inherit from your mother and father. The DNA paternity test is nearly 100% accurate at determining whether a man is another person’s biological father. DNA paternity tests are unraveling a lot of buried family secrets. Keeping family secrets isn’t as easy as it used to be and just one DNA test could change everything for better or for worse. Taking advantage of the situation, the Facebook User shared the post that the government would soon be offering DNA tests free.  Reading through comments on the post, Dubawa observed that many people believed the post, as some even noted that free DNA paternity tests would cause ‘problems’ in many marriages.  A Facebook user, Oduh Omada commented, “This is good News. I pity those wey no resemble their Papa or mama.”  Another user, Idoko Omoba Vicktor, wrote,  “Hmmmmm, there will be plenty of wrong results I promise you, confusion go dey everywhere.”  Bauxy Pete Abah stressed, “Seriously 😂 Welcome to the season of infidelity outburst. Broken homes loading…..30%”  When Dubawa searched the internet, it was discovered that there was no news report, statement or press release about free DNA tests in government hospitals credited to either the Minister for Health, Dr Osagie Ehanire, or minister of state for health, Dr Olorunnimbe Mamora.  It was discovered that Nigerian health officials also refute the rumours in a report by National dailies like Punch and Daily Independent.  Reading through the report published by Punch, Dubawa discovered that the Minister of State for Health, Dr Olorunmimbe Mamora debunked while speaking with the news organisation the news about free DNA tests for Nigerians. The minister was quoted to have said, “This is a false claim. At no point did I or the minister say this. The claims about free DNA tests are not true.” The post  is false as the minister of state for health, Dr Olorunnimbe Mamora, has confirmed that the claim did not emanate from the government.

Claim: The screenshot of a document has a claim that the International Common Law Court of Justice has prohibited the use of COVID Vaccines.,"Claim: The screenshot of a document has a claim that the International Common Law Court of Justice has prohibited the use of COVID Vaccines. Our findings show the document is doctored and there is no court named the International Common Law Court of Justice. Therefore, the claim that the International Common Law Court of Justice has prohibited the use of COVID-19 vaccines is false. The screenshot of a letter allegedly from the International Common Law Court of Justice (ICLCJ) has a claim that COVID-19 vaccines have been outlawed. This screenshot which has gone viral on WhatsApp was shared with the message, “Everyone should read this, copy and share with everyone you know in order to protect everyone’s human right.” The letter with the date January 15, 2022, was titled “public warrant prohibiting the use or imposition of COVID vaccines.” “LET IT BE KNOWN that the court has outlawed all COVID ‘vaccines’ and prohibited their use or imposition after lawfully convicting their manufacturers, including the corporation known as Pfizer Ltd., and GlaxoSmithKline Ltd., of crimes against humanity and of producing the COVID vaccine through the trafficking, torture, organ removal, murder, and genocide of children, indigenous people and other involuntary experimental test subjects,” part of the letter read.  This screenshot was also sent to DUBAWA for verification.  DUBAWA’S findings show the acclaimed organisation, International Common Law Court of Justice (ICLCJ), written beneath the logo on the letter, does not exist. Extensive research on the acclaimed organisation on the internet yielded no result.  Interestingly, the logo is that of the International Criminal Court (ICC), adopted by the claimant to mislead unsuspecting members of the public.  Even more, when DUBAWA conducted a reverse image search of the acclaimed letter, a similar post with the claims attributed to ICLCJ emerged on Twitter. This time, the user,  Kym Burt (@KymBurt4) claims  that government leaders and others face arrest after being convicted of genocide.  “Big parma, government leaders face arrest as court convicts them of genocide, prohibits injections….,” part of the Twitter post read. Attached to this Twitter post was a link to a news story by Rumble published January 15 2022. This report carries the same claim as the Twitter post. “A groundbreaking announcement announces the conviction of those involved in global genocide. It gives every man and woman on the planet the authority to seize and destroy any and all Covid-19 paraphernalia,” part of the report read. We also found a fact-check debunking the claim in this Twitter post. This check by Agence France -Presse (AFP) Canada debunked the claim about COVID vaccine genocide and arrest.  Using the Forensic tool, forensically,  an error level analysis was carried out on the image. At different levels of analysis, the result showed the document was doctored by using a correcting fluid on the original paper to forge a new narrative.  Also, hard copy documents presented online do not carry a hyperlink because  hard copy documents are not meant to function online. However, analysis of this document showed a blue-coloured text which shows there is a link around the signature line. This, in itself, is a major red flag. Our findings show the document is doctored and there is no court named the International Common Law Court of Justice. Therefore, the claim that the International Common Law Court of Justice has prohibited the use of COVID-19 vaccines is false.

Claim: A viral social media post claims Apple info-tech company is making a ‘smart wedding ring’ that makes it possible for couples to spy on each other.,"Technology is a transformer, a consistently transient charter that is ever evolving. As such, no invention may seem impossible, no matter how ridiculous it may appear. This is perhaps why a claim about an alleged Apple’s new invention is making the rounds.  Shared in a recent social media post,  the claim alleged that Apple, the largest information technology company, is making a ‘smart wedding ring’ that makes it possible for couples to spy on each other.  The claimant, ‘SAY CHEESE!’ (@SaycheeseDGTL) who shared the post on Twitter gave some details:  “Apple is working on developing smart wedding rings which will let you know your partner’s location, where they have been, and if they take the ring off.” Unsurprisingly, the post attracted over 10,000 reactions and diverse comments that appear to trigger laughter, questions and bewilderment amongst users who came across the claim.  One user, sxyalicer0se (@sxyalicer0se90), wrote: “That is stalkerish to the extreme. This would get so many women killed by abusive partners. What if we spent too long at the store or we had to take a detour and our man suspects us cheating? Or we had to secretly go to the doctor to get a checkup or an abortion? We will all be killed.” Yet the conversation didn’t stop there.  The claim was also extended to WhatsApp as a screenshot, where it featured on groups and users’ statuses. It aroused diverse reactions and mostly questions about its efficacy.   Interestingly, some media outlets, such as Oasis magazine, even reported on the topic  with the headline: “Apple Develops Smart Wedding Rings that Makes Partners Know Locations Visited.” Relatedly, many online narratives, such as the one under scrutiny, have been taken seriously over the years, and the claim that Apple is making a ‘smart wedding ring’ appears unignorable.  In reality, the findings revealed that the claim is untrue and merely a ‘joke’. According to a report by ‘Apple Insider,’ Apple’s product website since 1997, the information has been a ‘joke’ and is totally untrue. The report clarified that: “The gag originally started as just another concept. In 2007, Yanko Design published a description, with the same image used in the current tweet, as if it were a real product. If you’re familiar with Apple products, you know that the plastic and design is reminiscent of even earlier than 2007, with it mostly resembling the company’s blue and white or Bondi days.” Truly, the heralding picture of the ‘iRing’ was traced back to a publication by Yanko Design in 2007. The post detailed the idea of a tech ring that allows users to increase and decrease the volume of their iPhone devices.  Although the report did term the tech rings as ‘iRing,’ it never mentioned it was for couples’ location monitoring. In fact, the publication clearly stated that:  “With a stylish design and wireless Bluetooth connectivity with your iPod and iPhone, the iRing allows you to control playback and volume on any of your Apple media devices iRing features a bright OLED status display with touch-sensitive function strip, and a rechargeable battery life of up to 2 days, conveniently recharging your iRing using the included cradle. Its minimal size and unique ring-lock mechanism make it an ideal companion for charging and storing your iRing. Apparently, the Yanko design publications fell victim to a twisted narrative. There is no such location monitoring ‘iRings’ for couples and the claim is false and merely satire and an unfounded social media joke that went viral.

"CLAIM: A Facebook post with a gory picture suggests there was another ritual killing in Ogun State, a few days after some teenagers were caught with a human head in the state.","A Facebook User shared a gory photo with a caption that another ritual killing has taken place in Ogun State, just a few days after some teenagers were caught with a human head in the state.  The claim which was was widely circulated on social media was captioned: ‘FLASH 💥 : Another money ritual killing in Ogun State.. Hummmmm 😥  ‘ May God Almighty end all this madness! #SayNoToRitual.’  The Facebook Post is coming just a few days after three teenage boys were caught burning the head of a girl, said to be in a relationship with one of them, for a money ritual in Oke Aregba area of Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital. The three teenagers were arrested by the men of the Ogun State Police Command on 29th January, 2022, following a tip-off by one Segun Adewusi, who is reportedly a community security guard. Since the arrest of the boys, there have been hot debates on social media regarding parenting and how young people are going extra-mile to look for quick money.  Taking advantage of the recent arrest, the Facebook User shared a photo of three suspected ritualists with the remains of someone suspected to have been used for ritual.  Reading through comments on the post, DUBAWA observed that many believed another ritual killing actually happened in Ogun state.  A Facebook user, Damilola Oscar Jay, commented: “I think they should change the state’s name from Ogun to anything else”(sic). Another user, Afolabi Amos queried, “OGUN STATE again?  Na curse?”   When DUBAWA conducted a Google Reverse Image Search on the photo, it led to a news report published by many national newspapers on 25th September, 2021.  The news report was published by Guardian, Leadership, Vanguard, among others.  The news report which many captioned: ‘Man arrested for allegedly killing his brother for rituals in Kwara’ was accompanied with the photo of the suspected ritualists with the remains of the said brother.  Reading through the report published by Guardian, DUBAWA discovered that it was the Kwara State Command of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), that arrested one lsmail Saliu, for allegedly conspiring with a herbalist and one other person, to slaughter his brother. In the report, Saliu was alleged to have conspired with two others and killed his 14-year-old younger brother, Azeez Saliu, with the intention of using him for money rituals.  DUBAWA also contacted the Ogun State Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Abimbola Oyeyemi, who described the post as misleading and untrue.  Oyeyemi explained that the police in Ogun State did not arrest any ritualists apart from the teenagers that were caught last week.  He added, “I don’t know where they see that picture they are circulating around. Nothing like that happened here.” The post  is misleading as the picture used was an old photo of the arrest of some suspected ritualists in Kwara State, the Police has also debunked the claim as misleading and untrue.

Claim: A Twitter user claims the Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) will end March 22.,"The Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) for the 2023 general election commenced Monday, June 28, 2021. This process is currently ongoing for eligible voters who are not on the country’s voter’s register, to get registered before the election. On Wednesday, February 2, 2022, a Twitter user Mo-Mo (@Moris_Monye), calling on the public to register, claimed the CVR exercise will end March 22, 2022.  “I use God beg you, let us register. This will close March 22nd 2022” part of the tweet read. Reacting to his post, another Twitter user Noble (@noble_idy) countered this claim, noting the exercise  will be suspended on June 30. “March 22 is the end of the 3rd quarter. The last quarter starts April 11 to June 30, and then CVR is suspended” his comment read. A keyboard search on the CVR process led to several news reports on the announcement of the commencement of the process in June 2021. According to this report by the Cable, the INEC Chairman , Mahmood Yakubu, said “Effective from Monday 28th June 2021, the CVR exercise will commence nationwide and be carried out continuously for over a year until the third quarter of 2022.” Another report by Channels Television noted that the chairman said the commission will continue the exercise on a quarterly basis for one year, beginning Monday, June 28, 2021. Also, this video by Channels shows the chairman, saying “We intend to undertake the CVR exercise over a period of at least one year.”  DUBAWA reached out to INEC’s National Commissioner, Festus Okoye, and the Chief Press Secretary (CPS) to the National Chairman, Rotimi Oyekanmi, to clarify when the CVR is expected to end. Mr Festus Okoye, provided an image of the CVR timetable which showed that the registration exercise is divided into four quarters and will end June 30, 2022.  The first quarter was from June 28 to September 21, the second quarter from October 4 to December 30, the third quarter from January 3 to March 22 and the fourth quarter from April 11 to June 30, 2022. Mr Rotimi Oyekanmi, also responded to our inquiry saying “Not true. the CVR will not close earlier than June.” The claim that registration to vote in 2023 will end March 22 is false. The commission’s  timetable for the exercise reveals the exercise is scheduled to end June 30, not March 22, 2022. The date, March 22, 2022, is the end of the third quarter of the exercise which is scheduled to last for four quarters.

"Claim: A post, widely circulated on WhatsApp, suggests that the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) has put payment of the January 2022 allowance for corps members on hold until further notice.","Many people on WhatsApp on 27 January, 2022 circulated a screenshot of a report by Vanguard claiming that NYSC has put the payment of monthly allowance on hold until further notice.  The claim which was mostly posted on WhatsApp status reads: ‘NYSC monthly allowance has been put on hold for the month of january 2022 till further notice.’  Serving corps members are expected to be paid a N33,000 allowance monthly towards the end of every month. However, this post has led to some apprehension as they are not sure their payment would come in for the month. Omobolanle Kamarudeen, a corps member in Oyo State, said she thought the post was true because she was yet to receive the January allowance.  “This is January 27, and they have not paid us. I am beginning to fear that this post may be true”, she said  Another corps member, Anjolaoluwa Omotosho, serving in Ogun State, told Dubawa she shared the post on her status.  She explained, “I saw it on the status of my friend and I thought it was true since we are yet to receive our January allowance.” The NYSC is a one year compulsory service Nigerian graduates are expected to undergo after completion of their tertiary studies. It was set up by the military government in 1973 to foster unity and national development. Dubawa checked the Vanguard website to see if there is any report about NYSC about putting the January 2022 allowance payment on hold till further notice. It was discovered that there was no such report on the website. Dubawa also contacted the online editor of Vanguard, Victor Ogunyinka, who insisted the newspaper did not publish any report regarding delay in NYSC allowance.  Ogunyinka said he searched through the Vanguard database after our enquiry and could not find any report about that delay in the payment of NYSC allowance as suggested in the screenshot. “I can tell you for sure that we don’t have that story on our website,” he said.

NYSC spokesperson, Emeka Mgbemena, told Dubawa that the report is not true. “It’s not true. Disregard that please.

Claim: A popular Facebook page named Football World claimed that the Sierra Leone national team arrived in Cameroon by boat as a result of inadequate resources to book a flight.,"Claim: A popular Facebook page named Football World claimed that the Sierra Leone national team arrived in Cameroon by boat as a result of inadequate resources to book a flight. The team travelled with a chartered airline to Cameroon and not a boat. Full Text Football World, a popular football page with over a million followers, recently posted images of the Sierra Leone national football team after its goalless draw with the defending African champions, the desert foxes of Algeria.  Reporting on their facebook page on the resilient performance from the Leone stars, Football World claimed the national team travelled from Sierra Leone to Cameroon on a boat. According to the report, the Sierra Leone Football Association (SLFA) had limited resources to pay for a flight and therefore had to resort to a cheaper means of transport, a boat, for a 2000 kilometer journey from Freetown to Cameroon. “Their fans said goodbye with kisses on the feet and arrived in Cameroon in boats, given the few resources that their federation has to pay for flights. Thus, they traveled more than 2,000 kilometers…,”part of the post reads. The report by Football World follows a stellar performance by the Leone Stars in the opening Group E match against defending champions Algeria which ended in a stalemate. It is the first AFCON appearance by the Leone Stars in 26 years.  With the post attracting close to  90,000 likes on the Facebook page, over  8,000 combined comments and shares, and given how convinced a good number of people were in response to the claim, Dubawa saw the need to fact-check the story and to correct possible cases of misrepresentation in the story.  Football World failed to note that Sierra Leone’s international Airport, named the Lungi International Airport, is separated from the city by the Sierra Leone river estuary on the north side of the harbour for Lungi and the south side of the harbour for Freetown. This clearly means that to access the airport for travel purposes, one would have to use a speed boat or a  ferry if they want to avoid making the road trip from Freetown to Lungi or take the alternative of going through the northern town of Port Loko via road which is also time-consuming.. In fact, a viral video shared on social media showed some football fans cheering their national team while boarding a boat to access the Lungi International Airport. The video featured players on the boat sharing felicitations and assuring the people of Sierra Leone of a successful tournament. It was evident the team was headed to  Lungi via the boat taxi and not directly to Cameroon as claimed by Football world.  Also, an  instagram live video by the veteran Sierra Leonean attacker and a member of Leone Stars, Kei Kamara, showed the team on the boat taxi and as the team transited from the boat to a bus that took them to the airport. “You gotta get on a bus to get to the plane,” Kamara said moments after they disembarked from the boat and boarded the bus to Lungi airport. Viral images of the Sierra Leone delegation at the Lungi International Airport as they prepared to board  their flight to Cameroon also counter the claim made by Football World. As seen in the photos shared on the Sierra Leone Football Association Twitter page, the Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) was the chartered aircraft that flew the team to Cameroon.  Photo Credit- SLFA twitter page Dubawa further reached out to Ibrahim Kamara who is the head of media and marketing of the Sierra Leone Football Association currently in Cameroon and he refuted the claim by emphasizing that the national team had a chartered flight that took the delegation to Cameroon. Conclusion Whilst it is confirmed that the team did board a boat as they departed Freetown, it is inaccurate to suggest that they travelled to Cameroon on a boat because they lacked the financial muscle to board a flight for the AFCON competition. A chartered flight was used. ",FALSE,21/01/2022,https://dubawa.org/the-sierra-leone-football-team-did-not-travel-by-boat-to-cameroon-for-afcon2021-as-claimed-by-football-world/
Claim: A health influencer claims drinking zobo (Hibiscus sabdariffa) leads to miscarriage.,"Zobo, a popular Hausa name given to the drink made from Hibiscus sabdariffa, has been known to have many health benefits and has become part of cocktails at events and parties in Nigeria. Recently, a health influencer, Dr. Udomoh (@Nigerian Health Blog) in a Twitter post, claims the consumption of zobo leads to miscarriage. “If you are pregnant, please don’t drink ZOBO. There are verified reports of women who had a miscarriage after drinking zobo” the Twitter post read. The claim, with over 600 retweets generated mixed reactions. A Twitter user @thebrandOma wrote she had zobo during her last pregnancy but was not affected by it.  “My last pregnancy I drank zobo like water cause my former neighbour kept her zobo in my freezer to chill before going to sell, but recently I heard this at the clinic I realised maybe my body didn’t react to it but I still avoid it,” she narrated.  Another user @tesemofcolor wrote that her two pregnancies were not affected even though she drank zobo but knew someone who wasn’t as lucky. “Me too drank zobo during both my pregnancies and carried to full term. i know someone who had a miscarriage because of it though, bodies are just different but you’re right to avoid it to be safe” she narrated.  Dr Udomoh subsequently added to his tweet; “No two pregnancies are the same. Women are also different in make up….Some other women who take zobo have had a miscarriage. I know a woman who doesn’t want to see zobo during her pregnancy cos she said it caused her last two miscarriages”. Many questioned if this was just a coincidence or there is a science to it, hence the need to verify the claim.  DUBAWA found reports by Nimedhealth.com.ng and Guardian which agrees with this claim. Also, this study by Enwerem and Azuine on hibiscus sabdariffa’s safety and efficacy during pregnancy and lactation noted that while there was no scientific evidence to support the use of hibiscus sabdariffa during pregnancy and lactation there is in vitro evidence from animal studies that the seeds of Hibiscus sabdariffa have lactogenic effect.  The study therefore recommends a need to be cautious with the use of hibiscus sabdariffa during pregnancy and lactation until human research is done. Grace Odoma, a matron at Novelty hospital Abuja, agrees with this claim, noting that zobo contains an agent that inhibits the production of oestrogen which is vital to fertility. “Oestrogen is a female hormone which helps to regulate the secretion of gonadotropin hormone which is required for fertility to take place, also it helps in maturation and maintenance of the uterus which houses the foetus.  “This zobo contains an agent that inhibits the production of oestrogen  how ever leading to numerous side effects such as low birth weight, miscarriages ( preterm labour for 24 weeks gestation) and can cause abortion leading to bleeding as the uterus will contract uncontrollably leadiing to excess loss of blood,” she explained. A gynaecologist at the National Hospital, Abuja, Dr. Jeremiah Agim, provided links to two studies that shows that  Hibiscus sabdariffa (zobo) relaxes the uterus instead of causing contractions. He said some argue that it is the pineapple in the zobo that causes the contraction. While this study shows that pineapples have contractile effect on rat and human pregnant myometrial muscle in vitro. Further studies are needed to fully establish this claim. Another health official, Dr. Lynda Effiong-Agim, a medical Officer at Chivar Specialist Hospital Abuja, also agrees with other experts, noting that the study on rats alone is enough to be cautious with its use during pregnancy.  “It should be avoided in pregnancy… animal studies have shown the relationship between consuming zobo (hibiscus sabdariffa) and miscarriage. Although human studies are yet to be conducted, that alone is enough reason to be cautious,” she said. Although studies linking Hibiscus sabdariffa to miscarriage were carried out on rats, experts believe it may be enough for women to take caution with its use during pregnancy while we await human studies on the subject.

Claim: A social media post recently claimed that past Oyo State Governors died at 71.,"Claim: A social media post recently claimed that past Oyo State Governors died at 71. The claim is largely incorrect as only two of the five, Chief Bola Ige and Adebayo Alao-Akala were 71-year-old when they died. A social media post, which went viral on Friday, 14th January 2022, claimed that five past governors of Oyo State died at the age of 71 years.  The post, which has gone viral and has been shared multiple times on WhatsApp, especially, listed former Governors of Oyo State, Bola Ige, Kolapo Ishola, Lamidi (Lam) Adesina, Abiola Ajimobi and Adebayo Alao-Akala to have died at 71. The post had an accompanying message that reads, ‘What can we say about this?’ suggesting that this occurrence might be a coincidence or jinx.  The post has continued to be circulated on social media and it has elicited rife speculations and cross postings on many groups on WhatsApp, so it was necessary to verify these claims and clear the air.  Verification  Using news stories and commentaries from credible platforms, this writer opted to verify if the claim is true or false. Chief Bola Ige, who was governor of the old Oyo State from 1979 to 1983, was shot dead in his Ibadan, Oyo State capital, residence on December 23, 2001. Bola Ige was born in Esa Oke, Osun State on September 13, 1930. He was aged 71 at the time of his death. Checks showed that Chief Kolapo Ishola died in 2011 at the age of 77. Kolapo Ishola was Oyo State governor between 1991 and 1993. Lamidi Adesina was governor of Oyo State from 1999 to 2003. Alhaji Lamidi Adesina died in 2012 at the age of 73. Adesina, who died at St. Nicholas Hospital, Lagos after a protracted illness, would have celebrated his 74th birthday if he had been alive in January 2013. Senator Abiola Ajimobi was born on 16 December 1949 to the Ajimobi of Ibadan at Oja-Oba, Ibadan. And he was governor from 2011 to 2019.  Ajimobi died on 25 June 2020 at a private hospital in Lagos after spending weeks in intensive care for coronavirus complications. He was 70.  Otunba Christopher Adebayo Alao-Akala was governor from 2007 to 2011. Alao-Akala died in his Ogbomoso residence on Wednesday, 12 January 2022, at the age of 71.  He was born on June 3, 1950, at Ogbomoso in Ogbomoso North Local Government Area of Oyo State. From the foregoing revelations, it is evident that Chief Bola Ige was 71 when he was assassinated in December 2001, Kolapo Ishola was 77 when he died in 2011 and Alhaji Lam Adesina was 73 when he died in 2012. Also, Abiola Ajimobi was 70 years and six months when he died in June 2020, and Alao-Akala was 71 when he died on Wednesday 12 January 2022. The claim that past Oyo State governors died at the age of 71 is largely incorrect, as only Bola Ige and Alao-Akala were 71 at the time of their death.

Claim: The Union of Campus Journalists (UCJ) at the University of Ilorin (UCJ UNILORIN) is the oldest campus news outlet in Nigeria.,"Student-led media organisations are changing the face of Nigeria’s news industry; arming students with relevant journalistic skills and tools and awakening them to the responsibility of accountability in the society. One of these is the Union of Campus Journalists (UCJ) at the University of Ilorin (UNILORIN), Kwara State in North-Central Nigeria. Recently, IJNet, a publication of the International Center for Journalists (ICJ), reported how this organisation is advancing journalism in Nigeria, serving as a voice for students and “offering passionate students with little to no experience in journalism an opportunity to develop their talents.” The report designated UCJ UNILORIN, founded in 1996, as the “oldest campus news outlet in Nigeria.” There are over 68 student-led media organisations in tertiary institutions across Nigeria, according to the National Union of Campus Journalists (NUCJ), which oversees their activities.  They are registered as institutional press clubs, Unions of Campus Journalists (UCJ) or Associations of Campus Journalists (ACJ), and operate as news outlets on their respective campuses. Assessing the claim by IJNet, Dubawa reached out to Samuel Ajala, President of the National Union of Campus Journalists (NUCJ); the umbrella body of student-led media organizations in Nigeria. Mr Ajala said that the campus outlet at the University of Ibadan, and not that at University of Ilorin, is the oldest in Nigeria. “UCJ U.I is the oldest and not UNILORIN,” he told Dubawa. The Union of Campus Journalists (UCJ) at the University of Ibadan was established on June 17, 1987. It “has successfully produced 32 presidents and thousands of campus journalists and influential pillars of society,” Martins Isaac, who led the organization, told TheCable in 2019. Further research by Dubawa found a report announcing the emergence of Faith Alofe as the 50th President of the Association of Campus Journalists (ACJ), the student-led media organisation at the Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife. Alofe, who was elected on September 25, 2021, is the first female President of the association. “ACJ OAU was founded alongside the institution’s students union,” she said, tracing the history of the campus media outlet. The OAU students’ union was formed in 1963; a year after the university was established. Corroborating Alofe’s position, Olusola Oludiran, who led ACJ-OAU in the 2018/2019 session, told Dubawa that the campus media organization had enjoyed the membership of notable personalities including human rights lawyer and Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Femi Falana; the university’s current vice chancellor, Eyitope Ogunbodede, and Publisher of Nigeria’s leading newsroom, Premium Times, Dapo Olorunyomi. “Many notable Nigerians today were members of ACJ during their days at OAU, many years ago. For instance Femi Falana SAN, who graduated from OAU in 1981, was a member of the ACJ. Mr Dapo Olorunyomi, publisher of Premium Times, was also a president of the ACJ OAU,” Oludiran, who was the organization’s 48th president, told Dubawa. “It is important for people to know their history, to avoid distorting it.” Contrary to the claim that UCJ University of Ilorin, founded in 1996, is the “oldest campus news outlet in Nigeria,” Dubawa found that campus news outlets in two other universities – UCJ University of Ibadan (1987) and ACJ Obafemi Awolowo University (1963), pre-existed before that of the University of Ilorin. Setting the records straight, ACJ Obafemi Awolowo University is the oldest campus news outlet in Nigeria.

"After the Omicron variant of COVID-19 was discovered,  there have been amid other concerns, amid concerns that vaccines won’t be effective against the new strand, thereby fueling vaccine hesitancy.","After the Omicron variant of COVID-19 was discovered,  there have been amid other concerns, amid concerns that vaccines won’t be effective against the new strand, thereby fueling vaccine hesitancy. Recently, a viral WhatsApp message made several claims around vaccines, vaccinated and unvaccinated people. According to this message, fully vaccinated people pose a threat in winter and must be quarantined while others claim that vaccines do not work. The message also claims the booster shots make COVID-19  cases worse and that unvaccinated persons are not dangerous. Seeing that this message contains several claims, Dubawa identified the different claims and verified them individually.  Claim 1: Vaccinated people must be quarantined in winter because they pose a danger. False This WhatsApp message claims that vaccinated persons must be quarantined over the winter months or else risk serious illnesses. This claim was allegedly made by Christian Perronne, a former vice president of the World Health Organisation’s European Advisory Group of Experts in Immunisation. “The World Health Organisation European Advisory Group of Experts in Immunisation, former vice president, professor Christain Perronne, yesterday said that all vaccinated people must be quarantined over the winter months or risk serious illnesses.” Excerpt of the claim.  A keyword search led to a Twitter post by Dr. Jesse Livermore LL.M.,PH.D (@JessieLivermore) on September 20, 2021 with a similar claim. In this tweet the claim is that Pfizer said vaccinated people can harm unvaccinated people. This tweet had the link to a website which carries a story from May 2021 where Pfizer allegedly confirmed that vaccinated people can shed spike protein and harm the unvaccinated.  The WHO has approved 8 vaccines for COVID-19  after having vetted their efficiency, effectiveness and safety. According to Bloomberg, more than 8.23 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered across 184 countries. Fully vaccinated persons according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), are less likely to develop serious illness and vaccine shedding can only occur when a vaccine contains a weakened version of the virus which is not so in the case of the COVID-19 vaccines. The spike proteins (which is also found on the surface of the virus that causes COVID-19) in the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, which use mRNA technology, are produced after the vaccine sends instructions to the body’s cells.   The cells make the protein which our immune system recognizes as a foreign body and responds to by producing antibodies. The spike proteins are harmless, do not cause illness and do not last long in the body. This makes the claim false. Christian Perronne is a Professor of Infectious and Tropical Diseases at the University of Versailles-St Quentin, Paris-Saclay, France. He has, however, been identified as a controversial doctor known in conspiracy theory circles for his criticism of health policy in the fight against COVID-19. Our search on the said WHO advisory group led us to the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) which indicates that Christin Perronne is not on the list of current and former members. The current chair of SAGE is Dr. Alejandro Cravioto.  Claim 2: Unvaccinated people are not dangerous False Unvaccinated persons are still a risk to people around them, especially people with weak immune systems. Christopher Martin, a professor of public health at West Virginia University, was reported to have said that these unvaccinated groups create more opportunity for the virus to mutate. “Large numbers of unvaccinated people do make variants more likely. If any one of these random errors confers an advantage to that virus, such as making it more contagious like delta, that variant can quickly become the dominant one circulating in the population,” he said. Although there have been “breakthrough” COVID cases among vaccinated persons, the majority of hospitalizations and ICU cases are among unvaccinated people.  Ghazala Sharieff, chief medical officer for acute care and clinical excellence said “The bottom line is that the COVID-19 vaccines are effective in preventing both infections and deaths”. Claim 3: 95% of seriously ill patients in Israel are vaccinated. Misleading The message also claims an Isreali doctor, Kobi Havi, said 95% of  seriously ill patients are vaccinated. “95% of seriously ill patients are vaccinated. Fully vaccinated people account for 85-90% of hospitalisation,” a part of the claim reads. Who is Hobi Haviv? According to one of the LinkedIn profiles found, Hobi Haviv is a team leader at Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries in Israel. Another profile says he is operational excellence leader, Elbit Land Systems at Elbit Systems Ltd. According to this report by haaretz.com, Dr. Kobi Haviv, is the head of the Herzog rehabilitation hospital in Jerusalem. We also found an interview video of Dr Haviv on UGETube with this claim in the caption. “Dr. Kobi Haviv, earlier today on Chanel 13 news Israel 13,”95 percent of the severe patients are vaccinated,” the caption reads.  Although the interview was not in English, it had English subtitles. Dr. Haviv said “most of the population is vaccinated, and 90%…85-90% of the hospitalisation here are fully vaccinated people. Yes unfortunately the vaccine, as they say, its effectiveness  is waning. Outbreaks in hospitals one patient infects a large number of people, it is not just here and there…” parts of the interview subtitle read.  According to Reuters, around half of Israel’s 600 patients presently hospitalised with severe illness have received two doses of the Pfizer vaccine. However, it notes that this is a rare occurrence out of 5.4 million fully vaccinated people. The majority of these patients who received two vaccine doses at least five months ago, are over the age of 60 and have chronic illnesses like diabetes, heart disease, lung ailments etc  known to exacerbate a coronavirus infection. Also, according to a study published in October in the New England Journal of Medicine, COVID-19 breakthrough cases were found in health care workers. “Among 11,453 fully vaccinated health care workers, 1497 (13.1%) underwent RT-PCR testing during the study period. Of the tested workers, 39 breakthrough cases were detected,” part of the study’s result reads.  While it is true that breakthrough cases have been found, the alleged percentage is misleading.  Claim 4: The effectiveness of vaccines is declining or disappearing Misleading It is true that immunity from the initial vaccine dose(s) naturally starts to wane over time which is the reason for booster shots, but this does not translate to vaccine effectiveness declining or disappearing.  Effectiveness of vaccines varies from one vaccine to another, but all approved vaccines are still effective against infection and severe illnesses. Real-world effectiveness data by CDC shows Johnson and Johnson is 71% effective at preventing hospitalisation from COVID-19 in adults who do not have compromised immune systems, whileModerna is 93% and Pfizer is 88% effective. Claim 5: Booster jabs will make cases worse False COVID-19 vaccine booster shots are now authorised for all adults in the U.S., and anyone 18 years and older who has completed the Pfizer or Moderna primary vaccine series at least six months ago or the Johnson & Johnson vaccine at least two months ago is eligible for a booster shot. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends boosters six months after the second dose of one of the mRNA COVID vaccines (Pfizer or Moderna)  because data on the vaccines’ efficacy suggests that after that amount of time has passed, the vaccines start to offer less protection. For Johnson and Johnson on the other hand, boosters are recommended two months after the first shot because the CDC data on the vaccine’s performance in real-world conditions showed that it is only 71% effective at preventing hospitalisation from COVID-19 in adults who did not have compromised immune systems. This is less, compared to Moderna’s 93% and Pfizer’s 88% effectiveness rate. Claim 6: Vaccines don’t work False Vaccines work, which is why they were given approval by the FDA. Although a study published in the Lancet shows that there is increasing evidence that vaccinated individuals continue to have a relevant role in transmission and that people with weak immune systems build lower levels of antibodies, there is still some protection from vaccination.  This viral WhatsApp message with several claims on COVID-19 is replete with falsehood. Looks like this article didn’t age well. Wow I am Glad to Find This Platform. It’s Very important.

Claim: Burning paper soaked in honey is repulsive to reptiles and will chase snakes away from houses and surroundings.,"Following the recent death of a female staff of the Nigerian Airforce from a snake bite in her toilet at her home in Abuja, more reports of snakes found in toilets have surfaced on the internet, sparking fear amongst many Nigerians and giving rise to various tips on how to keep snakes away from homes and surroundings. One of such is a viral image that claims that burning paper soaked in honey will drive snakes from homes or offices, as the smell of burning honey is repulsive for reptiles. “Burn a paper soaked with honey in the middle of the house/office. Keep doors open & snakes will run immediately as the smell of burnt honey is a strong repulsive nightmare for all dangerous reptiles,” it reads. The image, designed with the picture of a snake and text, urges members of the public to share the information. Further search by Dubawa uncovered a widely engaged post on Facebook promoting the burning of paper soaked in honey as a means to keep snakes away. The post authored by Sure Truth, a page that claims to provide “good body healthy tips, family tips above all natural home remedy with herbs,” had been shared over 1,700 times, also generating 576 likes and 190 comments. The same claim was also found on the official website of Boboye Oyeyemi, PhD, the Corps Marshal and Chief Executive of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC). Checks by Dubawa show that while burning honey is one of the ways to verify the authenticity and purity of honey, there is no evidence that burning a paper soaked in honey repels snakes. Doug Sofranko, a herpetologist, notes that some remedies purported to repel snakes such as the burning of honey, are actually harmless to snakes.  “Burning honey does not work and moth balls do not work either. The chemical in mothballs is toxic to mammals and to insects but it is harmless to snakes. I don’t know why so many people think this works – it does not,” he said. Sofranko explained that snakes do not have the sense of smell as humans and as such, do not use their sense of smell to perceive danger. “Snakes do not smell like we do. Further they do not use their sense of odor detection to warn of danger. They do not recognize a good smell or bad smell like humans and other animals do,” he said. Snakes smell through their mouths by flicking their tongues, collecting chemicals from the air or ground, which are acted upon by a pair of organs on the roof of their mouths called the Jacobson’s or vomeronasal organ. This makes it possible for snakes to follow trails left by preys or potential mates. “That means the only way the [odor] molecules can get to them is through the mouth,” says Kurt Schwenk, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Connecticut. However, Sofranko revealed that snakes can be kept away from homes and surroundings to avoid unnecessary risks to family, pets or the environment. “Other than making the area less desirable and habitable for snakes, there is no way to keep snakes away.” This includes keeping homes and surroundings clean and free of possible areas for hiding, including tall grasses, cracked or damaged walls or roofs, littering refuse and other things that can attract rodents and other snake preys. It is also important to fumigate homes and surroundings to prevent rodent and snake invasion. There is no evidence that burning paper soaked in honey can repel snakes from homes and surroundings. This purported snake repellent indeed is not harmful to snakes. ",FALSE-,08/12/2021,https://dubawa.org/is-burning-paper-soaked-in-honey-repulsive-for-snakes/
Claim: A viral Twitter screenshot claims the RCCG launched an online dating website,"The screenshot of a Twitter post by TODAY.ng, a news blog, which recently went viral on social media, especially WhatsApp, claims the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) launched an online dating website. This claim led to several reactions and comments on Twitter with some persons creating online profiles for the dating website, memes etc. A Twitter user Daniel Regha (@DanielRegha) criticised this move, saying with the high level of insecurity in Nigeria at the moment, this move by the church is not smart. He also believes people will be deceived as it will be believed that everyone on that platform would be a decent man/woman. Another user Omotara Akanni (@_theladymo) posted her own profile with a name, age and phone number.  The controversial nature of this claim prompted us to do this fact-check. Verification  Dubawa traced and found the original tweet by TODAY (@todayng) published on Thursday, December 2, 2021 at 1:37pm. This confirms the screenshot is an actual tweet that originated from TODAY. The tweet when found had garnered 819 retweets, 1,234 quote tweets and 1,422 likes. Attached to this tweet is the link to the story by TODAY. A keyword search led to the same story on TODAY’s  website with the headline “RCCG launches online dating site.” According to this report, the City of David Parish, under the leadership of pastor Idowu Iluyomade, launched an online christian dating platform for mature singles.  Other News platforms like Channels Tv, Punch etc also published this story. The news report by Channels Tv carried a different headline, “No Marriage In Heaven: RCCG Parish Opens Online Dating Site.”  The report noted that this was by the City of David parish in Victoria Island, Lagos. On the other hand, the report by Punch had the headline “RCCG parish creates dating website for Christian singles.” This report which quoted churchtimesnigeria.net as its source identified the said website address to be connectnow.com.ng. Considering the varying headlines, Dubawa visited the RCCG’s website but found nothing of that nature. We went ahead to message the call centre contact found on the website on WhatsApp which confirmed that the Lagos parish did launch a website. “Good Morning, this is true.” the reply read.  Dubawa also visited the website identified by Punch’s report and observed that signup had been disabled on the website with a message that registration for connection was now closed. Our findings and the notice at the call centre of RCCG’s website confirm a dating website was launched by one of RCCG parishes, not the entire RCCG.

False Verification: According to the IEC, all eligible voters voted with marbles/tokens. This is different from the ‘Marble’ app. The app is a digital tool developed by the election observer group, Gambia Participates, to “ease access to credible election information.” “You cannot vote with the Marble app. It is not even provided for,” Annetta Mahoney, Programme Officer at Gambia Participates told Dubawa. According to Gambia Participates, “The Marble mobile application, named for the marble stone used in elections in The Gambia since independence in 1965, is a digital tool created in 2018 to provide up-to-date, timely and accurate election information to [voters] to promote election transparency and accountability. The application is intended to be used to inform and educate people on elections in general.” Partly true  Verification: It is true that the candidates of the Independent Essa Mbye Faal, GDC Mama Kandeh, and UDP Ousainou Darboe, held a press conference to express their displeasure with the election results. What is not true is that Hon. Halifa Sallah and Abdoulie Jammeh were on their way to the meeting. Dubawa put a call through to Hon. Halifa, who says his party is an organised political party, and if they are not satisfied with the election results, they will organise their own press conference. He also added that he has not been seen on TV attending any press conference and expressed his utmost displeasure at the accusations. “Counting was done on the spot and all sides knew the results before the IEC. So if there are technicalities, they are just technicalities but the fact is already known. We are confident that those facts are incontestable and it is incontrovertible as far as we are concerned that the president-elect, Barrow, won,” False Verification: Dubawa found the video on YouTube through a Yandex search. We found one posted in 2017 by R Dee with the caption “Halifa Sallah on yaya jammeh’s speak”. PDOIS has debunked the claim. The party said the video is from 2016 and is unrelated to this year’s election. Furthermore, Jaha Dukureh, the co-chair of the Youth Interparty Committee of the PDOIS says the video is dated.  “The video is from the 2016 presidential election. Halifa Sallah did not publish any statement or video pertaining to the current occurrence,” she said. Verdict: Partly True Verification: Yes, it is true that the CSO Coalition on Election (CCE) declared the election free, fair and transparent. This was disclosed at a press conference organized by the CSO Coalition on Election at Coco Ocean Hotel. It is however false that the CCE chairman said 700 observers were deployed by the group.  “The 700 observers are inaccurate. 150 from the CSO Coalition plus 26 from the National Human Rights Commission which makes it 176. The two were sharing reports,” Lamin Jahateh, Program Manager at the Gambia Press Union and an official at the Situation room told Dubawa.

True,"True Verification: Observers at Kerewan and Bakau confirmed that some voters were prevented from voting for not wearing face masks. However, the IEC Director of Communication, Pa Makan Khan, says it has not come to his attention.  He said the wearing of face masks is a preventive measure to curb the spread of COVID-19. Polling agents are advised to enforce the measures but should not deter anyone without a face mask from their constitutional right of voting. Mostly False.  Verification: According to Amie Singhateh, a constituency supervisor at Serekunda, nothing of such happened at the polling stations under her watch. Efforts to get comments from an IEC executive on the situation have been unsuccessful as they were unavailable to confirm or deny the situation. In addition, there wasn’t a specific polling station mentioned in the post to enable us track False Verification: Sheikh Imam Abdoulah Fatty has denied the claim. “I didn’t make no such statement,” he told Dubawa. He referred us to an audio he has released debunking the viral claim. Further analysis of the shared audio post shows the voice is not that of Imam Fatty. False Verification: The Public Relations Officer (PRO) of Immigration, Mamanding S. Dibba, says the Director-General of the Gambia Immigration Department has not given such an order.  ‘‘I am not aware of any such directive issued by the DG. It is very funny news to me really,’’ he told Dubawa.  He appealed to the security officers to continue their work and strictly guard the borders. False Verification: The spokesperson of the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC), Pa Makan Khan says this is impossible.  “To fill the ballot drum, you need over 10,000 marbles. This cannot be filled because we don’t have that number at a polling centre,” he said. True  Verification: Observers at Election Watch confirmed to Dubawa that voting is still ongoing in Sukuta. According to the group, a number of voters were still in the queue at the official closing time. The Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) regulations stipulate that voters in the queue at 5:00pm must be allowed to cast their ballot. False Verification: Journalists, Yankuba Jallow and Kemi Busari, who have been at the IEC since yesterday say at no time did this happen.

Claim: Dr. Ceesay and the Citizens Alliance party have endorsed Adama Barrow for this year’s presidential elections – social media posts.,"Claim: Dr. Ceesay and the Citizens Alliance party have endorsed Adama Barrow for this year’s presidential elections – social media posts.  Both the leader, Ismaila Ceesay, and spokesperson, Menneh Gomez of the Citizen Alliance party have announced that the party maintains its non-endorsement posture.  As the leader for the Citizen Alliance party, Dr. Ismaila Ceesay is not contesting for the 2021 Gambia elections after being disqualified by the IEC, a number of claims have risen on social media concerning the endorsement of other presidential candidates by him and his party.  For example, the NPP Gambia Forward group, a group in support of the National People’s Party leader, Adama Barrow, posted on Facebook that the Kanifing Municipality Citizen Alliance’s women’s wing announced on 2 December 2021 that they had endorsed President Adama Barrow’s National People’s Party (NPP) for this year’s Presidential Elections. This is accompanied by a photo of women in Ceesay’s T-shirts standing next to NPP flagbearer Adama Barrow.  The flag bearer Dr. Ismaila Ceesay on 3 December announced on Twitter that the Citizen Alliance party remains resolute in not endorsing any of the Presidential Candidates in this year’s elections. “As Citizen Alliance Gambia maintains its non-endorsement/ alignment posture, we wish everyone a peaceful election. We send our best wishes to all the presidential candidates” the post read.  Furthermore, while the photo and the visit to Adama Barrow by some CA supporters has been confirmed to be real, the spokesperson of the Citizen Alliance party, Menneh Freda Gomez in a Facebook live session on the Citizen Alliance page, has clarified that the group of women, whom she knows personally as members of the CA party, went to extend their support to Barrow out of their personal volition and not on account of the party. She explained that there were divergent views of party members who wanted to support other presidential candidates, which was welcome by the party, however she emphasised that the group of women who went on the trip to visit Adama Barrow was not endorsed by Citizen Alliance. “We stand by what we said in the press release. We decided as a party to not endorse or go into a coalition or partnership to support any presidential candidate, and this was a result of the voice of the majority of the party” Gomez said.  Even though some members of the Citizen Alliance party have visited Adama Barrow to express their support, it was a personal and not a party-endorsed trip. The leader of the CA, Dr. Ismaila Ceesay, and the spokesperson of the CA, Menneh Freda Gomez have emphasised the non-endorsement posture of the party.

Claim: A Twitter user claims an election can be won in The Gambia even when the majority of the electorates do not vote for a candidate.,"With all eyes on the December 4 2021 election that will see six candidates contest for the presidency of the smallest West African nation of The Gambia, social media has been playing an integral role in the entire electioneering process. Young people and political parties in the country have actively been using social media platforms to contribute to debates and discussions as well as campaign to voters. Twitter is one social media platform that has been used by Gambians to communicate issues surrounding the forthcoming general elections.  In this tweet, one Twitter user claims a candidate does not need to be voted for by the majority of the populace to win an election. “Do you know you can win elections in the Gambia when the majority of the populace didn’t vote for you? This so-called single majority should be removed from our law books. It makes little sense tbh,” he tweeted. This assertion by this Twitter post provoked a series of questions in the comment section with people asking how that could be possible and others requesting that he elaborate on the statement as it made little or no sense to them.  “Eg From the 900K registered voters, party A scores 400K while the 500K is shared by the other parties 5, it means party A wins even though the majority of the voters didn’t vote for it,” was the claimant’s response.  First, it must be noted that per the constitution of The Gambia Part V Section 39(1) and The Gambia Elections Act, Chapter 3:01, only registered voters, not the entire populace, are eligible to vote to elect a president. Section 81 of The Gambia Elections Act, Chapter 3:01, Decree No.78 of 1996, specifies that the candidate with the greatest number of votes is the elected candidate. “The commission shall as soon as practicable on receipt of election results declare the results and elect the candidate, or in the case of a list of candidates the number on the list in accordance to section 79 (equal number of votes), who received the greatest number of votes.” The simple majority also referred to as the first-past-the-post system, is an electoral system that allows a candidate who scored the highest number of votes among candidates in an election to be declared winner. The winner does not need to score the majority of the votes cast. Whilst it may not require the overall majority of the votes cast in an election or a winning percentage, it lays premium and emphasis on the candidate scoring the highest number of votes amongst other candidates. The system is practised by some other countries around the world like Malawi and The United States. The simple majority indicates that one candidate must have obtained the most votes than any other candidate did individually in an election. In December 2016, Gambians went to the poll to cast their votes in an election that ousted the authoritarian reign of former President Yayah Jammeh, which spanned over two decades. This created the space for a democratic transition that brought opposition leader Adama Barrow to power with the United Democratic Party (UDP) party. President Adama Barrow scored a total of 227, 708 votes while Jammeh had 208, 847 votes and the third candidate, Mama Kandeh, securing 89,769 total votes cast as seen in the official results by the Independent Electoral Commission. While President Barrow’s 227,708 scored 43% of the total votes cast in his favour, he won because he secured more votes than his competitors. The simple majority system also referred to as the plurality system makes it possible for a candidate who receives the highest number of votes amongst other candidates to be declared winner. It is, therefore, true that one can win an election in The Gambia when the majority of the population did not vote for you but secured more votes than each of the other candidates that aspired, as mandated by the simple majority system.

Claim: There is a popular notion in many parts of the world that it is unusual for a child to grow their upper teeth first.,"The primary teeth of babies, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics, usually appear at six or seven months old. And Colleen de Bellefonds, an expert in pregnancy, health and nutrition reports that, an average first baby tooth emerges at 6 or 7 months, but sometimes these may appear at around 12 months (or even later).  Some babies get their first teeth very early, at around three or four months old. Normally, the bottom front teeth (also known as central incisors) appear first. Sometimes, this ‘normal pattern’ of teeth growth is reversed, as the upper front teeth come first. This article examines some beliefs about a baby’s first upper front teeth and what the fact is. The human teeth, those hard, resistant structures occurring on the jaws and in the mouth, are used for catching and masticating food, for defence, and for other special purposes.  According to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the first set of teeth are called primary teeth while the second set are called permanent ones. Humans have 20 primary and 32 permanent teeth. Tooth eruption occurs when the teeth become visible. While tooth eruption occurs at different times for different people, a general eruption timeline exists. According to this timeline, dentition starts with the appearance of the bottom teeth known as the central incisors between 6 to 10 months  and lasts until six or seven years when the teeth are shed. From the foregoing, it is safe to deduce that the lower teeth appear first in human beings. However, in some cases, the upper teeth appear first in some children. Some people believe that when a baby gets upper teeth first, he or she will grow up to become a prophet. These babies are usually treated with reverence. When such children grow up, it is believed that whatever they say will come to pass. In other words, parents of such babies tenderly handle them and try not to make them angry, even during their formative years. Due to the belief by parents that such children’s tongues have special powers, such children are raised to learn to be careful about the words they utter and the things they wish for themselves or for others. While there are different time frames and patterns for babies’ growth milestones from teeth growth to walking, babies differ and some babies may not follow the pattern that most people have grown up to accept as normal. Baby’s teeth may erupt in a different pattern than what’s considered the normal pattern. For instance, a child’s front upper teeth may erupt first and this is considered abnormal in many Nigerian cultures.  This phenomenon has attained the status of a myth, and children with such conditions are labelled weird or spirit beings. Families with such babies tend to hide them from the public eye.  According to an article by Pulse on teeth myths, the frost of a baby’s upper first teeth is believed to mean that the child has got prophetic powers.  ‘Some people believe that a child that grows the upper tooth first will grow up to become a prophet. These babies are usually treated with reverence. When such a child grows up, it is believed whatever they say will come to pass‘, part of the article reads. The article quickly dismissed this as a myth, stating that even though mothers could get worried, it is equally normal. Image of the Upper Front Teeth first appearing. Photo Credit: www.lupinepublishers.com  Dr Gbemisola Boyede, a developmental and community paediatrician and member of the Swansea University Health Boardalso, insists in the article, Dispelling the Baby Upper Teeth First Myth Eleyin Oke, that although ‘many cultures attribute different meanings to this condition as being a good or bad omen, it is only a myth. For her, even though developing the upper teeth first seems abnormal, and its exact cause is still unknown, it might be a pointer to other undiscovered underlying medical conditions that may require thorough medical examinations. Dr Gbemisola Boyede, however, says that the teeth must not be removed by force. This myth about upper teeth first appearance is not specific to Africa alone.  In some parts of India, the myth is also peddled by people. In an article, Baby Teething Myths and Misconceptions that Parents Should Know, it is thought to bring bad luck to families.  However, Julie Adeboye, a blogger and freelance writer, quoting the  National Health Service in the UK, writes that it is merely a myth, and should not be a source of worry for mothers when their baby’s top teeth grow first. Also, a foundation of pediatricians dismisses the claim as a myth that has no scientific backing, especially the belief that such babies are witches or wizards with extraordinary powers.  Image of the human teeth. Photo Credit: @AbrahamAkinbami. This researcher contacted oral health professionals and dental surgeons to get more information on the matter. Dr Abraham Akinbami, a dental surgeon, said there is really no serious implication if the upper set of teeth comes out before the lower. ‘The only thing that we do is just to take x-rays to make sure that the lower set of teeth are close by and about to come out, so, there is no hide and fast rule about it’, he said. Dr Akinbami insists that there is no spiritual indication for the upper teeth appearing first in children, and that it is just a biological phenomenon.  ‘No, nothing spiritual, nothing supernatural, the child is not a superhuman. The body just decided that, it happens, like I said, it is a variation, so, it may be one in 100, or one in a thousand. I don’t have the correct figures, but if it happens, it happens. There’s nothing supernatural or spiritual about it,’ he added. In case a child grows the upper teeth first, Dr Akinbami cautions against removing the teeth, and urges parents to seek medical counsel:  ‘So, if this goes out, and the person is still not convinced, just go to the dentist, just take your baby to the dentist and lodge your complaints. But, please, do not attempt to remove the tooth yourself’, Dr Akinbami noted.  Another dental surgeon, Oluwayemisi Ikumelo, said what seems normal may differ because every individual is genetically peculiar. Dr Ikumelo  added that when the upper front teeth erupt first, it may not be something out of the blue. However, investigations can reveal if there are factors that may have caused the delay of the lower set. In the same vein, Dr Adesola Odofin said that, although the Yoruba people in Nigeria believe that it’s abnormal, there is nothing abnormal about it. She added that if the upper teeth appear first, there must be no attempt to remove them. She also debunked the myth that children born with upper teeth first are spiritual.  ‘If the child brings up the upper teeth first, then, so be it, there is nothing wrong about it. We have the myth of “eleyin oke” that whatever the child says comes to pass. Those are just myths, they are not true, it doesn’t happen like that. Such teeth should not be removed because there won’t be any replacement for them until it is time for the permanent teeth to come out,” she said. There is sufficient evidence from reviewed articles and several oral health and dental surgeons consulted that there is nothing unusual or spiritual about the upper teeth erupting first in children. The idea is a myth that has been debunked by medicine. ",FALSE,03/12/2021,https://dubawa.org/debunking-the-myth-about-childrens-unusual-growth-of-first-teeth-in-upper-jaw/
Claim: A message currently circulating on Whatsapp claims that bitter kola is a snake repellent and snake venom neutralizer.,"Recently, a Nigerian Air Force (NAF) personnel attached to the Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA), Lance Corporal Ogah Bercy, was reported to have died of complications from a snakebite in her toilet on 19 November 2021, at the NAF base Bill Clinton Drive, Abuja. Reports said the snake is suspected to have found its way into her home through the septic tank to the waste dislodger, then made its way into her toilet bowl (WC) and bit her when she sat on the toilet seat in her room. Although Bercy was rushed to the medical center, she didn’t survive. Following the event, various recommendations on remedies to either prevent or cure snake bites began to surface on social media. One of them is one that urged Nigerians to either use salt or a mixture of kerosene and salt to flush toilets for the eradication of reptiles and to use sodium hypochlorite in toilets because it can effectively kill snakes.   Screenshot of WhatsApp claim Another claim surfaced on WhatsApp, urging Nigerians to ignore the kerosene and salt mixture message, claiming that snakes can’t live inside soakaway. Then another  Whatsapp message urged Nigerians to drink and eat bitter kola, with the message that bitter kola can neutralize snake venom. “If the snake bite or scopion bite just eat one bitter cola and the snake poison and scopion poison will neutralize within few minute of eating it. You use bitter cola to keep snake away from your home. Get dried bitter cola grind it to powder apply the powder to the floor of your house. If any snake crosses it, it will die instantly. Children at home can accidentally eat poisonous things like eating bar soap or powedered soap” the claim said.  Screenshot of the second Whatsapp message Dubawa decided to verify the credibility of the claims.  Garcinia kola is also known as bitter kola is a sharp seed, eaten raw with a bitter flavor that eases into a slight sweetness. A word search showed that the claim was retrieved from a Facebook post in 2018.  A Facebook user Sure truth posted the claim that garnered 29, 254 shares and over 6000 comments, on 26 October 2018. Dubawa noticed that while the post was generating positive feedback some users questioned its credibility.  Like Zaidau S Umar queried, “I know it’s does a lot of good,but that venom, I doubt. Snake venoms act differently, so there is no single anti venom that works for all”. The same way Seh Vuntin Ten sarcastically said, “I will try this… Next I see a snake I will try to touch it and eat bitter kola to know if it will work”. A background check revealed that Sure truth claims to be a herbalist who gives natural home remedies. Cleveland clinic website, an hospital known for research, coronary artery bypass surgery and the first face transplant in the United States, noted that there are two major types of venomous snakes which include: The clinic went on to advise that it is important to seek immediate medical attention because the ultimate treatment for a snake bite is antivenom. But while waiting for medical attention, victims are asked to take these precautionary measures: Knowing the size, color, and shape of the snake can help the doctor determine which antivenom is best for that particular situation. A quick check revealed that antivenoms are created by immunizing horses or sheep with the venom of a particular snake. Their blood serum (the watery part of the blood) is then processed, as it will contain antibodies capable of neutralizing the effects of the venom.  Some antivenoms treat bites from a specific type of snake (monospecific antivenoms) and also those that treat bites from a number of snakes found in a particular geographic region (polyspecific antivenoms). Dubawa went on to contact a conservation biologist/ ornithologist, Mrs. Nanchin Winifred Kazeh, who said science has proven that bitter kola is an effective snake repellent but it doesn’t kill them.  Kazeh said, “Sure the remedy is very effective as proven by scientific research. The use of bitter kola as snake repellent has proven to be an effective eco-friendly method. Is a win-win for conservation as none of the snakes are killed in the process. The smell from the kola repel snakes from a radius of a mile away” The ornithologist however said science is yet to prove whether the smell of the bitter kola can repel all snake species. “But the mixture of salt and kerosene has not been scientifically proven as snake repellent” Kaze added. While advising people to properly seal soakaways, septic tanks, inspection chambers, and manholes, she also affirmed that snakes can truly slip into broken soakaways to look for rats. Verification has proven that there is no scientific evidence to support the effectiveness of bitter kola as antivenom. Even though science has proven that bitter kola is an effective snake repellent from a radius of a mile away. Snakebite victims are advised to seek immediate medical attention.

Claim: A Facebook user claimed that a notorious kidnapper popularly known as Evans has been sentenced to death by the court.,"A popular social media personality Ayo Ojeniyi, shared in a Facebook post a video wherein it was claimed that a kidnap kingpin, Chukwudumeme Onwuamadike, popularly known as Evans, has been sentenced to death. The politics and current affairs commentator shared the video on Thursday, November 25, as conversations continue to heighten on the rise in kidnapping and general insecurity across the country. Ojeniyi, who wrote with conviction, noted that there is a possibility of Evans appealing the verdict, which “may take another  3 years to conclude.” “At last,  Evans sentenced to death. Sure, he will appeal. But I am sure both the Appeal and Supreme Courts will confirm the sentence  !!! It may take another  3 years to conclude. We are watching ooo,” he said in a post that garnered over 200 shares and numerous comments. A check on the comments on the post showed that many of Ojeniyi’s Facebook friends truly believed Evans’ death sentence.   Dubawa discovered that this is not the first time news or video of Evans being sentenced to death would surface on the internet. In 2020, numerous platforms including a blog tmnewsonline and a Youtube channel NollyconnectTV reported that the kidnapper was sentenced to death by a High Court sitting in Lagos. Fact-check by some media platforms showed that the claim is false and misleading. Born Chukwudi Onuamadike in Nnewi Anambra State, Evans, also known as “billionaire kidnapper” was arrested in Lagos state in June 2017 by the operatives of the Nigerian Police Force (NPF). Before his arrest, the “most wanted, vicious and highly notorious” kidnapper had been linked with several high-profile kidnapping cases in the country, with his victims including foreign nationals, traditional chiefs and wealthy businessmen. Police report established that Evans usually operated with two separate gangs to conduct kidnappings: one to carry out the abduction and another to transfer the victim to a safe house.  In August 2017, he was arraigned before a judge of the Ikeja High Court on a two-count charge of conspiracy and kidnapping alongside five others: Uche Amadi, Ogechi Uchechukwu, Chilaka Ifeanyi, Okwuchukwu Nwachukwu and Victor Aduba over the alleged kidnap of Donatus Dunu, chief executive officer of Maydon Pharmaceutical Ltd. He pleaded guilty to the offence and was remanded at Kirikiri Maximum Prison by the court with trial facing myriad adjournments since then. On January 22, 2021, the notorious kidnapper who is a first defendant in the case made a U-turn and denied bearing Evans as his nickname, saying he is just a businessman forced by the police to sign “confession.” Justice Oluwatoyin Taiwo of an Ikeja Special Offences Court in March 2021, gave the prosecution in the trial of Evans a “last chance to put its house in order”  as the case continues to be delayed. Evans’ last appearance in court was in June 2021 when his trial was stalled because his lawyer said the kidnapper’s witness “could no longer be reached via phone.” Verifying the claim, Dubawa ran a Google search for the latest development on Evans’ trial, but no credible media has a report about his “sentence.” The only recent report on his case (June 2021) was about the trial being stalled. According to his lawyer, Oyekunle Falabi, a prominent witness whose name was not given could not be reached via phone. “My lord, ordinarily we are ready to go on, but I’m surprised that the first defendant’s (Evans) witness is not in court. My lord, we have even put her through as a witness and I am surprised that she is not here. I have been trying to reach her on the phone but her line is switched off. I am praying that the court should give us a short date,” Evans’ counsel told Justice Hakeem Oshodi as reported by the  News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) as seen in Premium Times. A related report (November 2021) by NAN, which was published by The Guardian Newspaper, was when one of the co-defendants in the Evans case, Joseph Emeka, told Justice Oluwatoyin Taiwo of the Ikeja Special Offences Court that he was “losing his sight.” Dubawa’s findings also established that the video being shared on social media to mislead people on Evans’ trial and the claim that Evans has been sentenced to death was extracted from a video interview with the billionaire kidnapper by Channels TV which was uploaded on their Youtube channel on June 15, 2017. When contacted, a staff of the Lagos High Court who simply identified himself as Mr Nofiu said the case is still ongoing in the court of law.   “It’s a rumour on social media, as you rightly said. Just discard it,” he said. There is no evidence or credible official report that the notorious billionaire kidnapper, Evans, has been sentenced to death by hanging by the Federal High Court in Lagos.

Claim: A viral message surfaced on WhatsApp urging Nigerians to put a mixture of salt and garlic in the corners of their rooms to eradicate wall gecko. The warning was followed by a story that a wall gecko fell into a pot of soup prepared by a housewife in Nigeria unknown to her and it killed the woman and her 9 children after eating the soup.,"A viral message surfaced on WhatsApp urging Nigerians to put a mixture of salt and garlic in the corners of their rooms to eradicate wall gecko, with the story that a  wall gecko fell into a pot of soup prepared by a housewife in Nigeria unknown to her and killed the woman and her nine children after eating the soup. It reads, “Slippery House Lizard known as Wall Gecko also called Omonle in Yoruba fell into a pot of soup prepared by a housewife in Nigeria unknowingly and it killed the woman and her 9 children after eating. “Another woman who prepared Tea in a kettle which the gecko fell into, all the family that drank the tea died. “Please ensure your food, cooked or raw is tightly closed as this animal is highly poisonous, it also goes with “aljanus” (jinns) – verifiable. Therefore do everything possible to get rid of this dangerous animal from your home.” The claim particularly notes that “the reptile goes with jinns and it’s highly poisonous and it is verifiable.” Dubawa opted to verify the authenticity of this claim. A keyword search revealed that the claim has been in circulation since 2017, as a news item in Nigeria, the Sun Newspaper categorically alerted Nigerians to kill wall geckos because investigation has shown that the reptile is harmful. The newspaper warned vividly: “Ordinarily, the skin of the gecko is highly poisonous…To eradicate it in your home, just mix salt and garlic and put mixture in different corners of your room. You will never see them again.” A response on 9 May 2018 from Udonsi Eke on Nature Cures Initiative Facebook post questioned the credibility of the claim “But I remember eating a wall gecko that was roasted just to make me stop bedwetting in my childhood days. So is this information true?” Animal diversity website describes a wall gecko as a tree-living terrestrial species, living in human-populated areas. A reptile that originated from Southeast Asia but is currently found almost everywhere across the globe. It says wall geckos occur on buildings, mostly near artificial lighting because they are nocturnal insectivores.  With the simple description of this uninvolved reptile that feeds mainly on insects, Dubawa felt the urge to get the thought of an expert, Mrs. Emudiare Tailobi, a zoologist from the University of Jos. “Wall geckos aren’t venomous, that’s a fact,” Mrs. Emudiare said over the phone, adding that although they can carry some harmful bacteria in their mouths that are detrimental to human health, the reptile is naturally harmless. Mrs. Tialobi explained that “Wall geckos are not toxic, but they may have picked up harmful bacterias that in large amounts can cause harm to humans.” Dubawa went further to get more insight from  a biologist, Mrs. Nanchin Winifred Kazeh from Leventis Ornithological Research Institute (APLORI) Jos-east Laminga via WhatsApp, and she affirmed that wall geckos are not poisonous A conversation with a biologist/ornithologist, Nanchin Winifred Kazeh of A. P. Leventis Ornithological Research Institute (APLORI), Jos-east on WhatsApp revealed that the smell of garlic and salt mixture wards off wall geckos.  Mrs. Kazeh said that wall geckos feed on insects such as lizards, nectars, and spiders. And since light attracts insects, wall geckos are found on buildings with artificial lighting, as it helps them spot their prey easily.  “The wall geckos play a very important role in balancing the ecosystem.  Yes, their appearance scares most people, but all the protective measures put up by humans only aid the reptile to adapt well to the environment. Wall geckos are important and useful to humans,” Kazeh added. While urging Nigerians to dismiss outrageous claims, and instead learn to read properly, know the source, and ask appropriate questions, the ornithologist outlined two fun facts which include: 1. Did you know that natural or human disturbances have resulted in more eggs being laid by the wall geckos? Implication; the more we disturb them with our garlic and salt mixtures and try to kill them, the more they multiply 2. Did you know that female wall geckos can store sperm for up to a year? This is a trait that likely aids the species’ transportability and invasion success. Verification has shown that wall geckos are not poisonous as contained in a viral WhatsApp message; instead, they play an important role in balancing the ecosystem. Even though the garlic and salt mixture can scare wall geckos, it will only increase its production.

"Claim: A viral screenshot claims the minister of humanitarian affairs, Sadiya Farouk, said the government’s cash transfer policy is only for the North as there are no poor persons in Southern Nigeria.","The National Cash Transfer Office (NCTO) under the Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, is the intervention arm of the National Social Safety Nets Project (NASSP) which facilitates cash transfers for capacity building of beneficiaries. The NCTO through the Household Uplifting Programme provides support for poor and vulnerable citizens through targeted cash transfers for capacity building, coaching and mentoring, and livelihood support. Recently, the screenshot of a Twitter post claims that the minister of Humanitarian affairs, Sadiya Farouk, said that there are no poor people in the southern part of Nigeria which is why they are not sharing money to that region.  “We are only sharing money to the poorest Nigerians in the North because we don’t have poor people in Southern Nigeria, they have people outside the country that is taking care of them so we are not going to South Nigeria” the viral Twitter screenshot read. According to this screenshot, which showed no source (i.e which Twitter user made the post), the post was shared on Saturday, November 27, 2021. The claim surfaced following the federal government’s recent decision to remove fuel subsidy by 2022 and replace it with N5,000 monthly transportation grant to poor Nigerians. Dubawa first observed the Minister’s name in the viral screenshot was not properly spelt. Farouq was spelt as Farouk which is a red flag.  Dubawa tried to trace the Twitter post and found a post by Baasegun Alabe (@baasegun) with the caption “this is what these boldface thieves call one Nigeria”.  Dubawa therefore tried to find out if the minister actually said this but found no record of the statement. Also, according to the NCTO website, its mandate is to deliver the targeted cash transfer across the country. Our search also led to a fact-check by the Centre for Democracy and Development (CDD) in April 2020, which debunked the claim. According to this check, the claim was circulating on Instagram at the time, which shows this is a recirculated claim.  The National Bureau of statistics (NBS) data on poverty and inequality in 2019 shows that poverty level cuts across different regions in the country.  This counters the claim that southern Nigeria does not have poor people. Also a report by Premium Times noted that in August 2021, the federal government recommenced the conditional cash transfer from which over 6,000 Lagosians had benefited, according to Lagos State Commissioner for Wealth Creation and Employment, Yetunde Arobieke. This further discredits the claim as Lagos is in the South Western region of Nigeria. Our findings show this statement is a recirculated claim from 2020 and was not made by the minister. Also, NCTO’s website notes that its mandate cuts across the country, not restricted to the North.

Claim: A public announcement claims that the National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA)  in collaboration with Development Partners will ramp up COVID-19 mass vaccination across the country.,"A public announcement making the rounds on social media platforms  claims the National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA) in collaboration with Development Partners will engage some ad hoc personnel for mass vaccination across the country.  The message urged all qualified Nigerians to apply as ad hoc ‘vaccinators,’ recorders and validators who must be health workers licensed to administer injections.  The message further stated that the minimum qualification for recorders and validators is post secondary school education and only applicants who have received at least one dose of COVID-19 will be considered. On WhatsApp, where the message was also shared, multiple users doubted the credibility of the news. One user in a group commented, “please stop sharing this kind of information here. It is fake. Do we also need to tell you?”  This is not the first time Dubawa has debunked alleged job announcements offered by government agencies. At the height of the COVID-19 lockdown in 2020, multiple job opportunities misled members of the public into falling victims of ponzi schemes. As such, Dubawa opted to verify the claim. When Dubawa reached out to the head of communications, NPHCDA, Muhammad Onitoto, he confirmed that the public service announcement to engage ad hoc personnel for mass vaccination campaign is true. “Yes, it is true. NPHCDA is set to undertake a mass vaccination campaign across the countries. The opportunity is open for all those who are qualified,” Mr Onitoto said in a phone conversation. Even more, the job opportunity was shared on the NPHCA’s website, encouraging those qualified to apply and be part of the campaign.

Claim: A Twitter User Femi (@Obaluaye_) claimed that smoked or grilled food contains mutagenic chemicals and cancerous agents that can cause colorectal cancer and damage to the liver and kidney.,"Claim: A Twitter User Femi (@Obaluaye_) claimed that smoked or grilled food contains mutagenic chemicals and cancerous agents that can cause colorectal cancer and damage to the liver and kidney. There is a causal relationship between grilled or smoked food and colorectal cancer, however, it all depends on the level of one’s consumption. The claim is therefore partially true. On November 15, 2021, a Twitter user Femi (@Obaluaye_) claimed that smoked or grilled food contains heterocyclic aromatic amines and other carcinogenic agents that cause colorectal cancer, damage the kidney, damage liver and eventually kill the person. The post as at November 23, 2021 has garnered over 13.2 thousand likes and 5, 280 comments. The smoking and grilling of meat, fish and poultry has become increasingly popular as a food preparation method. Historically, the smoking of meat dates back to when people first lived in caves. It was one of the first food preparation techniques. Fish and meat are a kind of perishable product and if it is not sold or consumed fresh, proper preservation techniques have to be applied to extend its shelf life. And the preservation methods include freezing, drying -sun drying or oven drying, fermentation, heat treatment and smoking. With the irregular electricity power supply in Nigeria, it has been observed that most people turn to smoking or grilling to preserve their food or sometimes to cook them. Also, smoking or grilling is not only done as a preservative which is the original purpose but also done for the unique taste and flavour conveyed by the smoking method in recent times. So, is the claim that smoked or grilled food contains heterocyclic aromatic amines and other carcinogenic agents that cause colorectal cancer, damage the kidney, damage liver and eventually kills the person true? According to the National Cancer Institute, Heterocyclic amines (HCAs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are chemicals formed when muscle meat, including beef, pork, fish, or poultry, is cooked using high-temperature methods, such as pan frying or grilling directly over an open flame. In laboratory experiments, HCAs and PAHs have been found to be mutagenic i.e, they cause changes in DNA that may increase the risk of cancer. HCAs are formed when amino acids (the building blocks of proteins), sugars, and creatine or creatinine (substances found in muscle) react at high temperatures. PAHs are formed when fat and juices from meat grilled directly over a heated surface or open fire drip onto the surface or fire, causing flames and smoke. The smoke contains PAHs that then adhere to the surface of the meat. PAHs can also be formed during other food preparation processes, such as smoking of meats. The formation of HCAs and PAHs varies by meat type, cooking method, and range level (rare, medium, or well done). Whatever the type of meat, however, meats cooked at high temperatures, especially above 300 ºF (as in grilling or pan frying), or that are cooked for a long time tend to form more HCAs. For example, well-done, grilled, or barbecued chicken and steak all have high concentrations of HCAs. Cooking methods that expose meat to smoke contribute to PAH formation. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), colorectal cancer is cancer that occurs in the colon or rectum. Sometimes it is called colon cancer, for short. The colon is the large intestine or large bowel. The rectum is the passageway that connects the colon to the anus. Sometimes abnormal growths, called polyps, form in the colon or rectum. Over time, some polyps may turn into cancer.  A consultant oncologist, Dr Okereke Chukwuma, said cooking meat at high temperatures by grilling or frying could potentially elevate the risk of colorectal cancer, but a definite conclusion on this is still up for debate. He said; “It is true but the person has to be exposed to eating such foods for a long time, and that is not the case in Nigeria. Basically, there is some truth in that claim, but things that have to do with medicine don’t have a straight yes or no answer. When we speak of smoked food for example, there is a strong association between smoked products and cancer of the stomach. Red meat generally-smoked or cooked increases the risk of colon cancer. However, this is in the case of prolonged consumption over a long time.” He added that although the claim is true, it is still subject to further evaluation. The Director of the Center for Integrated Research in Cancer and Lifestyle at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, Dr. Stephen Freedland, in an article reveals that there is inconsistent data linking the consumption of grilled or smoked meat to cancer. “Although there is increasing evidence tying the consumption of processed meats, such as hot dogs, with some of the same cancer studies that have been linked to grilled or well-done meat, it may be that individuals who eat a lot of charred steak or well-done burgers are also more likely than the average person to eat a lot of bacon or hot dogs. And so, it could be the processed meat—not the blackened steak—those accounts for any increased cancer risks. Sorting out what’s driving these associations is very hard.’ In another article published by Moffitt Cancer Center, An Epidemiologist, Dr Kathleen Egan, said there is convincing evidence of an association between colorectal cancer risk and higher intakes of red meat, whether grilled or smoked. “Processed red meats, such as ham, sausages, bacon and hot dogs, undergo treatments like curing, smoking or the use of chemical preservatives and additives to improve shelf life and taste. The problem is those processes introduce N-nitroso compounds, which some studies have found to be linked to cancer risk,” she said. A study by some researchers revealed that foods containing a significant quantity of red or preserved meats could increase the risk of various cancers, including colorectal cancer. This can be due to a combination of factors such as the content of fat, protein, iron, and/or meat preparation. It further added that red meat may be associated with colorectal cancer by contributing to N-nitroso compound (NOC) exposure. This is just as another study does not show evidence of increased cancer risk among people who eat a lot of grilled meat. The study further reveals that there is an enhanced association between smoking and colorectal cancer risk which supports a role for NAT2 and tobacco smoke heterocyclic amines in the etiology of colorectal cancer However, the study only provides weak support for a similar association with meat heterocyclic amines. There is a causal relationship between grilled or smoked food and colorectal cancer; however, it all depends on the level of one’s consumption. Eating grilled or smoked food frequently is probably unwise if one is worried about cancer. But experts say enjoying it occasionally  isn’t something one should stress about.

Claim: A national newspaper and multiple online platforms claim Brazil has adopted Yoruba as its official language and that the language would be included in primary and secondary schools curriculum.,"A national newspaper and several online platforms, in a similar article which has been shared by many social media users, claimed the Yoruba language has been adopted by Brazil as its official language. It was stated further that the government has introduced the compulsory study of African History and Yoruba language in Brazil’s primary and secondary schools. The article was credited to a statement purportedly made by the Brazilian minister of culture, Dr Sérgio Sá leitão. On Friday, November 12, Independent Newspaper published the article with the headline “Yoruba Language Goes Global As It’s Now Compulsory In Brazilian Primary, Secondary Schools.” EaglesForeSight, an online medium, published the article on November 11 with the headline “Breaking: Brazil Adopts Yoruba Speaking As The Country Official Language.” Another online platform, AkedeOyo, published the article on November 13 with the headline,“Brazil Adopts Yoruba As Its Country Official Speaking Language.” According to these articles, the minister who was said to have given a speech at the University of Sao Paulo said: “The inclusion of African History and Yoruba Language in the curriculum would help bring the closeness of the African Brazilian people to their roots and thus encourage the understandings of the language among other important languages in Brazil apart from Portuguese which is the official language.” Findings by Dubawa revealed that several other online platforms published this article and many social media users have reshared the claim. Dubawa first noticed that the articles shared by these online platforms are the same with the majority claiming the information was passed to them in an exclusive interview with “the Brazilian minister of culture, Dr Sérgio Sá leitão, at the weekend in Brazil.” Dubawa then conducted a Google search and found that the information is not new and has been circulated several times since 2018 by several online platforms, as seen here. In 2019, the AFP Fact Check, carried out a report when the claim resurfaced. In the report, Dr Sérgio Sá leitão was addressed as a former minister of culture.  Dubawa searched further to know why that is so and found that the ministry of culture was dissolved in January 2019 by the president, Jair Bolsonaro. According to the report by AFP, a spokesman for Brazil’s special secretary for culture said the former minister had not made such a statement. “This news item is false,” he said. To further verify this claim, Dubawa reached out to Brazil’s foreign relations ministry via its website but it is still awaiting a response.  A Brazilian journalist, Pedro Kutney, said Yoruba was never an official language in Brazil and the only official language is Portuguese. He further explained that “Brazil is one of the countries which received more African black slaves in the world, about 5.8 million of the 12.5 million ‘trafficked’ from Africa to the Americas. In Brazil black slavery stands from 1535 to 1888, and of course a lot of culture was brought to the country by Africans. One of these is the afro-religions and the Yoruba language in its rituals.  “Especially in Bahia, the Brazilian “blackest” state today, many people use Yoruba words and ‘Candomblé’ religious leaders speak in Yoruba during the rituals.  “So, Yoruba is part of the historical and cultural heritage of Brazil; it is recognised by law in two large Brazilian cities, Rio de Janeiro and Salvador but was never an official language in Brazil.” Another journalist, Kaíke Nanne, described the claim as “fake news.” “This is a fake news. There is no possibility that Yoruba can replace Portuguese as the official language. Yoruba is spoken by very few black communities and has some words used in Candomblé cults. It’s just that,” he said. Portuguese is the official and national language of Brazil and it’s also the most widely spoken language in the country. According to world population review, there are about 228 languages spoken in Brazil which include Portuguese and 11 other foreign or immigrant languages and 217 indigenous languages. The claim that Brazil has adopted Yoruba as its official language and that the language will be included in primary and secondary schools curriculum is false. The content of the article published by these online platforms is not new and has been recirculated several times in the past.

"Claim: Following the emergence of 25-year-old Muhammad Sulaiman as People’s Democratic Party (PDP), National Youth Leader, some facebook users claim his deputy, Timothy Osadolo, is 60-year-old.","On October 31, 2021, Nigeria’s media space – both social and conventional – went agog with reports that Muhammed Suleiman, a 25-year-old, has emerged as the national youth leader of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Suleiman who hails from Kaduna State polled 3,072 votes at the PDP national convention while his challenger, Usman Elkudan, scored 219 votes. Suleiman is barely two years older than the PDP which itself was established in 1998. Following the victory, some social media users began to mock the victory with spurious claims, suggesting that it amounts to nothing in youth leadership since his deputy is 60-year-old. Others said he was 55.  This Facebook user for instance posted, “Youth Leader – 25 years old Deputy Youth Leader – 60 years old,” and another user posted, “National Youth Leader of that Political Party is Prince Muhd Kadade Suleiman and he’s 25. Deputy National Youth Leader is Timothy Osadolor and he’s 55 years according to reports. They won’t tell you about the Deputy. They’re only ejeculating (sic) about Suleiman…All fake! Hypocrites!!!.”  Emergence of Youth Leadership in Nigerian Politics  With nearly 70% of Nigeria’s population below the age of 35, the clamour for young people to be represented in the country’s political systems has lately remained a vital subject of discussion in the polity.  Consequently, youth participation in politics and their roles in government have gained traction amongst Nigerian youths in the last two decades. Discussing this subject at a well-attended lecture at the University of Texas at Austin on February 9, under the title, “Youth, Politics, and the Future of Nigeria,” Ololade Bamidele, an active member of the Nigerian civil society, a successful career journalist, and currently the secretary to the Editorial Board of Premium Times (the digital news media), commented on the socio-political and economic circumstances of the Nigerian youth, which, he explained, produced the “Not Too Young To Run” (NTYTR) and #EndSARS movements, two of the more recent expressions of youth frustration  the status-quo in Nigeria. In May 2018, Nigeria passed a new law which lowered the age limits for political office from 35 to 30 years in the Senate, and 30 to 25 years in the House of Representatives and State House of Assembly. Known as the “Not Too Young to Run” bill, the move was intended to reflect the changing demographics of Africa’s most populous nation and help to usher in younger leaders.  Across various levels of politics, the youths have continued to clamour and act towards the realisation of the “Not Too Young to Run” vision but despite certain limiting barriers, feelers are that more needs to be done by the youths in relation to emerging on the National Scene.  That was why soon after the historic convention of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), Nigerians expressed mixed feelings with the fact that a 25-year-old has just emerged as the National Youth Leader of the party. The reason is not far-fetched. Over the years, both the PDP and the APC have formed a habit of choosing individuals too old to be characterized as youths as National Youth Leaders. The developments have rekindled the hope of many young Nigerians, most of whom have expressed excitement even across party divides.  Prince Muhammad Kadede Sulaiman, 25, is the newly elected National Youth Leader of the PDP. He was born in 1996 at Nasarawan Doya of Makarfi local government in Kaduna State. He had his primary education at Nasarawan Doya before he proceeded to Nigerian Turkish International College for his secondary education. Kadade was admitted into Kaduna State University to study Sociology in the 2015/2016 session but was reportedly withdrawn on academic grounds. In an interview with BBC Hausa, Kadade stated that he is currently studying political science in an unnamed university. On his Facebook profile, he wrote that he came from a royal family of Nasarawan Doya at Makarfi local government. He is the grandson of Sarkin Nasarawan Doya and son of late Dan Malikin Zazzau Dalhatu Kadade Suleiman. Muhammad started politics at a young age in his zeal to contribute to the development of the society and the advancement of young people, as he stated in an interview with Voice of America’s Nasiru Adamu Elhikaya. He was a grassroots mobilizer and has been actively involved in politics since 2011. In 2019, Kadade aspired for the governorship of Kaduna State under the platform of Peoples Democratic Party. Timothy Osadolo  is the newly elected Deputy National Youth Leader of the PDP and he hails from OHE in Isi clan of Uhunmwode Local Government Area of Edo State.  Born on May 23,1985 to Mr Christopher and Mrs Vero Osadolo, both of Isi clan and seasoned educationists.  Timothy Osadolo attended, Aguebor Primary School, Egba; Egba Grammar School, Egba, and Ambrose Alli University, Ekpoma, where he obtained a BSc. Industrial Chemistry in 2007 and later an MSc. Policy and Strategic Studies in 2013.  Honorable Osadolo served as Special Adviser to the then Commissioner for Education, Hon Ekpenisi Omorotionmwan, from 2011 to 2013. He then contested and won as Councilor of Isi North, ward 7 of Uhunmwode Local Government area. As a councilor, he was chairman for both the Peace, Security and Information committees and was also the Deputy Chief Whip.  In 2017, he was elected as  the State Auditor in the All Progressives Congress (APC), Edo State. A position he held until December 9, 2019 when he resigned and decamped to the PDP.  Honorable Osadolo is a family man. He is married to Mrs. Uwazeme Osadolo with three children. He is the CEO of IESEOSA FARMS located in Isi land. Upon coming across the claim, this fact-checker conducted a facebook search with the keyword, “PDP Deputy National Youth Leader,” but there were many users with similar names.  However, search results revealed a pattern of congratulatory messages and keyword related search terms all linked to the Facebook profile of a certain Elder Tim Osa Osadolo (Osadolo Osarumwense).  A close examination of the profile timeline revealed certain political activities including at least two very recent press statements released from the “Office of the National Youth Leader Elect.”  In fact, the user’s profile photo features the incumbent Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki, which already established a relationship between the Deputy National Youth leader’s name and the area he hails from.  Further steps were taken to examine his photos to establish if the user was actually as old as 55 or 60, but all photos that appeared to be of him portray a hefty young man, at the time of examining the photos.  A message was then sent to the user to confirm if he was indeed the newly elected deputy national youth leader of the PDP to which he responded in the affirmative in less than an hour.  A question was further put to the user to clarify the facts of the controversy surrounding his age, Mr Osadolo denied that he was as old as claimed by some social media users.  He revealed that he was born on May 23rd 1985 at Central Hospital Benin City and issued a birth certificate on the same date Reacting further, he wrote, “It has been amusing seeing people ascribe different ages to me. It’s funny to have people judging me without bothering to know me. Some just look at my Facebook handle,see the title ‘ Elder’ and run with the notion that this is an old man. Laughable.”  Asked to provide documentary evidence that supports his claims, Mr. Osadolo shared a copy of his birth certificate, noting that it has been what he has been carrying since birth till date. “My public records are there for the public to access,” he replied.  It was observed that the name Osarumwense featured as his first name on the birth certificate while Osadolo followed. However, the name features as his identity on his facebook profile which he confirmed is his native name.  A digital forensic analysis of the document shared by Mr. Osadolo was done using the invid verifier forensic feature and the result showed no signs that the image may have been manipulated.  The claim that the newly elected PDP National Youth Leader, Timothy Osadolo, is 60-year-old is false. Findings show that he is 36, having been born on May 23rd, 1985 at the Central Hospital Benin City and issued a birth certificate on the same date.

Verification by Dubawa shows that 60 armoured vehicles were delivered to Nigeria by China, not 100 as claimed by Mr Igbokwe. The claim is, therefore, inaccurate and misleading. A Facebook post recently claimed that China has delivered 100 new armoured vehicles to Nigerian Army. The post which had garnered 312 reactions, six comments and 62 shares when it was made on Tuesday, 9th November 2021, was made by Mr Joe Igbokwe, a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and Special Adviser, Office of Drainage Services to the Lagos State Governor. He wrote; ‘China delivers another 100 new armoured vehicles to the Nigerian Army. May Nigeria Succeed (sic).’ This researcher, upon sighting the post by Mr Joe Igbokwe, set out on a search to verify the claim. The search was informed by the fact of Mr Igbokwe’s strong political posture and the growing influence of social media. A text message and email sent to him to request his source were not replied. This researcher then put a call to him and when confronted with the question that he substantiated his claim, he gave a terse response and hung up. “Go and investigate,” he said. However, media reports as recent as 28th October 2021 confirmed that the Nigerian Army took delivery  of ‘60 new VP – 1 Type Tracked Armoured Personnel Carriers manufactured in China to boost the ongoing war against Boko Haram insurgency and banditry in the North-East and North-West.’ As a follow up to the delivery and receipt of the armoured vehicles, it was also reported that the Nigerian Army also commissioned the 60 new VP – 1 Type Tracked Armoured Personnel Carriers from China to tackle the country’s insecurity challenges.  The report noted that the inauguration of the armoured vehicles was done at the Nigerian Army School of Infantry, Jaji, Kaduna, by the Commandant of Infantry Corps, Major General Victor Ezugwu, who represented the Chief of Army Staff, Lieutenant General Faruk Yahaya. Also, in a video on YouTube, Channels Television reported that the Nigerian Army inaugurated the 60 armoured vehicles. The video, posted on 29th October 2021, had been viewed 5,321 times as of the 9th of November.  Among the many media reports viewed by this reporter, and in a similar confirmation of the figures, another major national television station in Nigeria in a broadcast, indicated that the Nigerian Army had started deploying the 60 armoured vehicles in the fight against insurgency.  The report had been watched 10,950 times and liked 52 times on YouTube since 28th October 2021. In fact, a fuller bulletin of the story stated that the Nigerian Army had in over three months trained 106 personnel on the use and maintenance of the military hardware.  Meanwhile, in a rather speculative report, a news blog Defence Web, claimed that the Nigerian Army ‘may have acquired 100 additional CS/VP3 armoured personnel carriers (APCs) from China’s Poly Technologies and Type 89 tracked Infantry Fighting Vehicles (IFVs) from Norinco.’  Media reports from credible platforms indicate that the Nigerian Army received 60 armoured vehicles delivered by China, not 100 as claimed by Mr Joe Igbokwe.

The claim is True. In 2020, an FCT High Court ordered MTN to pay Emmanuel Anenih N5 million for disturbing his peace and N500,000 for legal expenses, making it a total sum of N5.5million  A WhatsApp message has been circulated on a group chat and privately to individuals that a Nigerian, by the name Emmanuel Anenih, had won a suit against MTN for unlawful deduction of N50 from his airtime for unsolicited caller tunes he did not subscribe to.  Armed with the information, some WhatsApp users are claiming that they would sue the telecommunication service provider to claim money in millions, as they also experience such. The WhatsApp message posted reads: “So a Nigerian by name Emmanuel Anenih took MTN to Court for unlawfully deducting 50 naira from his airtime in the name of unsolicited caller tunes he never subscribed to? An Abuja High Court found MTN guilty and ordered it to pay Emmanuel 5,000,000 for disturbing his peace and another 500,000 for legal expenses. Where is my phone? Let me check how many messages they have sent, I will also sue MTN by Monday.” A WhatsApp user reached out to Dubawa to fact check the claim. The WhatsApp user claimed the message had been posted on another WhatsApp group. A keyword search on Google showed reports referencing a court judgement delivered in February 2020 after Emmanuel Anenih dragged MTN to court in  2014 over unlawful deduction of N50.  Further checks revealed a two-minute video of the story published by the Nigerian Television Authority (NTA). According to the NTA report, Emmanuel Anenih had in October 2014 dragged MTN to court for illegal deduction over unsolicited caller tunes.  It stated that the court action came after various correspondences between the plaintiff and the service provider. It also stated that the court had established, in evidence, that MTN in one of its letters to the plaintiff admitted to the deductions as payment for the unsolicited caller tunes, but went ahead to send what it called “N700 bonus” to the plaintiff for his eight-year patronage after he had complained.  According to the NTA report, the then Chief Judge of the FCT, Ishaq in his judgement, said the N700 bonus did not amount to a compensation for the breach of the plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment. The judge then ordered MTN to pay N5 million as damages for disrupting the peace of the customer and an additional  N500,000 as cost for the case.

In one of the claims, it was recommended that using soft drinks, coca-cola or Pepsi, to put out a fire is recommended.  The long message which was supposed to give safety tips to Nigerians reads,  “I want to believe that some of us watched NTA News yesterday and saw the agony of the man whose wife was supposed to put to bed in a months time but lost her life to snakebite in Kikinau, Kaduna state. Reason for this post this morning.”  Another section of the post also focused on snakes and the use of salt to chase them away from one’s toilet and environs. Another claim was the mention that one or two bottles of coca-cola could help to put out a fire.  The post claimed, “ KITCHEN SAFETY *Keep 1 or 2 bottles of Coca-Cola or Pepsi in the Kitchen. Should a sudden fire occur, just open the bottle,shake it quickly & spray on to the fire.Please share this to everyone you know* Hello dear, don’t keep it to yourself please.”  The post which was widely shared on WhatsApp showed that the message had been forwarded many times as the writer had earlier implored people to  share and not hoard such ‘important information.’  Considering the importance of safety in homes, it is important to examine the components of a Coke/Pepsi in relation to that of a fire extinguisher. Coke and Pepsi are carbonated soft drinks. According to the official website of Pepsi, pepsi.co.uk,  Pepsi, comprises carbonated water, sugar, colour (caramel E150d), acid (phosphoric acid), flavourings (including caffeine). Just like Pepsi, Coke is made of the following components and proportions: Carbonated water – Approximately 90% of Coca-Cola is water. The carbonated part is purified carbon dioxide, which gives the drink its “bubbles” or “fizz.” Sugar – Coca-Cola Classic’s sweet taste (and also some of its mouthfeel) come from sugar. Coca-Cola Zero Sugar and Diet Coke are sugar-free. Caramel colour – A very specific caramel is made especially for Coca-Cola, to give the drink its characteristic colour. Phosphoric Acid – The tartness of Coca-Cola comes from the use of phosphoric acid. Caffeine – The slight bitterness in the taste of Coca-Cola comes from caffeine Natural flavours – The essence of the secret formula of Coca-Cola is its blend of natural flavours. This is the most protected and secret part of the formula.  Fire extinguishers on the other hand, according to  William L. Grosshandler, leader of the Fire Sensing and Extinguishment Group in the Building and Fire Research Laboratory at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, contain different chemicals, depending on the application.  Handheld extinguishers, which are commonly sold at hardware stores for use in the kitchen or garage, are pressurized with nitrogen or carbon dioxide (CO2) to propel a stream of fire-squelching agents to domestic fire. The active material may be a powder such as potassium bicarbonate (KHCO3), liquid water, an evaporating fluorocarbon or the propelling agent itself.  The most effective and common fluorocarbon used until recently for this application had been bromochlorodifluoromethane (CF2ClBr), referred to as halon 1211. By international agreement, however, production of all types of halons ceased in 1994 because the bromine and chlorine atoms in the chemical were found to migrate over time to the stratosphere, where they react to deplete ozone in a very efficient catalytic cycle. Although some online sources claim that some soft drinks douse simple fires, experts refuse to confirm if the claim was true or false. The Managing Director, Safety Consultants Solutions Provider, Mrs Anthonia Beri, said she wouldn’t confirm anything unscientific because ‘I don’t want anyone going to try anything funny at home, especially because of the sensitivity of safety-related issues.’  She said, “I will not subscribe to such activity because every industry or profession has a principle behind it.  “In the kitchen, you’re supposed to have a fire blanket because most of your fire is coming from your stove. The Best thing that you need to do is to throw a fire blanket over it or if you can, it is even better to take a wet bag and put it over there. So, it is cold and it suffocates the fire.” Beri said the stories and claims around using soft drinks to extinguish fire should be ignored.  She added, “ The story of coke and all that used to put out fire isn’t an acceptable principle. I will personally say get an extinguisher or a fire blanket. I will never confirm a thing like that if you’re fighting a pure fire, greasy fire. Fire has different characteristics, for example, it could be a petroleum fire, a gas fire and you’re trying to use coke or Pepsi. Such a thing shouldn’t be encouraged.” In the same vein, the Director of the Lagos State Fire and Rescue Service, Mrs Margaret Adeseye, told our correspondent that she does not support using coke and Pepsi as ingredients for putting out a fire.  She said, “Professionally, I will not be in support of using carbonated drinks for putting out fire. If I may ask, how many bottles of Coke or Pepsi in terms of quantity will be enough to fight a fire.” Adeseye asked if it was the water in the content or the chemical composition that made it suitable for fighting fire: “In terms of the content, is it the water inside the coke or the chemical that fought the fire?” “I know the one in the breakable bottle has more water composition or if it was the chemical inside it, then if it is the chemical, it should contain  Carbon dioxide and Nitrogen to mention a few of the most effective agents to fight fire.” Adeseye, however, advised that people should get fire extinguishers to be used to put out the fire especially in the homes.  She said, “ People should get fire extinguishers to fight fires.” Fire extinguishers and these soft drinks have similar ingredients which are water and carbon dioxide which can serve as fire squelching ingredients.  Confirming, Adeseye also said the major ingredients in a fire extinguisher are water, carbon dioxide and nitrogen and that the ingredients have also been confirmed to be present in both Coke and Pepsi.  Also, a professor Emeritus of Public Health at the Ryerson University, Timothy Sly, on Quora, a social question-and-answer website, said the water component of both soft drinks can put out fire. He added, “Yes, but it’s the water part that effectively douses the flames. If the bottle is shaken, the CO2 (Carbon dioxide) can help propel the water toward the conflagration. There are CO2 extinguishers, of course, and they discharge CO2 toward an electrical or class B fire.” Also, a Deputy Chief Officer of the Department of Delhi Fire Services, who stated that the bottled drinks have several chemicals which are similar to that of fire extinguishers.  He stated, “ It might douse simple fires because it’s liquid and reduces the heat but we would never use a Coca-Cola bottle to extinguish fires.  “The origin of fire is essential in determining which agent to use to stop the fire. Rather than keeping a stock of soda bottles, it’s advisable to keep a bucket of water for emergencies.” Yes. Coke or Pepsi may have fire quenching components of fire extinguishers, but experts warn against using them as extinguishers.

"Claim: A viral video was shared on  WhatsApp and Youtube purporting to be another fuel spill following the November 5 tanker explosion at Wellington in Freetown, Sierra Leone. The video showed people rushing to collect the spilling liquid.","Following the fuel tank explosion in Freetown on 5th November 2021, which left over ninety people dead and many others severely injured, a video of a similar incident was shared on social media claiming to have been recorded a few days after. In this video, people with buckets and other containers are seen rushing to collect a liquid substance spilling from a white tanker which had tipped over. A voice then explains that the substance leaking from the tank is kerosene and that the driver had lost control of the vehicle at Rogbere Junction in Port Loko, North-west of the country. Even though the voice in the video did not mention the date of the incident, people shared the video with the assumption that it was a recent occurrence. A news blog also carried the story with the headline “Another Fuel Tanker Crash.” The Member of Parliament for Constituency 069 which shares borders with the area where the kerosene tanker tipped over said the video in question is an old one, recalling. “The incident happened three to four months back,” he recalls. Honourable Abdul Karim Kamara also confirmed that the tanker was indeed carrying kerosene and was on its way to Lungi to supply fuel for airlines arriving at the airport.  “The driver had some mechanical faults but managed to cross the bridge before the vehicle eventually tipped over,” he explains. The councillor for Ward 257 Abu Bakarr Bangura added that even though he cannot remember the exact date, he knows the incident happened in May this year.  “There were no casualties, adding that the driver was able to get out of the vehicle before it tipped over,” Councillor Bangura confirms. The video in question was recycled and shared out of context  to stimulate dramatic and sensational reactions among the public.

"Claim: A post made by Dr. Damian Avar (@therealsabidoctor) claimed that persons experiencing burning sensation, fever after sex may be allergic to semen.","Having an allergy can be a nuisance and affect one’s everyday activities, but most allergic reactions are mild and can be largely kept under control. Severe reactions can occasionally occur, but these are uncommon. Recently, a post made by QEDaily claimed that persons experiencing burning sensations, fever after sex may be allergic to semen. The post attributed the claim to a medical doctor and sex consultant, Dr. Damian Avar, also known as “Sabi Doctor” who said men who develop a fever or feel a bit sick after releasing their semen could also be experiencing semen allergy. The Instagram post as of November 8, 2021, has 34, 957 views. An allergy  is an immune system response to a foreign substance that’s not typically harmful to a person’s body. A substance that causes an allergic reaction is called an allergen. Many allergens are everyday substances that are harmless to most people. Moreover, anything can be an allergen if the immune system has a specific type of adverse reaction to it.  Allergy comes with different symptoms that are not new to the body system. Some of the allergic reactions come with inflammation and irritation. And the signs and symptoms depend on the type of allergen that unleashes the attack. It might occur in the gut, skin, sinuses, airways, eyes, and nasal passages.  The immune system is part of the body and is composed of cells and their chemicals that work together to keep the body free of injurious agents such as infections. The immune response is not because of the noxious nature of the allergen but because of a misdirected recognition of the substance as harmful. Any substance which is recognized by the immune system is an antigen. In the case of people with allergies, the allergens are picked up by certain cells, called antigen-presenting cells that process them and allow them to be recognized by and to alert the innate immune system to their presence. In addition to other symptoms, dust and pollen allergy could come with blocked nose, itchy eyes and nose, runny nose, swollen and watery eyes, cough and others. Skin reactions include flaking, itching, peeling of skin and rashes, among others, while food allergy is characterised by vomiting, swollen tongue, tingling in the mouth, swelling of the lips, face, and throat, stomach cramps, shortness of breath and rectal bleeding, among others. There is also insect sting, which could also come with wheezing, swelling at the site of the sting, drop in blood pressure, itchy skin, shortness of breath, restlessness, hives, a red and very itchy rash that spreads across the body, dizziness, cough, chest tightness, anxiety and possible anaphylaxis, which usually is the last stage of conditions of allergy. A semen allergy, otherwise known as human seminal plasma hypersensitivity (HSP), is an allergic reaction to the proteins found in most men’s sperm. It is said to be a rare allergic reaction to proteins found in a man’s semen and it mostly affects women.  Studies show that it is possible to be allergic to your own semen. And when this happens, it is known as a post-orgasmic illness syndrome. A reproductive health expert, Dr. Ademola Ayodele, said it is possible to be allergic to semen as parts of the body in contact with the semen will begin to react unfavourably.  “It is possible to be allergic to semen, but where that burning sensation is might be different from what a layman thinks, the burning sensation will be in the private part; that is where the semen has touched. However, the fact that a woman reacts to semen does not mean she is allergic to all semen, there could just be antibodies raised in a particular individual’s semen, and that is why sometimes a woman finds it difficult to get pregnant for a particular person but when she exchanges partner, it is discovered that she is able to get pregnant,” he said. He added that although possible, cases of a woman being allergic to semen are very rare. “Such cases are very rare and the word allergy is very serious because it simply means that if not treated, it would keep disturbing the woman and she may die from it.” The Chief Medical Director of the University of Medical Sciences Teaching Hospital UNIMEDTH, Dr. Adesina Akintan, said the claim that experiencing a burning sensation or fever after sex could be a sign of being allergic to semen is false. “Being allergic to semen after sex is not true, there is nothing like that; it is not true. If the woman develops some symptoms after sex, it might be due to other factors and not because she is allergic to semen,’ he added. A gynecologist, Dr. Joel Sola Akande, said there is a distant possibility that the claim is true. He added, ‘If the victim was infected before sex, then it has nothing to do with semen, but semen generally speaking does not cause allergy except in rare cases and under certain circumstances. It is a distant possibility for people to be allergic to semen.’ According to a study by the International society for sexual medicine (ISSM), sperm allergy is a rare allergic reaction whose symptoms include, redness, swelling, pain, itching, and a burning sensation in the vaginal areas. The symptoms usually start about 10-30 minutes after contact with semen. Although the symptoms may not be confined to the vaginal area, they can occur in any area that has contact with semen, including the skin and mouth. The study further added that for some women, the symptoms are localized; meaning they stay in one major area, and for others, the symptoms can affect their whole body. They may have hives, swelling, trouble breathing, or anaphylaxis- a life-threatening allergic reaction. Another report reveals that systematic reactions are experienced as dyspnea, dysphagia,  rhinoconjunctivitis complaints, generalized urticaria, angioedema, gastrointestinal symptoms, exacerbation of existing atopic eczema, or anaphylactic shock. The report added that it has been reported that semen allergy may present ‘vulvar vestibulitis syndrome’ or ‘burning semen syndrome.’ These symptoms may occur during the first sexual intercourse. And some results are indicative of allergens originating from the prostate, prostate-specific antigen being clinically relevant. Although rare, it is possible to be allergic to semen, specifically to the proteins found in sperm. And although the symptoms may not be confined to the vaginal area, they can occur in any area that has contact with semen, including the skin and mouth.

Claim: A post on Instablo9ja points to phone torchlight as the cause of a gas explosion that killed a footballer a day before his birthday.,"There have been various claims on social media about a gas explosion caused by a phone torchlight about which a young talented footballer identified as Enwongo Derick Udosen and two other persons have attracted the sympathy of online users on various social media platforms.  On instablog9ja, the talented footballer was alleged to have died a day before his birthday due to a gas explosion that was triggered by the torchlight on his phone. The unfortunate incident  was said to have occurred on the 6th of October, 2021, along Nwanniba Road, Uyo, just a day to  the footballer’s birthday. The post on Instablog9ja further explained that: “It was gathered that a fellow tenant had wanted to prepare food and used his phone torchlight for illumination before striking a match to ignite his gas cylinder, which immediately exploded, killing him and Udosen.” The story also resurfaced on Linda Ikeji’s blog posing the same narrative, even adding that: “The Director of the Akwa Ibom State Fire Service, Ubong Umoh, lamented that his organisation had, frequently, warned users of gas cylinders against using phone torchlight when cooking.” Other news platforms such as  Orange Sports news page and  Neighbourhood News Today reported that Mr Udosen’s death was also due to the gas explosion ignited by the phone torchlight.  However, some users who commented on the matter implied that other causes aside from phone torchlight might have triggered the accident.  A user, T. Osikirin,  commented, “He lit the gas cooker, not knowing that it was leaking. I was staying in my room when I heard an explosion.” Another comment from another person addressed as Anonymous said “This country makes me sad. Incidents like this are quite avoidable but we are in an impoverished  country where people can barely afford anything. RIP man, all his dreams now gone. This is unfair.” Another comment from another “Anonymous” source said, “A leaky gas cooker caused the explosion and not a phone torchlight. Even those who should know speak like idiots.” While the Death of the young footballer may also be a matter for public debate, the arguments seem to revolve around the possibility of a phone’s torchlight triggering a gas explosion. Hence, the point for verification.  There are numerous narratives around what triggers gas explosions. However, according to research by Zinda Law Group, a nationwide personal Injury Lawyer in Dallas, USA, gas explosion primarily take place when a spark is brought near a leaking gas. The research did not point to a telephone torchlight as a causative agent of gas explosion. The Director, Kwara State Fire service, Prince Falade John Olumuyiwa, also said a phone torchlight could cause a gas explosion. The Fire safety expert explained that when naked light is brought near uncontrolled gas, an explosion can  occur.  “It is obvious that cell phones are not friendly with gas appliances because the two elements travel in waves. The radioactivity of both waves can influence the atmospheric pressure of the gas against inner pressure which could eventually lead to expansion and contraction and eventually, a possible explosion.” he said.  He further elucidated that “even a flash from a camera can spark the petrol in a can, not to talk of gas which is highly inflammable. When the two waves between a radio or television collide on the same parallel line, it is called electromagnetic jams, and a phone can ignite any highly inflammable products,” he explains. Mrs. Medina Adesola Salami, an expert in electromagnetic radiation and an Engineer of the department of Electrical Engineering, Kwara State Polytechnic, explained that electromagnetic radiation needs only a spark to ignite fire or an explosion to occur.  Engineer Salami said, “There have been various research on whether a phone can spark an explosion and many of the research have similar outcomes: It is possible because of radiation generated from sparks between two metals and gas which is subconsciously in the air.”  Regarding the claim in question,  Engineer Salami identified three factors that could have led to the death of the footballer. She said the match that was lit is the first possible factor.   “You know when you open a door, metals clash to allow the door open, that slight touch between the two metals is enough to generate a spark into an enclosed environment where gas has leaked to cause the explosion,” she pointed out. She attributed the  second factor to a click on the phone. “The movement of radiation can also ignite a spark and when combined with a leaked gas cylinder in a room, an explosion may be imminent,” she categorically emphasised.  “It is not the rays of light from the torchlight that causes the spark but a click on the phone is a go-ahead for two metals inside the phone to radiate a spark into the atmosphere that has gas,” Salami added.  Radiation from  a mobile phone can cause an explosion when it meets on a parallel line with the radiation from a leaking gas cylinder. So it is not  the rays of light from a phone that causes an explosion when it comes in contact with leaking gas, but a spark in the phone. Nonetheless, experts warn the general public not to use their phones close to  gas cylinders (which could be leaking) as a major precaution. Thanks for this information This information has been going around for decades. We just need some scientific backing for it ",FALSE-,11/11/2021,https://dubawa.org/radiation-from-phone-not-torchlight-causes-gas-explosion/
"Claim: A Facebook user by the name Gbola Fash and an online platform PEGASUS Reporters claim that Nigeria’s former Petroleum Minister, Deizani Alison-Madueke’s bra is the world’s most expensive bra at $12.5 Million (E8.5-Million).","Claim: A Facebook user by the name Gbola Fash and an online platform PEGASUS Reporters claim that Nigeria’s former Petroleum Minister, Deizani Alison-Madueke’s bra is the world’s most expensive bra at $12.5 Million (E8.5-Million). This claim is false! There was nowhere the EFCC or the Office of the Attorney General indicated that the former minister had the world’s most expensive bra among her forfeited items. On October 27th 2021, social media went agog with online reports that the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) was valuing some forfeited items of Nigeria’s embattled ex-petroleum minister, Deizani Alison-Madueke. What caused the online frenzie were reports that among items valued are personal effects including trainers and bras which some tagged as the world’s most expensive. Since then, many Nigerians have taken to social media to either mock or disparage the former minister.  Gbola Fash wrote: “Former Petroleum Minister Diezani Madueke’s bra 4 sale at 2m per one. The most expensive bra in the world. Ole Oloriburuku” Umar Rigasa Media, another Facebook user said: “FG puts Diezani’s 30 bras, others for sale. They are the world’s most expensive bra @the $12.5 Million (E8.5-Million) Heavenly star bra, by sapphires and as its centrepiece a 90-carat emerald cut diamond that was worth  $10.6 million (E7.28 million) alone at the time.”  Still on the bra, Muhammad Kabir Salim Babajo wrote: “She was wearing the whole Nigeria’s yearly budget on her chest. Oh God Save Nigeria.” The name Diezani Alison-Madueke rings a bell as one of Nigeria’s most powerful politicians whose exit from political office in 2015 was marred by allegations of corruption. Alison-Madueke, who will be 61 years in December presently resides in the United Kingdom, where she is under investigation for money laundering after she left Nigeria in a hurry at the twilight of former President Goodluck Jonathan’s administration in 2015.   Diezani Alison-Madueke is the daughter of chief Frederick and Beatrice Abiye Agama and was married to a former Chief of Naval Staff, Rear Admiral Alison Madueke (rtd). She has held three Ministerial portfolios in Nigeria between 2007 and 2015. She was first appointed as Minister of Transportation by then President Umaru Musa Yar’adua and served between July 2007 and December 2008. Due to a cabinet reshuffle, she was, in 2008, moved to the Ministry of Mines and Steel Development where she served as Minister until March 2010. In April 2010, then-President Goodluck Jonathan appointed Alison-Madueke as Minister of Petroleum Resources, the first female to hold such a position in Nigeria. She held the position between 2010 and 2015 until President Muhammadu Buhari came into office. During her tenure as Petroleum Minister, then President Goodluck Jonathan signed the Nigerian Content Act which allowed more percentages of contracts in the petroleum industry to be awarded to indigenous Nigerian companies and businesses.  Since she stepped down as Minister and fled to the UK where she holds a British citizenship, Mrs. Alison-Madueke has been accused of stealing government funds to the tune of $2.5 billion, an allegation she denies. While in the UK, she was arrested in October 2015 on allegations of money laundering by British agents of the National Crime Agency. After she was arraigned in court, she was later released on bail while investigations are ongoing. Shortly after, Dele Momodu, publisher of the popular Ovation magazine and newspaper columnist, released photos of a cancer-stricken Mrs. Alison-Madueke in the debut issue of his new tabloid called Boss magazines where the former minister denied stealing money. The photos elicited several debates on social media with some Nigerians accusing her of lying to garner sympathy.   But in a 2019 published book titled: ‘Riding the Storms with God on my Side,’  her husband, Rear Admiral Alison Madueke (rtd.), revealed that the former minister had in 2015 lost her ability to speak and subsequently went into a coma due to complications of cancer.   Though the retired naval officer says his wife is now fully recovered, Deizani continues to face more troubles as a 2019 report released by Transparency International revealed that she purchased three London properties using suspected bribes from oil deals. An Al Jazeera investigation; ‘Diplomats for Sale’ in 2019 revealed that Mrs. Alison Madueke had purchased a Dominican passport shortly before she fled to London. The Nigerian media space dug into the report and in 2020, reports indicated that the diplomatic passport was aimed at providing the ex-oil boss immunity from criminal prosecution.    By May 2021, the EFCC said it recovered $156million and 80 properties worth $80million from the ex-oil minister. This is even as a Nigerian court has denied an application of the EFCC seeking an order for the issuance of a warrant for her arrest. Most recently, as part of the lists of assets said to have been forfeited by Mrs. Alison-Madueke, the Nigerian Government listed properties located at Ikoyi, Banana Island Foreshore Estate in Lagos including 18 flats and six penthouses. The government also listed items such as 125 wedding gowns, 13 small gowns, 11 suites, 41 waist trainers, 11 invisible bras, 30 brasiers as well as magic skirts and others.   Diezani Alison-Madueke is a well-educated woman who has occupied high positions and excelled in Nigeria’s male-dominated oil and gas sector as well as political landscape.  Despite controversies surrounding her exit as Minister of Petroleum Resources and the various corruption charges against her, it is pertinent to note that Alison-Madueke either by fate or sheer competence has held many firsts as a woman.  Before her stint in politics, she became the first woman to be appointed as the Executive Director of Shell Petroleum Development Corporation in Nigeria in 2006. In 2007, she became the first woman to hold the position of Minister of Transportation in Nigeria and also the first woman to hold the position of Minister of Petroleum Resources in 2010.   Alison-Madueke was also the first woman to head a country delegation at the semi-annual Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) conference and became the first female OPEC President in 2014.  Every year, in the last 25 years, one Victoria’s Secret model is selected to wear what has come to be known as the Fantasy Bra. The Fantasy bra is a special garment worth millions of dollars worn on a runway show which began in 1996 when supermodel, Claudia Schiffer stunned the world in a diamond-encrusted bra called the “Million Dollar Miracle Bra” with a price tag of $1million. Since then, the annual runway show with beautiful models wearing lingerie has garnered more fans with the most anticipated section of the annual event, the announcement and unveiling of the year’s Victoria’s Secret Fantasy Bra. One supermodel called an ‘Angel’ is selected to wear the designated Fantasy Bra to walk the runway with fashion experts describing it as one of the highest honours in fashion.  According to the Guinness World Records, the world’s most expensive bra is the $12.5 million (£8.5-million) heavenly star bra by Victoria secret, created in 2001 and won on the catwalk by supermodel Heidi Klum. The picture above is a 2002 Fantasy bra valued at $10,000. Based on Victoria’s Secret collection, the most expensive bra is the diamond and Thai ruby-encrusted lingerie won in 2000 by Gisele Bundchen which comes with a $15 million-dollar price tag. However, the Guinness World Record places the $12.5-million (£8.5-million) Heavenly Star Bra, by Victoria’s Secret, created in 2001 and won on the catwalk by supermodel Heidi Klum as the world’s most expensive bra. The bra features 1,200 Sri Lankan pink sapphires and as its centrepiece, a 90-carat emerald cut diamond that was worth $10.6 million (£7.28 million) at the time. Even though the 2005 Sexy Splendor Fantasy Bra also had a $12.5-million selling price, in comparative terms, its value is less than the Fantasy bra of 2001. What makes the fantasy bra expensive is that each of the bras advertised in the Victoria’s Secret catalogue or worn on the catwalk during the fashion show has a jewel-encrusted centrepiece. Prior to each fashion show, Victoria’s Secret is said to contract a renowned jewellery designer to craft the bra to be used as a focal point for promoting the fashion show and as a centrepiece within it. However, only the centrepiece from the 2004 Heavenly “70” Fantasy Bra and the 2012 Floral Fantasy Bra and Gift Set has found a buyer. If not bought, the bras are usually dismantled after a year. Having gone through all the various published reports on the forfeiture of Diezani Alison-Madueke’s properties and personal effects, this reporter found that the source of the report was the Punch Newspaper.  However, the report was also published and circulated by The Cable and Sahara Reporters. All reports were published on October 27th 2021 and made reference to lists of assets said to have been forfeited by Mrs Alison-Madueke.  The items were listed as: Properties located at Ikoyi, Banana Island Foreshore Estate in Lagos including 18 flats and six penthouses. Other items include 125 wedding gowns, 13 small gowns, 11 suites, 41 waist trainers, 11 invisible bras, 30 brasiers as well as magic skirts and others.   Though 11 invisible bras and 30 brasiers were listed among the forfeited items, none of the reports valued the bras or stated if any of the bras had been valued as the most expensive in the world. This reporter also found that the specific photo of the bra used to accompany the claims above that Diezani’s bra are the most expensive are actually photos from the “Fantasy bra” collections of Victoria’s Secrets designed in 2002 and worn by Karolina Kurkova which is valued at $10million. It is,  therefore, not the most expensive bra in the world. The award for the most expensive bra, according to Guinness World Records, had gone to the 2001 fantasy bra won on the catwalk by Heidi Klum. It is valued as the world’s most expensive bra and valued at $12.5 million (£8.5-million) created by Victoria secret in 2001. Records have it that only the 2004 Heavenly “70” Fantasy Bra and the 2012 Floral Fantasy Bra and Gift Set from Victoria’s Secret collections of fantasy bras have found buyers. The two are not the most expensive bras and therefore couldn’t have been among Diezani’s collection. Other fantasy bras including the 2021 bra, valued at $12.5 million have all been dismantled.  This reporter also contacted the EFCC to verify if any of the forfeited bras had been valued as the world’s most expensive, but the spokesperson of the anti-corruption commission in Nigeria, Wilson Uwujaren, referred her to the office of the Attorney General of the Federation which he said was in charge of the forfeited items. On reaching out to the office of the Attorney General, the Media aid to the Attorney General of the Federation, Malam Umar Gwandu, said he was not aware of “any most expensive bra from Diezani’s forfeited items.”  The claim that among items forfeited by Nigeria’s former Petroleum Minister, Diezani Alison-Madueke, is the world’s most expensive bra, valued at $12.5 Million (E8.5-Million) is false. Findings show that pictures circulated as Diezani’s bra are from the Victoria’s secrets collection of Fantasy bra which is a special garment worth millions of dollars worn on runways since 1996.

It will also  be a complementary legal tender in Nigeria, having the same exchange value as the Naira and maintaining a parity of value as the Naira.  One interesting feature of the eNaira is that it will not earn any interest to the holder, and it is built on a blockchain open ledger technology. This simply implies that  you cannot have a duplicate of eNaira or a fake version of it because each note will be unique. The message offered a link for users to register. Therein, users are asked to input some of their personal information like name, state, Bank account etc. and afterwards, they are also urged to share the link to a certain number of users before accessing the said amount.  Further clicks showed a page with a congratulatory message and a number of testimonials from persons purported to have benefitted from the scheme.  This is not the first time DUBAWA has analysed similar links promising money to the general public; all findings point to the fact that these links are either a phishing scam or a fraud. It is based on past experiences that DUBAWA opts to verify this information.  Dubawa first carried out an analysis of the link on Scamdoc, a free online tool that verifies websites. Findings from the analysis revealed the link in question to be a data phishing website. Such websites are usually riddled with installed root pop-up ads that generate traffic through fraudulent schemes; worse still, they engage in the extraction of users’ data and financial details for nefarious purposes.  Furthermore, Dubawa visited the website of the Central Bank of Nigeria and all its social media handles to find out if there was such an offer. Results show no offer was made on either their website or their social media handles.  In fact, the apex bank has already released a disclaimer that refuted the claim and clarified that the message did not emanate from the CBN.  Dubawa also received an E-naira scam alert issued by the Nigeria Information Technology Agency NTIDA, Federal Ministry of Communication and Digital Economy, and Cert. Org informing the citizens about the scam. .. Scammers have always capitalized on new inventions to defraud unsuspecting members of the public. Since the launch of the eNaira, scammers have been luring citizens with messages related to the online currency with the intention to woo unsuspecting Nigerians such as in this case. As such, it is not true that the Central Bank of Nigeria, through the directives of the Finance Minister is disbursing 50 Billion e-naira currency to citizens who are willing to register and get the e-Naira wallet. It is a scam and the CBN has debunked the message. The fact check was produced per 2021 Kwame Karikari fellowship in partnership with the National Orientation Agency to facilitate the ethos of truth in journalism and enhance media literacy in the country.

Claim: A viral WhatsApp video claims that soldiers are attacking residents of a community in Anambra State.,"It’s days before the Anambra gubernatorial elections and the headlines are already buzzing with the rumors and occurrences of violence across the state. Expecting the soaring chaos around the elections, the federal government has deployed over 34, 000 police officers to boost the security situation in the state.  Anambra State has registered poor voter turnout in past gubernatorial elections and this has been  largely linked to insecurity and electoral violence. The southeast has also been ridden with the activities of the Independent Peoples of Biafra (IPOB). The group has been imposing a stay-at-home in the region and is frequently  reported to have clashed with the army.  Even more, now that Nnamdi Kanu, the leader of IPOB, is being incarcerated by the federal government, the group has threatened to disrupt the upcoming gubernatorial elections and deter people from voting if Mr Kanu is not released.   It is amidst this reality that a viral video surfaced, depicting some men, outfitted in Army uniform sporadically shooting and setting some buildings ablaze in an environment the attached narrative claims to be a village in Anambra State.  The 23 seconds footage was widely shared on WhatsApp, arousing mostly fear amongst users who have come across it. “The government should just postpone this Anambra Elections. People will just die for nothing.” Insinuated a user on one WhatsApp group.  Yet it didn’t stop there, the same video reappeared on Twitter, this time with a slightly different caption: “Nigerian soldiers shooting and burning villages”. It garnered over 180,000 views close to 2000 retweets and close to 3000 reactions.  While many users who commented on the post inquired where the video actually took place, the user, Knightsnkardinals (@ThisisKandK) offered no explanations.  Already, there is a lingering fear among voters in Anambra, and a good number of the comments on the  video points to that. An apparent theme from the comments inclines the potential of the video to  not only dissuade people from going out to vote, but also to anticipate violence on the election day.  An analysis carried out on the video showed it was not doctored nor altered. The video frame of the footage suggests it was covered using a mobile phone. Though we could not trace where it first appeared or who shared it first. Analysis of the keyframes on InVid video verifier showed the video appeared recently online.  Open source tools used to pinpoint the actual location yielded no detailed results. Since the location was apparently a village, there were no major landmarks to determine the location. However, other reports made by major Nigerian dailies, such as Punch Newspaper, Thisday, and the Sahara reporters alleged that soldiers of the Nigerian Army had on Monday, November 1st,  invaded Isingwu, a hamlet in Imama Village, Mgbowo in Awgu Local Government Area of Enugu State. While none of the reports mentioned Anambra State.  Dubawa reached out to Major Abubakar Abdullahi, the acting Deputy Director Public Relations of the 82 Division Nigerian Army, via a text message and followed up with phone calls to clarify the claim that the video was shot in Anambra State, but no response from him was registered.  However, in a press release made by the Nigerian army on Facebook, they alleged that  soldiers  had earlier carried out a raid in Mgbowo, Awgu Local Government Area that same day, 1st November.   “Troops of Joint Security Team have raided a suspected Indigenous People of Biafra/Eastern Security Network (IPOB/ESN) hideout located in Mgbowo, Awgu Local Government Area on 1 November 2021. During the night operation, two ring leaders of IPOB/ ESN were arrested. The suspects are currently undergoing interrogation by a security agency. In the statement, the army neither denied nor accepted that the men outfitted in the Nigerian military uniform are soldiers.  “It should be noted that, contrary to IPOB/ESN propaganda video, there was no incident of indiscriminate firing or unprovoked burning of houses during the raid. The joint operation in Agwu was conducted in the night and there was no destruction of any private property involved.” And the second paragraph reads:  “Investigation into the video is ongoing to ascertain when and where it was shot and those involved. Any personnel found culpable would be sanctioned accordingly. Updates will be communicated when the investigation is completed,” adding that any act of unprofessional conduct among  troops will not be tolerated. While there is no sufficient evidence to prove where it actually happened, the claim that it has  taken place in Anambra is baseless. The claimant did not mention where in Anambra state or even when. While different sources suggest that there was an army raid in Mgbowo, Agwu LGA, Enugu State, there is no single claim from open sources that backs the occurrence of the shooting in the footage in Anambra.  Solomon Ifeanyi, a resident of Akwa, Anambra State, said via a phone call that “we heard that the army had clashed with IPOB members in Enugu,  Tuesday morning (November 2nd) but I don’t think it was anywhere in Anambra.” There is insufficient evidence to back up the claim that the incident in the video happened in  Anambra state. However,  evidence gathered suggests the event took place in Enugu, though we could not ascertain where exactly in Enugu.

Claim: A video on Instagram claims members of the PDP are inducing voters ahead of the Anambra State election.,"An Instagram post by @thetattleroomng claims members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) are inducing voters by giving them N400 and a can of malt ahead of the election. “Anambra election: PDP members seen giving out 400 Naira and a can of Malt to voters ahead of the gubernatorial election this weekend”, caption on the post reads. This same video was shared by @Instablog9ja with the same claim gathering about 11,360 likes and 663 comments an hour after it was shared.  “Anambra Guber Election: Electorates seen receiving N400 and a can of Malt ahead of Saturday,” instablog9ja’s caption reads. While some viewers in the comment section of this post expressed their shock and dissatisfaction, others say this is staged as no sane person will wear his or her party’s identity to do such thing. This prompted us to do this check. Dubawa could not find this video anywhere with Google reverse image and video search as well as with the InVid tool. This suggests the video is new, not a recirculated one. We also watched, listened, analysed and had the parts spoken igbo translated to get the content and context of the video. From both videos, we deduced that the man sharing the money in the first video who was wearing PDP’s camouflage on his neck, was asking the young boy if he had a voter’s card. He also asked when he registered to be sure he had the voter’s card. “Do you have a voter’s card, oya take….say thank you, shut up,” he said. The money handler was seen giving N200 to some people and N400 to others. Apparently, those without voter’s cards got N200 with their malt while those with voter’s cards got N400 with their Malt. We also noticed an aged woman with a baby was given N600 (three 200 naira notes) which she said was because of her grandchild she was carrying.  The Dialogue in the footage suggested the event took place at Nimo Town, Njikoka Local Government Area (LGA) and the people are apparently from the same town. When one of the receiver’s identity was questioned (if he was from Nimo) by the ‘money handler’ with the orange hat, the other person handing drinks quickly confirmed that  the receiver  is a mechanic and is truly from Nimo.  Nimo town is a town in Njikoka LGA, Anambra state, South-east geopolitical zone of Nigeria.  Dubawa, therefore, went ahead to do a keyword search which led to a blog post by gistmania.com with the headline  “PDP members caught giving out 400 naira and a can of malt to voters ahead of the Anambra election.”  The same video posted on Instagram by @tattleroomng was linked to this post.  Another post by legitpost.com.ng carried the same story but this time it claims it is the All Progressives Congress (APC) inducing voters ahead of the poll. Although this blog post carries screenshots of the same video with the same man wearing the PDP party’s camouflage, it says the perpetrators are members of the APC which is contradictory. Although the money handler wore a PDP attire and our findings show that money is being shared to people, we do not have enough evidence to ascertain if the man in the video is actually a PDP member. However, evidence gleaned from the video shows that it was shot recently ahead of the Anambra election.

Claim: A Press Release gone viral on Social Media claims the International Air Transport Association (IATA) has banned Sierra Leone’s President Bio from all overseas travels.,"A document going viral on social media platforms including WhatsApp has created doubt in the minds of Sierra Leoneans regarding a pupported ban from all overseas travels placed upon the president of the Republic of Sierra Leone Julius Maada Bio. WhatsApp users reached out to Dubawa asking to confirm the authenticity of the claim as the release looks real.  “The ban on entry on IATA member air flights by the President of Sierra Leone , Maada Bio will be effective on 30th November, 2021,” the first paragraph of the release stated. The reasons stated in the release for the ban includes a recommendation made from the European Union report on Sierra Leone which the release relates to the frequent travel habit of the President. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) is the global trade association of airlines. The organization now represents  290 airlines in 120 countries and comprises 83% of total air traffic.  Dubawa reached out to IATA’s communication officers through email and they stated that the said document was not from the International Air Transport Association. To further verify the claim, Dubawa further searched the social media handles of IATA on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and as well as the website to ascertain the veracity of the claim. The claim was not spotted on any of these social media handles. The website has a section for press releases and it was also reached to check the latest releases but this claim was not found there.  Two press releases were issued by IATA on November 3, 2021: the first was titled “Air Cargo, up 9.1% in September, Capacity Remains Constrained” and the second one was on “Moderate Rebound in September passenger demand.” There is no press release about the subject of ban on anyone on the IATA website. Contact information for IATA press releases usually comes from Corporate Communication with the following number and phone number. Here is the authentic email and number that is attached to IATA press releases Email: [email protected] Number: +41 22 770 2967 The communication details attached at the end of the release on the travel ban is the communication contact information for IATA Latin America, which is not the standard practice of IATA as observed in the numerous press releases on their website. Additionally, the house style of IATA press releases was not followed on this document under investigation. Authentic IATA Press Releases are numbered at the top left hand corner as seen below.  The next line is where the date is. The circulated press release doesn’t have a date or a number. Dubawa carefully analyzed the claim by checking the red flags on the release as well as conducting investigations on the organization and firmly confirms that the claim saying President Bio has been banned from travelling overseas is false.

Claim: A viral WhatsApp message claims 47 judges of the World Human Right Court have declared no right to homosexuals.,"The argument around the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual or Transgender (LGBT) rights has been ongoing for a while and there are varying stances on this all over the world. While there is the movement to legalise same sex marriage as a human right, some countries are against this. Amidst this divide, a viral WhatsApp message claims 47 judges of the World Human Right Court have ruled against homosexuals. It reads, “47 Judges of World Human Right Court Declares;No Rights To Homosexual…This judgment implies that: States are free to reserve marriage only to heterosexuals.” The message which came with the call for receivers to broadcast also claims Article 12 of the European Convention on Human Rights supports the claims and is  validated by Article on Human Right Treaties as in the case of 17 of the pact and No 23 of International Covenants on Civil and political Rights. A keyword search shows similar reports on the ruling against same sex marriage (homosexuals) dating back to 2010.  A report by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) in 2010 noted that the European human rights court rejected the gay marriage bid. The court noted individual countries were in the best position to determine their law on the issue. Another report by the International Centre for Investigative Reporting (ICIR) in 2017 noted that world court has ruled that homosexual marriage is not a human right. The report added that this decision was reached by 47 judges of the 47 countries of the Council of Europe that makes up the full Court of Strasbourg. Also, according to this report, the judgment was based on Article 12 of the European Convention on Human Rights and is equivalent to article 23 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. What does Article 12 of the European Convention on Human Rights  say? Section 12 of the European Convention on human rights states that men and women of marriageable age have the right to marry and start a family according to the national laws governing the exercise of this right. Also, article 23 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights recognizes the family as a natural and fundamental unit of society entitled to protection by society and the State. Dubawa’s findings show that while this report is true, it is stale or outdated, making the claim misleading.

Claim:  A viral WhatsApp message on security tips claims that the message came from the Inspector General of the Sierra Leone Police Ambrose Sovula.,"A WhatsApp message which has been shared on various WhatsApp groups as well as to individuals containing security tips claims to have come from the Inspector General of Police Ambrose Sovula. The message which has nineteen (19) tips explains how citizens should secure themselves.  “Don’t allow your children who can’t recognize voices to open doors for strangers/visitors,” says tip one. The message furthered that, “ stay away from any strange man, who looks like a pregnant woman; he may be carrying harmful products.”  The message concluded by requesting that it should be rebroadcast to family and friends, adding that security is everybody’s business.  The Assistant Commissioner of the Sierra Leone Police Brima Kamara confirms to Dubawa that the viral WhatsApp message did not come from his boss nor from the Sierra Leone Police as an institution.  This was made known to Dubawa when he was contacted via WhatsApp to verify the message.  “No! Even though some of the security tips contained therein are appropriate for one’s personal security; they are not coming from us,” says ACP Brima Kamara.  To further cross check such a claim, Dubawa searched the website of the Sierra Leone Police to see if such a message was posted to no avail.  Conclusion Whilst the content of the security tips are commendable, Dubawa is setting the record straight  that no such message came from the Inspector General of Police nor from the Sierra Leone Police institution itself.

"Claim: Nigeria’s President Muhammadu Buhari recently blamed the increasing cost of food items in the country on middlemen, who he alleged, were hoarding essential commodities for profit.","President Buhari has said during  a recent nationwide broadcast that middlemen are responsible for the rising food prices in the country. The president also disclosed that he had directed the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development to rehabilitate the National Food Reserve Agency to address the continued rise in food prices. In his words: “The Agricultural sector remains key to our economic diversification efforts as the sector has been a consistent driver of the non-oil sector contributing 22.35% and 23.78% to the overall GDP in the first and second quarter of 2021. “We have seen significant private sector investments in almost all areas of the agricultural value chain. And these have continued even during the COVID-19 pandemic. “Unfortunately, as our food production capacity has increased, food prices have been going up due to artificial shortages created by middlemen who have been buying and hoarding these essential commodities for profiteering…” Middlemen, also referred to as intermediaries, play a vital part in ensuring that the distribution channel between the producer and the consumer is complete. This was not the first time the President would blame the high cost of food items in the country on middlemen.  In September 2020, he also blamed middlemen for rising food prices in the country at the time. In a series of tweets via his verified Twitter handle, Buhari noted that the government is conscious of the challenge of high food prices, amidst a poor economy rocking the world due to the global coronavirus situation. He, however, said middlemen, among other factors, are responsible for rising food prices. “We are also engaging with food producers associations and groups to tackle the issue of exploitative behaviour by middlemen and other actors, which is one of the factors responsible for the high food prices being experienced,” the Nigerian leader wrote. In verifying this, Dubawa examines other factors, aside from the role of middlemen, that may have contributed to rising food prices. Dubawa conducted research into factors that may have been responsible for the increasing cost of food items in the country.  In a report by the World Food Programme, over 13 million Nigerians are food-insecure during the lean season with some 4.4 million in the northeast.  In Nigeria, there has been a high level of food insecurity for the past four decades. This, undoubtedly, is a major factor in the rising cost of food prices in the country. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), food insecurity has been on the rise since Buhari was elected into power in 2015. While data shows that demand for food has continued to increase since 2014 due to the country’s rising population, there is no corresponding growth in the amount of food production largely due to surging insecurity, inconsistent government policy, poverty among others. Dr. Tayo Bello, a developmental Economist and Associate Professor of Law at Babcock University, has expantiated on the Consumer Price Index in an interview with Dubawa.  He defined the CPI as the basket of goods which typically is the product of services purchased by individuals. He said, “Importantly, the CPI serves as a barometer for any economy because once it brings inflation, inflation will affect the purchasing power of consumers and it is a serious threat to any economy either developed or developing and it is through this consumer index that you can derive cost of living index.” According to him CPI measures the price of consumer goods and it is a tool to measure inflation and can.be used to formulate the future economy. Dr. Bello said inflation can be caused by various factors citing the types of inflation.  Speaking on the demand-pull inflation, he explained that this situation arises when the aggregate demand is higher than the goods available. He added: ”When you talk of cost-push it is as a result of aggregate increase in cost of production. “For example, with the way foreign exchange earnings are declining coupled with rising foreign currencies, there’s no way you will not have a cost push. What we’re having in Nigeria now is cost-push, it’s not like we have a sudden increase in population. “The last one is built-in inflation which can be as a result of production cost or other factors,” he stated. While making reference to the present inflation rate in Nigeria which is 16%, he noted that the country suffers from galloping inflation, taking into consideration the inflation rate of 15.7% in 2016. He said, “Investors pay more attention to CPI because it is an indicator of where the economy is going, it is also a barometer that can be used to forecast inflation and sensitive assets. There’s no rational investor that will go into a country where you know that what they have is persistent increase in the cost of goods and services which is inflation. There was a time I discussed with the press on ‘LikeAMonkey’ inflation (zig zag) and that’s what we have in Nigeria. “The present inflation rate in Nigeria is 16% and the projection is that by 2022, it will be 13.5%. Let’s go back to the inflation rate from 2016. In 2016, the inflation rate was 15.7%, in 2017, it was 16.5%, in 2018, it was 12.09% and in 2019 it was 11.4%, and we’re talking of 2021, 16%. “If you look back, the inflationary rate was lower in 2019. With this, there’s no way the economy will not be affected because there’s no steadiness. Once we have that trend, what will happen is the economy and the barometer which the CPI measures will show a red indicator and when that happens, it means the economy is not going in the right direction.” Between 2018 and 2020, for instance, an average 21.4 percent of Nigeria’s population reportedly experienced hunger. In 2014, Nigeria’s population was at 176,404,931 which represents an increase of 4,639,112 people compared to 2013. According to data made available by Statista, the country’s population increased to 181,137,448 in 2015 when President Muhammadu Buhari assumed office and currently stands at 212,568,404 in 2021.  Meanwhile, in a bid to improve agricultural finance in Nigeria, the federal government (FG) has introduced different financing initiatives, and between 2018 and 2020 committed over half a trillion naira in budgetary allocation to Nigeria’s agriculture sector.  However, most of the budgetary allocation to the sector in the period of three years have been for capital items. This is to say the agricultural sector has been underfunded.  This, among other factors, has greatly affected food production in the country.  With a very large population size as stated, Nigerian farmers, to a large extent, lack the capital and technological advancement to produce the bulk of food needs in Nigeria. A report by the FAO stated that only 57percent of the 6.7 million metric tons of rice consumed in Nigeria annually is locally produced leading to a deficit of about 3 million metric tons, which is either imported or smuggled into the country illegally.  Meanwhile, animal production has remained underexploited. It stated that domestic demands for livestock outweighs supply as livestock mostly reared by farm families in Nigeria are the small ruminants like goats (76 million), sheep (43.4million), and cattle (18.4 million).  According to the world bank, the food production index in Nigeria for 2018 stood at 101.9. Recent data from the United States Department of Commerce further showed that Nigeria still depends on approximately 1.7 MMT of imported parboiled rice to meet its domestic rice consumption demand. Despite his promise of improving security, Nigeria has experienced more insecurity since Buhari came to power in 2015. The Global Terrorism Index (2019) ranked Nigeria as the third-worst nation prone to terrorism with no improvement since 2017. Nobel Laureate Wole Soyinka has described the country as a war zone and the Sultan of Sokoto recently said northern Nigeria is the worst place to live in the country. One of the areas worst hit by the insecurity situation is the agriculture sector as several farmers have become internally displaced persons (IDPs), thereby causing a spike in food prices. A study shows perennial cases of farmer-herders clashes, banditry and kidnappings have made many farmers to flee their farmlands due to fear of attacks by bandits or being kidnapped after which a ransom is demanded.  Another major factor responsible for food hike in Nigeria is inflation. Since Buhari came into power in 2015, there has been sustained inflation in the country which has continued to make it difficult for many, particularly low-income earners, to eke out a living. Since the inception of the Buhari administration, this staple food item has continued with an unsteady price as Nigerian households struggle to feed. Interestingly, in 2015, a bag of rice was sold at N8,700, however by 2016, with the high rate of inflation, a 50kg bag of rice sold for N16,857. As of October 2017, the same value costs N18,000, the price was stable through 2018 in some parts of the country. In 2019, the same bag of rice sold for N25,500, by 2020, a naira metrics report revealed that a 50kg bag of rice was sold for N26,125. In 2021, the average price of a 50kg bag of imported rice goes for N28, 000 based on market surveys.  For instance, inflationary pressures have never abated since the Buhari administration announced a shutdown of Nigeria’s porous land borders with all neighbours in October 2019 in a move seeking to spur mass production of food as well as curb smuggling and associated corruption.  Similarly, the poor performance of the Naira on the currency market, coupled with its devaluation, impacted the demand and supply of food. With food demand outweighing production,  food prices steadily rose. Furthermore, the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic contributed to an increase in the food index to the tune of 22 percent, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics.  The country fell into its deepest recession in forty years during the height of pandemic restrictions, according to a report by the World Bank.  The report stated that the Nigerian economy shrank by 1.8%, as the COVID-19 crisis drove the economic slowdown. In a report by Guardian, farmers have narrated how they bribe bandits and herdsmen in their locality to enable them to go to farm unhindered and to ensure cows don’t enter their farms. It would be recalled that in August 2019, just three months after celebrating its signing the AfCFTA, Nigeria slapped a ban on the movement of all goods from countries with which it shares a land border: Benin, Niger and Cameroon, effectively banning all trade—import and export—with its neighbors. According to the president, the purpose was to curb smuggling of goods such as rice, tomatoes and poultry to encourage the production and consumption of homegrown food. But the policy is said to have contributed to the high cost of food items in the country as citizens experience widespread hunger.  According to a survey by Statista, the greatest majority of Nigerian households experienced an increase in the prices of essential food items, as over 87% of households said the prices of beans, cassava, yam and sorghum shot higher since January 2020.  It added that about 79 percent of respondents said the prices of rice increased over the same time span and 74 percent found onion more expensive than it used to be. A similar Food Survey conducted by Dataphyte in March shows that Nigerians witnessed an average of 66.8% increase in the prices of food items between last year February, the month the first case of Coronavirus was confirmed, and March 2021, when the survey was conducted.  The analysis of the prices of foodstuffs across 13 states in the country showed that the food price situation had contracted the purchasing power of citizens. In May, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) warned that at least 9.2 million Nigerians face a crisis or worse levels of food insecurity this year because of the country’s conflicts. As a Guardian report puts it, “rising insecurity, misdirection of government funds to the agricultural sector, and poor implementation of interventions by the federal government have been identified as the leading causes of hike in food prices in the country. “Other causes include multiple taxations on inter-state food transportation by federal, state, and local governments.” Additionally, low level of mechanisation and poor research and development activities as well as adverse weather conditions resulting from climate change contribute to the hike in food prices in Nigeria.  The president’s claim that middlemen are responsible for hikes in food prices in Nigeria is misleading. The hike in food prices in Nigeria cannot be tied to middlemen alone as the president has claimed. The foregoing research has shown that while there might be cases of individual middlemen hoarding essential commodities, as claimed by the president, other important factors contribute substantially to increase in the prices of food items in the country.

"Claim: A Twitter blog claimed that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) asked women in Anambra to avoid using make-up on November 6, when the state’s gubernatorial election will be held.","As the Anambra elections scheduled for November 6 draws near, several information have been circulating regarding the readiness of INEC to ensure a successful election. Aside from the fears expressed over the safety of voters due to the rate of insecurity in the region, INEC said the body had successfully implemented 12 out of 14 activities in the timetable and schedule of activities for the election including the provision of non-sensitive materials for the governorship election. A Twitter blog, Naija PR on 17th of October made a post on its Twitter handle explaining that INEC had informed Anambra women to avoid using make-up on Election Day.  The post reads: “INEC has told Anambra women to avoid using make-up on Election Day.” The post, which had garnered over 700 retweets, was greeted with doubts from some people who expressed reservations about the accuracy of the report.  Despite this, so many other Twitter users and pages shared the same information on their timelines with the same piece of information.  Other news outlets also reported the news as seen here, here and here.   Findings by Dubawa showed that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) indeed asked women coming to cast their votes during the 2021 Anambra State Governorship election to avoid using make-up on the election day.  In a report on several credible news platforms—as seen here and here—, the INEC State Deputy Director, Gender Desk, Chika Osuji, gave the directive on October 17 in Awka. Osuji had attributed the development to the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) that the agency would deploy to capture voters’ faces during the poll. Osuji had said “The BVAS will be used during the Anambra gubernatorial election to enable voters to use their fingerprints during accreditation at the polling units. “I know many women may not be able to engage makeup artists due to restriction of movements; but for those who can’t do without makeups, we appeal to you to minimise the level of the painting. If we can’t read your fingerprints we can read your face, and if we cannot read your face, you are not a registered voter, and we will not allow you to participate.” Explaining the BVAS, Barrister Festus Okoye, INEC National Commissioner and Chairman Information and Voter Education Committee said the system uses fingerprints or facials for efficient voter accreditation. In situations where the fingerprint of the voter fails, the face of the voter will be captured to allow them cast their votes.  However, if there are heavy makeovers, the person may not be identified.  A civil society organisation which also serves as an election observer during the Isoko South State Assembly Constituency bye-election in Delta State had earlier hailed the initiative, saying the BVAS will reduce human interference in the electoral process. It further described it as a robust and efficient way to guarantee the credibility of the voter accreditation and result management process to promote transparent elections. The claim that INEC advised female voters to avoid using make-up on election day is true. Findings by Dubawa showed that this is due to the BVAS system that will be deployed.

Claim: Some online media claim that embattled DCP Abba Kyari’’s suspension has been lifted.,"Recently, some online media have posted that embattled DCP Abba Kyari has been told to go back to work as the Inspector General of Police,IGP Usman Alkali Baba, has lifted his suspension. According to one of the posts made by WEETALKNAIJA, Abba Kyari has been reinstated back into the police force. It added that ‘the information was revealed by one of Abba Kyari‘s loyalists who is also a police officer under the IRT department of the police force. The post further made reference to an Instagram post by faithentertainments_showbiz tagged ‘Suspension Lifted.’ An Instagram user, goldmynetv, also made a post tagging it “wild jubilations as police hierarchy gives suspended DCP and Hushpuppi’s Associate,Abba Kyari, the green light to resume duty as an officer.” The post which has been deleted had 1,779 likes. Further checks also showed that online news sites like tpdelmedia and Globatimesng made posts on the same claim. On October 28, 2021, the inspector general of police IGP Usman Alkali Baba revealed he was yet to receive or see a formal extradition request for Deputy Commissioner of Police  Abba Kyari following his indictment by a U.S court. It would be recalled that Kyari had earlier in the year been accused of being a conspirator in a 1.1 million dollar fund deal involving Instagram celebrity Ramon Abbas, popularly known as Hushpuppi. While investigations continued, the embattled police officer was suspended and the IGP appointed Deputy Commissioner of Police, Tunji Disu, as head of the police intelligence response team (IRT). About a month ago, Minister of police affairs, Muhammadu Maigairi Dingyadi, while confirming that investigations have been concluded and findings submitted, noted that President Muhammadu Buhari will have the final consideration on the matter. So was Abba Kyari’s suspension lifted as claimed in the post? When contacted, the Police Public Relations Officer, PPRO, CP Frank Mba, said the claim is false as Abba Kyari’s suspension has not been lifted. This researcher further verified the image used to depict the celebration of the embattled police officer’s suspension being lifted. It was discovered that the photograph was actually taken when Abba Kyari and the IRT team celebrated the capture and the arrest of kidnapper Chukwudi Onuamadike aka “Evans”. The claim that the embattled DCP Abba Kyari’s suspension has been lifted is false. ",FALSE,02/11/2021,https://dubawa.org/false-abba-kyaris-suspension-not-lifted/
Claim: FG debited money paid to resident doctors to suspend strike,"Claim: FG debited money paid to resident doctors to suspend strike The claim that the FG debited allowance paid to resident doctors to call off strike is true. Full Text A twitter user The Bearded Dr Sina (@thebearded_sina) tweeted on October 13, 2021 that the federal government is debiting resident doctors across the country for the allowance initially paid to them to call off their recent strike. He wrote, “The Federal Government did the unthinkable to NIgerian resident doctors. “Part of the demand for the strike to be called off was to make some payments for residency training, after some payments were made. “FG started debiting people and removing money from people’s accounts, the same amount that was paid was removed” he posted. The tweets within two hours of its posting garnered about 563 likes, 634 retweets and 167 quoted tweets.  Screenshot of the tweet The National Association of Resident Doctors (NARD) had commenced an indefinite strike across the country on Monday, August 2, 2021. This action followed a directive issued on July 31, 2021 at the end of the executive meeting of the National Executive Council (NEC) of the union held in Umuahia, the Abia State capital. This disclosure was made by the National President of NARD, Dr Okhuaihesuyi Uyilawa, while briefing the press after the meeting, where he announced that members have been asked to proceed on a nationwide indefinite industrial action.  According to the Union’s president, “We are embarking on a total and indefinite strike on August 2, 2021. You can recall we had a memorandum of action on March 31, 2021, and had an addendum to it on April 9, and since then, we still have had irregularities in the payment of salaries to the house officers. “We had issues with them being non-regular payment and as part of the memorandum of action, it was said that they should be captured back into the IPPS platform,” he added. During the strike, there was disagreement between the striking doctors and the federal  government over the arrears of salaries owed. The Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige, while speaking at the opening of the meeting of the Presidential Committee on Salaries with the leadership of the Joint Health Sector Union (JOHESU) in Abuja on September 6, 2021, more than a month after the strike began, has said that contrary to what he described as propaganda by the striking members of the National Association of Resident Doctors (NARD), no doctor or health worker in Nigeria is owed their monthly salary. According to the minister, the “fumes from the propaganda machine of NARD were obfuscating the reality of the Federal Government’s efforts to re-position the health sector.” “NARD goes about telling Nigerians that the government is owing them salaries and that the government is not taking the problems in the health sector seriously. But this is not true. It is incorrect. No doctor, nurse, pharmacist or any other health worker including the driver is owed monthly salary. Government pays as and when due,” Ngige was quoted as saying in a statement by the Ministry’s Deputy Director Press and Public Relations, Charles Akpan. Despite a series of meetings between the Federal Government and the striking doctors, no resolution has been reached. While the Federal Government insists that the demands of the doctors have been met, the doctors insist otherwise. Some of the issues raised by the medical practitioners include the immediate payment of all salaries owed to all house officers, including March salaries (regardless of quota system) before the end of business on March 31. They are also asking for an upward review of the Hazard Allowance to 50 percent of consolidated basic salaries of all health workers and payment of the outstanding COVID-19 inducement allowance, especially in state-owned-tertiary institutions. The Minister of Labour and Employment had in the wake of the disagreements threatened to invoke the “no-work, no pay” rule on NARD. But the NMA has thrown its weight behind striking doctors and other health workers. “The truth is that NARD doctors fail to tell Nigerians that their colleagues who are owed salaries are the ones illegally recruited and were therefore neither captured by the Office of the Head of Service of the Federation nor were their payments provided for by the Budget Office of the Federation. “Monthly salaries are done as and when due for those legitimately employed by the Federal Government but not to those illegally employed and who need their appointments regularized and captured in the finances of the government for payment. This takes a process which is not accomplished overnight.” The strike was finally called off on October 4, 2021 via a communique signed by the Nigerian Medical Association, Secretary-General Ekpe Philips Uche, after the meeting held among delegates of NMA and NARD  in Abuja, where the NMA advised NARD to stop the ongoing industrial action. At the meeting, NMA mandated the National Officers Committee, NOC, to ensure the implementation of the memorandum of understanding signed with the federal government on August 21. The doctors’ strike was on for nine weeks, crippling activities in public tertiary hospitals across the country, leaving patients stranded. Responding to an enquiry about the claim from Dubawa, the Chairman of the National Association of Resident Doctors of University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital branch, Dr Badmus Habeeb, confirmed the claim to be true.  “It’s true we are being debited. However, the reason they gave was that they paid some of us wrongly using a list that was not updated. Hence, they paid some doctors who have left the system. They claimed once they recoup all the funds in our accounts, “they will now use the appropriate list”, he stated. The Assistant General Secretary of the branch, Dr Anaduaka Christopher Obinna, confirms while corroborating the claim that about 50 members of the union were affected including him. He said that in his own case, he had used the money paid into his account, but when the deduction started, he saw his account in the negative. This means that any money that comes into the account is automatically deducted until full pay back. He added,“They (National body) are currently meeting with the federal government. And the Head of Service of the federation says everyone will be debited because a wrong list was used. “The official list approved by NARD and the National Post Graduate College unfortunately  was not used, for reasons best known to them.” Speaking in the same vein, the Secretary of the Nigeria Medical Association Kwara State Chapter, Dr. Tijani Rasheed, stated that the union in the state is aware of the incident. According to him, “You are aware the NMA at the National level was involved in ensuring that resident doctors suspend their strike, so when the doctors start getting debit alerts they inform us and the National body is meeting the government to ensure the mistakes are corrected.” Conclusion Given the evidence available, the claim that the Federal Government debited resident doctors across the country for the allowance initially paid to them to call off their recent strike is true.

Claim: A viral Social media Press Release claims Dr. Sylvia Blyden has been appointed as Minister of Information.,"A press release claiming to have emerged from the office of the president in Sierra Leone indicates opposition politician Dr. Sylvia Olayinka Blyden has been appointed by the president as the nation’s new “Minister of Information and Broadcasting.” The press release dated 20th October, 2021 bears the “Office of the President- State House” stamp and the signature of press secretary to the president and government spokesperson Yusuf Keketoma Sandy and has been shared on WhatsApp and Facebook. This also saw another fake release re-surfaced claiming the Chairman of the ruling SLPP-Prince Harding has been appointed as the nation’s vice president. This came in a recent affidavit filed by Dr Sylvia Olayinka Blyden to the High Court of Sierra Leone presenting a case against some top politicians of the opposition All People’s Congress Party of which she is a senior member. Amongst the top APC leadership in Blyden’s affidavit is her former boss and former president of the Republic of Sierra Leone, Ernest Bai Koroma, to whom she served as Special Executive Assistant (SEA) and later Minister of Social Welfare, Gender and Children’s Affairs.  In the affidavit presented to the court, Blyden is asking for 25 orders to be granted by the court but the ultimate desire of her case is “to preempt any step that will lead to the APC losing its registration.”  A media officer at the State House, Mr. Lamin Sheriff, told Dubawa that the release is fake. We reached out to Mr. Sheriff via WhatsApp for verification and his short response was “Fake.”  Furthermore, Dubawa conducted some internet searches on the social media handles of the office of the president and the press secretary who in most cases unveils new political and national appointments  but there was no such announcement.  The press release mentioned “Ministry of Information and Broadcasting,” but there is no such ministry under the current government.

Claim: Facebook users claim a picture of a man lying on a dilapidated hospital bed was taken at the Bo Government hospital in Southern Sierra Leone.,"A photo has surfaced on Facebook of a man lying down and receiving IV fluid in a bed without a mattress and bed sheets in what looks like a hospital ward. This has been shared several times by social media users saying the picture was taken at the Bo Government Hospital in Southern Sierra Leone.   “Bo government hospital, Salone just pray God make u no sick bcus na d hospital de help for kill u now,” a post read.  This is interpreted as “Sierra Leone you should pray you don’t get sick cause the hospital will aid your death.” Dubawa attempted to trace the origin of the image by using Yandex Reverse Image search which revealed that the picture has been shared several times and goes as far back as 2019. It is believed to have first appeared in 2019 in Nigeria and has been previously fact-checked.  Since its appearance online, it has not been linked just to Sierra Leone but also to Congo Brazzaville,  Kenya, and even Nigeria.   The image has been used numerous times either as claims or rebuttals as shown by Yandex Reverse Image Search  Some of the comments in the search conducted above state that the man in the hospital is at a referral hospital in Homabay, a town on the south shore of Winam Gulf of Lake Victoria, in western Kenya, others say it is the current state of hospitals in Nigeria.  However, for further clarification, Dubawa visited the Bo Government Hospital situated in the heart of the city to further verify the said image.  “The said photo is fake and has no semblance to any of the wards in this hospital,” says Staff Thereza Gbassay Moriba the In-charge of Ward 7 for both male & female wards at the Bo Government Hospital in Southern Sierra Leone. “People just want to make issues out of nothing as well as sabotage the effort they are making to upkeep the facility.” Dubawa went ahead to take a snapshot of the current ward housing Bed 18 at the Bo hospital with Bed 18 written on the white Paper on the wall indicating the Bed number. From the findings and presentations above, it is untrue that the image in circulation was taken at a hospital in Bo City Southern part of Sierra Leone.

"Claim: The image of an ongoing construction of a house on a rail line was shared by a Facebook user, BuzzeeMo claiming that a resident of Potiskum in Yobe State was building a house on a rail line.","On October 5th 2021, a Facebook user, BuzzeeMo, which identifies itself as a news/media company, shared the image of an ongoing house construction on a railway line with the claim that the ongoing building is in Potiskum in Yobe State, north east of Nigeria. The Facebook post which received mixed reactions from other users generated 127 comments. Though some users had alleged that the image was not taken in Nigeria but in Zambia, it nevertheless was shared 153 times. BuzzeeMo captioned the image: “A resident of Potiskum town in Yobe State built his house on a rail track.” He further stated below the text, “Nigerians and cruise.” In the image, a building is under construction in the middle of a railway line. There is a yellow and red kiosk by the right side while a lady in a red and white floral dress backing the camera leans on the kiosk.  Potiskum town is in Yobe State and is one of the 17 local government areas of the state. The town of Potiskum has been described as a thriving trading centre in Yobe and the northeast region of Nigeria. People from neighbouring Borno, Jigawa, Kano, Bauchi and Gombe states as well as numerous others from Niger, Chad, Cameroon, Benin and Central African Republic are said to have stakes in the ‘biggest cattle market in sub-Saharan Africa,’ which is situated in Potiskum. Situated in the north east and with Yobe sharing borders with Borno State, Potiskum has witnessed its own share of insecurity associated with Boko Haram. A suicide bombing at a Shia march in Potiskum in 2014 had killed 15 people while another suicide bombing at a secondary school caused the death of over 40 students in November of the same year. There have been several other attacks that have rocked the town of Potiskum. A Google Reverse Image Search of the image showed the photograph had appeared numerous times on the internet starting from September 2021. Further checks revealed that most of the posts in relation to the image came from Kenyans who posted the image and questioned why the Kenya Railway Corporation was yet to do something about it. The image had hit the Kenyan cyberspace on September 29th 2021 and shortly went viral. However, following reactions from Kenyans as to why the country’s Railway Corporation had failed to reclaim its lines, the Kenyan Railway Corporation had issued a statement of warning to the contractor undertaking the housing project. It stated that it would soon embark on reclaiming its lands and that no one should complain when such a time comes. The Kenyan Railway Corporation also urged the contractor to stop further construction and pull down the structure.  Google Reverse Image Search shows the image trended in September 2021 with most of the posters linking it to Kenya Nigeria’s railway lines have been in existence for over a century. Its history goes as far back as 1898 when the British Colonial Government constructed the first railroad. However, what is today referred to as Nigerian railways came into being on October 3rd 1912 when the Lagos Colony Railway and the Baro-Kano Railway were amalgamated.  When the colonial administration constructed the railway lines, it was to enable it to evacuate minerals and agricultural raw materials and forest resources from the interior parts of the country and also to enable the selling of imported manufactured goods in these interior locations. The rail lines have succeeded in linking up the different regions of the country and for promoting inter-regional trade as well as increasing industrial and economic development. The railway network runs diagonally from Lagos in the south west to Nguru,Yobe State in the north east and from Port Harcourt in the south-south through Kafanchan in Kaduna State in the north west to Maiduguri in the north east. Despite being one of the modern and safest means of transportation, not much has been achieved in terms of expanding Nigeria’s rail lines since 1964 except for the 277 kilometers standard gauge rail line project under construction between Itakpe via Ajaokuta to Warri which was commissioned by President Muhammadu Buhari in 2020. This is why immediately the Federal Government approved the award of contracts for the rehabilitation and and reconstruction of the Port-Harcourt-Maiduguri eastern narrow gauge line in 2020, some stakeholders from Potiskum wrote to President Muhammadu Buhari seeking the inclusion of Potiskum in the proposed rail project.   The proposed project which will link Gashua, Damaturu in Yobe State did not include Potiskum which has one of the largest cattle markets not only in Nigeria but West Africa. The letter signed by the Head of Yerman Gudi community, Idriss Madu on behalf of other stakeholders, stated that Potiskum town has the largest grains market in Nigeria and the largest fleet of Transport, including heavy duty vehicles and is a vital link to four state capitals including Bauchi, Damaturu, Gombe, Dutse and therefore it was important to call the president’s attention to the “obvious neglect of the strategic town in the proposed rail line.” When this reporter contacted the Nigerian Railway Corporation on the veracity of the image in circulation, the Deputy Director, Public Relations, Mr. Mahmud Yakub categorically said “there is no railway line in Potiskum.” This is a hint that the image could not have been taken in Potiskum. Mr Yakub, however, directed this reporter to the PRO, Railway Property Management Company Limited, Gloria Binda Zinass for further details on the matter.   When contacted, Zinnas stated that the company had come in contact with the same image with a different claim. She said after investigations, all the six zonal and six area offices of the Railway Property Management Company had revealed that such a scenario does not exist anywhere in Nigeria.  Findings show that the image, though authentic, was used in a misleading context as the incident did not occur in Potiskum, Yobe State or anywhere in Nigeria.

Claim: A Twitter user claims that a woman’s brain shrinks during pregnancy and needs up to six months to grow back to its normal size.,"A woman’s body image is a psychological representation of her body comprising her attitudes and self-perceptions of her appearance, stemming from biological, psychological, and social influences. It can be significantly affected by the rapid and extensive physical changes during pregnancy. This is just as a woman’s body experiences several transformations during pregnancy. Some of these physical changes are visible, such as an expanding belly and weight gain, while others are well known, such as an enlarged uterus, morning sickness, and backaches. The changes experienced during pregnancy could range from: -Frequent urination. -Lightheadedness.  –Constipation. -Skin changes.  -Breast changes.  -Vaginal changes. -A growing belly. -Emotional symptoms. However, a recent claim that women’s brains shrink during pregnancy went viral on social media, especially WhatsApp. The claim was made by UberFacts (@UberFacts) and has garnered over 656 retweets and 4,067 likes as of October 21, 2021. Pregnancy begins when the developing embryo implants in the endometrial lining of a woman’s uterus. Most pregnant women do not have any specific signs or symptoms after implantation, although it is not uncommon to experience minimal bleeding. A number of early medical signs are associated with pregnancy. These signs typically appear, if at all, within the first few weeks after conception. Not all of these signs are universally present, nor are all of them diagnostic by themselves; taken together, they may make a presumptive diagnosis of pregnancy. However, the effects of pregnancy on the human brain are virtually unknown. Ageing causes changes to brain size, vasculature, and cognition. The brain shrinks with increasing age and there are changes at all levels from molecules to morphology. The effects of ageing on the brain and cognition are widespread and have multiple aetiologies. Ageing has its effects on the molecules, cells, vasculature, gross morphology, and cognition. As the brains shrink in volume, particularly in the frontal cortex and as the vasculature ages and blood pressure rises, the possibility of stroke and ischemia increases and the white matter develops lesions. According to a report, it is completely normal to experience changes in one’s brain as one ages. The cerebral cortex, which is the wrinkled outer layer of the brain, gets thinner as one ages. It’s particularly noticeable in the frontal lobe, which processes memory, emotions, impulse control, problem-solving, social interaction, and motor function. Thinning can also be noticeable in parts of the temporal lobe, which is located behind the ears and helps people understand words, speak, read, write, and connect words with their meanings. The parts of the brain that shrink contain important nerve fibers, which are tube-like structures that carry information from the brain to the rest of the body and from the body back to the spinal cord and brain.  When the brain shrinks, there are fewer connections between neurons, and the neurotransmitter systems that communicate information from the brain to different parts of the body change, resulting in numerous complications. So, does a woman’s brain shrink during pregnancy? Head, Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Mother and Child Hospital, Ondo State, Dr. Ayodele Adewole, said there is no truth in the claim that a woman’s brain shrinks when pregnant. According to him, ‘there is no truth in it at all, nothing can be farther from the truth than that. It is an absolute falsehood. The brain does not shrink in size, it is only its function that reduces with age and pregnancy has nothing to do with the brain.’  In addition, Chief Medical Director of the University of  Medical Science (UNIMED) Teaching Hospital, Ondo, Dr. Adesina Akintan said the claim has not been proven yet scientifically. ‘I am not aware of the claim that a woman’s brain shrinks when pregnant and needs up to six months to fully grow back to its size, and as such, I don’t agree with such a verdict because it is not scientific,’ he said. A study published in Nature Neuroscience posits that substantial changes occur in a woman’s brain during pregnancy, adding that the brain gets smaller and it also makes itself more efficient. According to the study, these changes prepare an expectant mother for parenthood. However, another study, reveals that the architecture of women’s brains changes strikingly during their first pregnancies, in ways that last for at least 2 years. This may mean that new mothers’ brains are more efficiently wired in areas that allow them, for instance, to respond to their infant’s needs or to detect threats to children in their environments.  It adds that Gray matter volume loss can also represent a beneficial process of maturation or specialization. Although some studies have started emerging on this claim, there is, however, insufficient evidence to prove that a woman’s brain shrinks during pregnancy and needs up to six months after giving birth to grow back to its normal size.

Shisha, also known as Hookah, nargile, or hubble bubble are water pipes that are used to smoke specifically made tobacco mixtures that come in a wide variety of flavours. It can come in different flavours such as apple, mint, cherry, chocolate, coconut, licorice, cappuccino, and watermelon. These flavours often make the smoke smell sweet and are usually heated by burning wood, coal or charcoal. Most smokers often perceive shisha to be less harmful than smoking cigarettes, but studies show that the smoke contains many of the same toxic components found in cigarette smoke. Constituents of shisha smoke include; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), volatile aldehydes, CO, nitric oxide (NO), nicotine, furans, and nanoparticles.  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, people who smoke shisha may be at risk for some of the same diseases cigarette smoking induces, such as: Oral cancer Lung cancer Stomach cancer Cancer of the esophagus Reduced lung function Decreased fertility. Breast cancer is a disease in which cells in the breast grow out of control. Breast cancer cells usually form a tumour that can often be seen on an x-ray or felt as a lump. The breast is made up of lobes and ducts. Each breast has 15 to 20 sections called lobes. Each lobe has many smaller sections called lobules. The most common type of breast cancer is ductal carcinoma, which starts from the cells of the ducts.  Cancer that begins in the lobes or lobules is called lobular carcinoma and is more often found in both breasts than are other types of breast cancer while inflammatory breast cancer is an uncommon type of breast cancer in which the breast is warm, red and swollen. Breast cancer happens when the cells in the breast grow and divide in an uncontrolled way, thereby creating a mass of tissue called a tumor. Cells in the body normally divide only when new cells are needed. Sometimes, the cells could grow out of control, while the cells are normal, then the tumour is termed benign (non-cancerous). However, if the cells growing out of control are abnormal then the tumour is termed malignant (cancerous). Consultant radiation and clinical Oncologist with the University of medical science and teaching hospital, Ondo, (UNIMEDTH), Dr. Ndidi Okunnuga, said exposing a woman to smoking shisha really does cause breast cancer. She said’ Anything tobacco exposes a woman to cancer, and so that claim is correct. Anything that has the origin of tobacco exposes a woman to the risk of breast cancer. There are so many risk factors of cancer and one of them is tobacco smoking.’ ‘So, in whatever form either cigarette, ‘taba’, shisha as long as it is tobacco, has a very high risk of causing breast cancer,’she added. A Consultant Oncologist Dr. Ebere Okereke, said there is no direct link between shisha smoking and breast cancer.  According to her, ‘a session of shisha however delivers over 100 times the smoke from a regular cigarette, with its toxic chemicals. This can predispose to a host of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases as well as cancers (of the lung, mouth, etc.) in the long run. Shisha is generally not as innocuous as it’s marketed to be.’ A medical practitioner, Dr. Wilson Thomas Ikubese, said the claim is partially true, although it depends on the individual’s genetic predisposition to breast cancer. Dr. Ikubese said ‘smoking generally is not good for the health, it primarily affects the lungs and it could secondarily affect other parts of the body. And in terms of breast cancer, it is primarily a predisposition of the individual. There are genes one carries that predisposes them to develop breast cancer, so one cannot say it is totally wrong.’ ‘The gene for breast cancer must be there, for it to surface, however, if it isn’t, then such person can smoke and not have breast cancer. So, those who start smoking much earlier and have a genetic predisposition for breast cancer can eventually come up with it,’ he added. According to a report by the  World Health Organization WHO, avoidance of exposure to tobacco smoke is part of interventions that can reduce the risk of breast cancer. However, the report reveals that even if all of the potentially modifiable risk factors could be controlled, this would only reduce the risk of developing breast cancer by at most 30%. The claim that avoiding shisha could reduce the risk of breast cancer is partially true. It, however, depends on one’s genetic predisposition to breast cancer. A woman can also have breast cancer when the cancerous cells move from the primary site of cancer (lung/mouth)- due to smoking,  to the breast.

"Claim: A Twitter user claimed that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) was yet to commence distribution of permanent voters cards (PVCs), days to the 2021 Anambra governorship election.","Claim: A Twitter user claimed that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) was yet to commence distribution of permanent voters cards (PVCs), days to the 2021 Anambra governorship election. True. INEC is yet to commence distribution of permanent voters cards in Anambra State for the 2021 governorship election. As the race for who becomes the next governor of Anambra State draws near, Nigerians have continued to express concerns over the safety of voters, owing to the rising spate of insecurity in the state, occasioned allegedly by the activities of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB).  The separatist group has been linked to recent violent attacks across the state, targeting private citizens, security agents, and even government parastatals, including the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), whose state office in Awka was attacked in May 2021. Office blocks, vehicles and vital election materials were destroyed in the attack, further setting back preparations and creating doubts over the possibility of the conduct of the November 6 elections. One of such concerns was recently re-echoed by a Twitter user, Ifeanyichukwu (@OgbajiIfeanyi), in a series of posts. He claimed that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) had not started distribution of permanent voters cards to registered voters in the state, with just a few days left until the election, calling into question the preparedness of INEC to conduct the elections. “23 days to Anambra elections, but @inecnigeria is yet to start distribution of PVC after CVR. Na Tinubu Portfolio we go take vote?” he tweeted, attaching a photo of former senator and ex-governor of Lagos, Bola Tinubu and Nigeria’s president, Muhammadu Buhari,” the tweet reads. The user who has over eight thousand followers also tweeted: “20days to Anambra elections, but @inecnigeria is yet to start distribution of PVC after CVR.. @PoliceNG don already map out 35k officers and 2 Helicopters, na Biafran war?!”, in addition to other tweets, here and here. @VoterEduNG, a handle dedicated to voter education in Nigeria also shared a similar tweet: “Anambra State Gubernatorial election  is 21 DAYS  away. Reports say 1.2 million were registered during the CVR. @inecnigeria is yet to start distribution of PVC. How are Anambra residents supposed to vote ?. @NewsWireNGR @ConstitutionLab @nassnigeria #VoterApathy @OgbajiIfeanyi.” Findings by Dubawa showed that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) had not abandoned plans to conduct the 2021 Anambra State Governorship election, despite the uncertainty over the election. Dispelling rumours of rescheduling the election, the INEC Chairman, Mahmood Yakubu, who spoke at an emergency meeting of the Inter-Agency Consultative Committee on Election Security (ICCES) in October, assured that the election will not be postponed. “From the reports we have received, the stated goal of many of the attackers is that the governorship election scheduled for 6 November 2021 must not hold,” Yakubu said. However, to forestall this plan, Mr Yakubu noted that the commission will continue to work closely with security agencies, respected opinion leaders in Anambra State and the National Peace Committee, to ensure that these attacks “do not derail the electoral process.” “To underscore this determination, the commission is implementing two more activities on the Timetable for the election in the next few days. The register of voters will be presented to political parties in Awka on Thursday 7 October 2021. On the same day, the commission will publish the final list of candidates for the election,” he said. Festus Okoye, INEC’s National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee (IVEC), revealed in a statement that the Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) will also be ready for collection on or shortly after October 7, 2021. “The PVCs of the new registrants will be ready for collection on or shortly after October 7. While INEC has published the final list of candidates for the election and presented the register of voters to the political parties – two activities also scheduled for October 7, findings by Dubawa revealed that the commission was yet to resume the collection of Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) in the state.  As at October 21, 2021, two weeks after October 7 slated for the commencement of the process, registered voters had not started collecting their PVCs. Speaking with Dubawa, Nonso Okafor, a resident of Obosi, said the exercise had not commenced. “I have not collected my PVC and I have not received any email from them so far. The last time I went there they said we should come back,” he said. Another resident, Austin Nze, noted that while the collection of PVCs had not commenced, a lot of people are not interested in the process due to the current security challenges in the state. “There’s just this apathy and indifference in the state, which I can understand, given the Awka and Anambra situation, and the whole IPOB issue,” he said. “Given that, it is not exactly the safest place to be, and everyone here just has that intention of staying low during the election.” When Dubawa contacted, Festus Okoye, INEC’s National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee (IVEC), restated the commitment of the commission to conduct the election as planned, adding that the PVCs for newly registered voters were currently being printed and will soon be ready for collection. “We are printing the PVCs presently. We have their (voters) telephone numbers and email addresses. The moment their PVCs are ready, we will send emails to them and text messages and call them by phone and they will come and pick their PVCs.  “Everybody who registered and really wants to vote will get their PVCs at least a week before the election,” he said. The claim that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has not commenced the distribution of Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) is true. Findings by Dubawa showed that two weeks after the date given by INEC for the commencement of the collection of PVCs, the commission was yet to commence the exercise. However, INEC told Dubawa that the printing of PVCs was currently ongoing and would be ready for collection by voters, at least a week before the election.

Claim: Multiple social media users claimed that a Nigeria Customs Service officer in a recent viral video is one of the repentant bandits “recruited” into the security forces in the country.,"Nwaiwu Chiukwuebuka, a Facebook user, in a post on Saturday, October 16, had shared pictures of a Nigeria Customs Service officer and that of a supposedly repentant bandit. According to him, the officer is one of the repentant bandits recruited to a significant security force in the country. He also raised an alarm that members of Boko Haram are “being recruited into the Nigeria Army, Nigeria Police and other Nigeria security bodies.” Chiukwuebuka, whose Facebook bio reads “Protest writer and a patriotic unapologetic Biafran,” wrote: “From Bandit to Nigeria custom Officer, same way Boko Haram is being recruited into the Nigeria Army, Nigeria Police and other Nigeria security bodies.” The post, spurious as it appears, was widely shared, with 344 reshares and 24 reactions amassed as of Tuesday, October 19.  Using the Crowdtangle web extension, a  further check showed that another Facebook user with over 22,000 followers, Chinasa, Nworu, shared the picture. Nworu, whose Facebook profile showed that he works at “Radio Biafra,”  shared the post on October 16, and it amassed 2,100 shares, 126 comments and 294 reactions. In the same vein on Twitter, a user with username @hashtag2weet with over 6,000 followers also shared the picture on Sunday, October 17. Findings by Dubawa also revealed that many WhatsApp users have re-shared the photo. Banditry, over recent times, has presented itself in forms of organised crimes including kidnapping, cattle rustling, mass abduction, arson, and armed robbery. The security record in Nigeria showed that it began as a farmer-herder crisis in some states in northeast Nigeria like Zamfara, Katsina and Kaduna, where it was first treated as a local affair. Triggered by poverty and a break of leadership trust, banditry in Nigeria has festered into what appears like full-blown terrorism, with its activities climaxed by the recent shooting of a military fighter jet. According to ACAPS, a non-profit, non-governmental project providing international, independent humanitarian analysis, between March 2020 and June 2021, over 1,400 students and staff have been kidnapped in several school abductions reported in northwest Nigeria.  These abductions took place in Kankara and Mahuta (Katsina state), Kagara and Tegina (Niger state), Jangebe and Maradun (Zamfara state), Mando, Afaka, and Kasarami (Kaduna state), and Birnin Yauri (Kebbi state). State and federal governments have been taking some bold steps to eradicate banditry, including a special package for repentant bandits. Like Operation Safe Corridor (OSC), Nigeria’s de-radicalisation, rehabilitation and reintegration programme for repentant Boko Haram members and bandits are promised a huge reward if they surrender their arms. In February 2021, Auwalu Daudawa, a bandit leader who masterminded the kidnapping of schoolboys in Kankara, Katsina, surrendered over 22 weapons, including sophisticated AK-47 rifles. Daudawa dropped his arms for the operative from the Zamfara police command alongside other bandits. However, he later returned to the forest to continue banditry, having been allegedly dissatisfied by the promise made to him by the government. He was tragically killed during a gun duel with a rival gang at Dumburum forest located between Zurmi local government in Zamfara and Batsari local government in Katsina. Before that, in January 2021, seven notorious bandits said they had repented and surrendered their weapons to the Zamfara state government. They offered 14 weapons including AK 47 rifles. In April 2021, the Katsina police command said four bandits “voluntarily surrendered” their weapons including AK-47 rifles. Although the suspicious surrender of bandits has been described as a leap forward in the battle against banditry, many people believe that these blood-craving criminals including Boko haram terrorists are being given a soft landing despite their documented numerous atrocities. The government officials’ colourful media parade of repentant bandits, coupled with the privileges they enjoy after dropping their weapons have since created a conspiracy theory that often lead to a whirlpool of debates on whether these criminals are being recruited into the major security forces in the country. On Thursday, September 2, the Nigerian Army announced that almost 6,000 ex-terrorists had surrendered to the government. But before the announcement, specifically in 2019, General Abdulmalik Biu, the General Officer Commanding (GOC) of the 7 Division, urged terrorists to lay down their arms. Biu said a repentant terrorist “stands to be a president of this country; he stands to aspire to any position in this country.” This statement created a fuss and fuelled the conspiracy theory about repentant terrorists being recruited into the Nigerian Army. In several defences in the past, the military force had debunked the recruitment claim and described it as false and misleading, “laced with mediocrity emanating from a poorly researched and uninformed position.” Claim 1: Are Boko Haram and bandits being recruited into the Nigerian Army? Although there are unintelligible claims that repentant bandits and Boko Haram terrorists are getting recruited into the security forces in the country, findings by Dubawa showed that they are just products of febrile imaginations of some people and mere conspiracy theories. There is no record to back it up! In December 2019, the Defence Headquarters (DHQ) dismissed the alleged recruitment of deredicalised Boko Haram ex-fighters into the Nigerian military. Onyema Nwachukwu, the acting director of defence information emphasized in a statement that “contrary to claims, no Boko Haram ex-fighter has been recruited into the Nigerian military and no such plan is in the offing. “The de-radicalisation, rehabilitation and reintegration programme is a Federal Government programme conducted under the auspices of Operation Safe Corridor as a non-kinetic operation,” he added. Similarly in August 2021, the Nigerian Army also denied that it was recruiting ex-Boko Haram fighters and bandits into the force. “For the avoidance of doubt, the NA does not have any repentant terrorists joining its ranks and does not have any plan for that. There are teaming able-bodied Nigerians that are willing to join the NA and genuinely help in the fight against terrorism and other violent crimes,” Brig-Gen Onyema Nwachukwu, director, Army public relations, said. Meanwhile, there are records that some repentant ex-terrorists are being reintegrated back into the society.  In May 2021, Nigerian Military announced that 603 repentant Boko Haram terrorists who have been rehabilitated would be reintegrated into the society in June. Claim 2: Is the Nigerian Customs Service officer in a recent viral video a repentant bandit? Verifying this claim, Dubawa ran a Yandex reverse image separately for the two collaged photos.  The first Yandex search showed Governor Aminu Masari of Katsina state ‘posing’  with some bandits who surrendered their arms. The second picture, a screenshot, was taken from a recent viral video of the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) officer hilariously saluting his superior.  The original video is found on The Punch newspaper’s Instagram page, and Nollywood actor Victor Osuagwu’s IG handle. A further search by Dubawa in respect to the first image showed that between 2019 and 2020, Governor Masari of Katsina, in a bid to lure errant youths out of banditry, met with some leaders of banditry who came to surrender their weapons.  In a report contained in Leadership newspaper, the Katsina governor was reported to have “presided over the state’s security council meeting with repentant bandits and others specifically dedicated to the contentious issues of banditry and kidnapping.” In November 2020, Masari was reported to have received two repentant bandit leaders named Sale Turwa and Muhammed Sani Maidaji at the Government House in Katsina. Dubawa used an InVID’s Keyframe tool to analyse the video where the second image was taken. The result broke the footage into six frames, showing each image clearly. The fourth frame from the result above, which looks like the one being shared in the claim, was subjected to Magnifier image analysis. Again, results showed no facial resemblance (nose, mouth and eye) between the “repentant” bandit and Customs operative mischievously shared as the same person. The two pictures being shared are different and the claim surrounding them is false and highly misleading. Besides, no record showed that ex-Boko Haram fighters and bandits are being recruited into the Nigerian Army.

"Claim: A sponsored Facebook post claims that the United Nations is offering fully funded BSc, MSc and PhD scholarships for international students to study in Canada, USA, Australia or Japan.","A post which was boosted through a Facebook sponsored ad stated that the United Nations (UN) is offering fully funded BSc, MSc and PhD scholarships for international students to study in Canada, USA, Australia or Japan.  The copy of the e-flyer used for the promotion further claims that the scholarship covers full tuition, accommodation and health insurance.  It further emphasised that all nationalities are eligible to apply as there are no agents involved and the application process is easy.  With high tuition fees, a study abroad option is unaffordable for most Nigerians.  According to research by the International Institute of Education, the average cost of studying abroad in a foreign country hovers around $18,000 per semester, or $36,000 per full academic year. As a result, many Nigerian students are on International Scholarships for African students such as the Chevening Scholarship, Commonwealth Scholarship among others, to be able to achieve their study abroad dream.   First, this fact-checker examined the Facebook Page which sponsored the claim, dubbed “Scholarship Portal,” and observed that it uses a profile picture that carries the UN logo and inscription boldly written, “UN Scholarships.”  Using the InVID verifier, a forensic examination of the image was undertaken and the result reveals a heavy double quantization (double JPEG image) that exposes the image manipulation and shows the doctored parts.  Furthermore, a google reverse image search did not associate the photo to the United Nations or any of its affiliate institutions. This is in addition to suspicious comments being posted on the page’s posts.  Verifying further, PRNigeria visited the official website of the United Nations and surfing through reveals that the UN has the United Nations Academic Impact (UNAI)  initiative that aligns institutions of higher education with the United Nations in supporting and contributing to the realization of United Nations goals and mandates, including the promotion and protection of human rights, access to education, sustainability and conflict resolution with vibrant and diverse network of students, academics, scientists, researchers, think tanks, institutions of higher education, continuing education and educational associations in over 1400 member institutions in more than 147 countries that reach over 25 million people in the education and research sectors around the world.  Under this initiative, the only scholarship information listed under the ‘scholarship and contest’ page include: Nuclear Safety Essay Competition for Students and Early Career Professionals, United Nations Access to Space for All Initiative: Fellowship Programme for “Drop Tower Experiment Series (DropTES)”, “What if – Spesterra” Youth Video Challenge, 2021 Global Media Competition on Labour Migration, and the UCL Open: Environment Calls for Papers concerned with theme of water, none of which has a correlation with a graduate or postgraduate scholarship for study in any country.  Further google search engine verification reveals that the global body has a United Nations University which is the academic and research arm of the United Nations. Headquartered in Shibuya, Tokyo, Japan, with diplomatic status as a U.N. institution and a mission to help resolve global issues related to human development and welfare through collaborative research and education. Under its Scholarships and Funding page, it states clearly that Scholarship opportunities vary for each degree programme and the procedure for benefitting from it is that requests must be submitted with the programme application documents.  Forensic examination of images using cross-referencing, and examination of official channels reveals a lack of correlation between the claim and the UN or its affiliates. Based on this, it is concluded that the post is intended to trap unsuspecting students yearning to travel abroad and is therefore a SCAM.

Claim : Okra leaves can cause hyper ovulation and make one conceive twins or triplets .,"Inability to conceive has been an issue many women face. In some homes, women get pressured by society, mostly after marriage about getting pregnant. In some cases, falsehood mongers capitalise on this to spread unfounded information. Recently, a blog  post by Healthy living states that okra leaves can be used to boost one’s fertility and increase ability to conceive twins or even triplets.   The blog went further to note that soup made from okra leaves should be taken alongside snot apple (goron tula ) immediately after ovulation and throughout the ovulation period.  According to the post, the following are ways to boost fertility:  2 . Eat it daily, especially two weeks before ovulation and eat again a day before ovulation. 3. You will be highly fertile, it causes Hyper ovulation which will result in multiple Eggs. This claim prompted Dubawa to conduct a keyword word search to determine its validity. According to an article by Health GadgetsNG, a website that publishes health-related articles, conception happens when a sperm fertilizes an egg to form an embryo. However, if there are two eggs present in the womb at the time of fertilization a woman can become pregnant with twins.  Deccan Chronicle, a blog post, wrote that in Nigeria’s south west, the people of Igbo Ora believe that their conceptions of twins is associated with their consumption of okra leaves. The town became well known for its numerous conceptions of twins. Most families have at least a set of twins. The natives of Ora  revealed that consistent eating of a particular species of okra leaves known as Ilasa may make one conceive twins.  Dubawa also tried finding studies on Okra leaves and multiple pregnancies but did not find any. However, a Nutrition and Public Health Specialist, James Oloyede, said okra has nutritional value but the ‘twins’ claim is not scientifically proven.   “Well, okra is very rich in vitamin A and C, typical of many green leafy vegetables. On further analysis, it’s found to contain iron, some calcium and is very rich in fiber. “Unfortunately, it’s not too rich in zinc and vitamin E noted to boost fertility. “Therefore, the claims above are spurious and not backed up with any scientific proof yet. It’s one of food myths and cultural beliefs.” Similarly, Prof. Tanimola Akande, a Public Health Physician at University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital, said the fact that okra has useful chemicals does not mean it is capable of boosting fertility rate.  Tanimola said, “I am not aware of scientific studies that have been done to validate this claim. It is not enough to claim that it can improve fertility or twin pregnancy just because okra contains phytochemicals”. There is no scientific evidence that validates the claim that okra leaf boosts fertility and causes one to conceive twins or triplets.

"Claim: Two prominent digital media platforms recently reported that a federal lawmaker, Shina Peller, said Bola Tinubu should not be anointed as Nigeria’s next president in 2023.","Notable digital media platforms, including Sahara Reporters and Peoples Gazzette, recently reported that a member of the federal House of Representatives, Shina Peller, said Bola Tinubu should not be anointed as Nigeria’s next president. The media platforms also reported that the federal lawmaker representing Iseyin, Itesiwaju, Kajola and Iwajowa said political figures like the former Lagos State governor should not be allowed to take over the country’s helms of affairs in 2023. Coincidentally, the claim was attributed to Peller barely 24 hours after Tinubu, the national leader of the ruling party, the All Progressives Congress (APC), made a sensational return to the country. The former Lagos governor had been out of Nigeria on medical tourism in London. He returned on Friday night, October 8, and was given a rousing welcome by the incumbent Lagos State governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu. With the coincidence in Tinubu’s return and Peller’s alleged statement, the report drew massive reactions from Nigerians on social media.   Using the Crowdtangle web extension, a check on Sahara Reporters’ Twitter page of nearly four million followers showed that the story has 1,400 reactions (1,063 likes and 336 retweets.) A further search via Crowdtangle showed that many social media users shared the post on Facebook for their followers as contained here and here. Bola Tinubu, APC national leader and one of the founding fathers of the ruling party, has been rumoured to be eyeing the giant stool of power in the country in 2023 after the tenure of the current president Muhammadu Buhari. Although there is not yet an official declaration from his camp, the former governor, who enjoys an incredibly massive cult-hero respect from his teeming legion of followers and loyalists, has not publicly distanced himself from the campaigns linked to him. And in what has set the wheel of campaign on the move, his loyalists have begun his presidential campaign with his posters recently flooding London streets. On Tuesday, December 15, 2020, some of his followers led by former senator and minister Dayo Adeyeye, met in Ibadan, Oyo State capital, to launch a presidential campaign movement tagged “The South-West Agenda (SWAGA).” SWAGA is a movement backing the Tinubu 2023 agenda. A self-styled socialite and king of African nightclubs, Taoreed Shina Abiola Peller is an entrepreneur, politician, industrialist born into the family of late Moshood Abiola Peller, a renowned late magician. The 45-year-old, who traces his origins to Iseyin, a local government in Oyo State, rose to prominence in Lagos with his revolution of nightclubs in Africa–thanks to his Quilox club. In 2019, Peller contested on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) for the Iseyin, Itesiwaju, Kajola, Iwajowa seat in the House of Representatives. A people’s favourite, he defeated the then incumbent Olasupo Abiodun with 44,088 votes in a keenly contested election that officially introduced him to politics and government. Peller who describes himself as an “exceptional philanthropist who is selfless in many ways” is an advocate for youth participation in politics. He was recently given the chieftaincy title of Ayedero of Yorubaland by the Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamide Adeyemi. Verifying the claim, Dubawa found that truly Shina Peller spoke in a video interview with Sam Olatunji on his programme tagged “Uncut with BigSam,” where he spoke on the 2023 presidential election. However, there is no place he mentioned Tinubu or stated directly that the APC national leader should not be anointed Nigeria’s next president as claimed by Gazzette and Sahara Reporters. When asked about Bola Tinubu’s chance and Buhari’s successorship, Peller responded that leaders should be selected based on competence and upon fulfilling “criteria.”  The lawmaker emphasised that an “institution” should be built to see “who meets up with the criteria” for occupying power instead of taking a single person and “rallying around that person.” Swinging back the pendulum on Nigeria’s political history, the lawmaker stated that Nigeria has made “two mistakes” by presenting President Muhammadu Buhari and one of his predecessors Olusegun Obasanjo in a messianic robe to the people. He said: “We have made the mistake two times. There was a time in Nigeria when President Obasanjo was brought from prison and everybody was saying he is the best person that could do this and we started to run around him. The same thing happened to President Buhari, everybody was saying Mohammadu Buhari is a saint, he is not corrupt and then everyone starts to run around him, I believe this must stop. “We need to build an institution now, we do not need to take any single person and be saying we want to now rally around that person. I think let us form an institution, let us identify criteria and let us see who meets up with the criteria. “There is no institution that has set up the criteria yet, if the criteria say the next president should be Christian, is Asiwaju a Christian?” Dubawa’s findings revealed that the lawmaker also issued a rebuttal to the reports in the Gazette and SR, describing it as a “misrepresentation.” A check on his Facebook and Instagram page showed that on Sunday, October 10, the lawmaker stated that contrary to what was reported, he only “commented on the age-long political style of forcing candidates down the throat of the citizens, without thinking of the principles of equity, equality and fairness.” Here is the full statement: “My attention has been drawn to the news on blogs quoting me to have said that the APC Leader “Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu should not be anointed as next President”.  Sadly, it is a misrepresentation of what I said. To set the record straight, I have nothing against our leader nor his presidential ambition. I have enjoyed a father and son relationship with him for years, and it remains so. “I commented on the age-long political style of forcing candidates down the throat of the citizens, without thinking of the principles of equity, equality and fairness.  I stated that the rest of the world is leaving Nigeria behind in terms of rapid growth and development and only through strong institutions, we can collectively make just decisions for visible progress in the country, especially in our electioneering process.  “The next general election is a reset period for our dear country. We must get it right! Our collective decision must be based on promoting peace and unity.   Also, I urge the media practitioners, who are regarded as the fourth estate of the realm, to use their powerful instruments to promote love, peace and unity rather than stir up disunity, disaffection and unnecessary conflicts.” When contacted, one of the media aides to the Iseyin-born lawmaker, Hammed Olabisi, said his principal did not attack Tinubu as mischievously reported in the news. “What he said was that we should rely on God Almighty to choose the best for us and that we should not anoint as we have always done in the past. Citing examples of Yar’adua and current president Muhammad Buhari. He added that we should allow due process to take its cause instead of making the entire things to look like we have no procedures guiding us in selecting our leaders.” Olabisi also emphasised that what Peller said was that “building a strong institution will go a long way in picking a better candidate.” Examining the news report showed that Sahara Reporters and Peoples Gazzette’s headlines were misleading and mischievously sensationalised. Shina Peller was misrepresented and quoted out of context.

Claim: Boko Haram imposes Sharia in Niger state.,"In Nigeria, Sharia has been instituted as a main body of civil and criminal law in twelve Muslim-majority states since 1999, when then-Zamfara State governor, Ahmad Sani Yerima, began the push for the institution of Sharia at the state level of government.  A “declaration of full Sharia law” was made in the twelve states in that year, and the states created Islamic legal institutions such as a Sharia Commission, and Zakat Commission, and a Hisbah, (a group expected to promote Islamic virtue, whilst discouraging vice). A Twitter user with over 269,000 followers, Adetutu Balogun, with the handle @Tutsy22 in a tweet on Thursday October 7, 2021, claimed that Boko haram had imposed Sharia law in some communities in Shiroro local government area of  Niger state, North Central Nigeria and have informed Muslims and Christians that twelve year old girls are to be married off.  The communities according to the tweet are; Kawure, Kuregbe, Awulo and Chukuba. The tweet garnered over 500 likes and 422 retweets with numerous comments blaming Nigeria’s President Muhammadu Buhari and the Nigerian government, within an hour it was posted. A twitter user, Darlykingo with the handle @Darlykingo3 says “Buhari says it is their right to do so”……. Another user, Mr Wick with the handle @Valarmuurghulis says “Niger State is less than 100km from Aso villa they are getting there”…. other twitter were wondering if the military is not aware of their hideout to flush them out. DUBAWA begins its verification by carrying out a simple Google search to find out states in Nigeria where Sharia law is practised. The search returned a post on Pulse.ng, which mentioned four things to know about sharia in Nigeria; it also listed the states where sharia is practiced in the country as follows; Zamfara, Kano, Sokoto, Katsina, Bauchi, Borno, Jigawa, Kebbi, Yobe, Kaduna, Niger and Gombe states. Further search revealed that Sharia Law was introduced in Niger State in May, 2000 during the administration of late Governor Abdullahi Kure. Narrowing the search to recent events in the state about the activities of the Boko Haram news story published by Vanguard newspapers that the state Governor Abubakar Bello in April 2021, lamented that Boko Haram had already infiltrated the state and had not only hoisted their flags in captured villages, including Kaure village in the Shiroro Local Government of the state, they had also forcefully allocated displaced women to themselves as wives. Speaking when he visited the Internally Displaced People, IDPs Camp at the IBB primary school near the Emir of Minna’s palace, Governor Bello said because of the influx of the displaced people from the villages, the IBB Primary School was hurriedly turned into IDP camp by government to cater for the affected people. According to the governor “Sambisa is several kilometers from Abuja, but Kaure is just two kilometers from Abuja, insisting that nobody is safe anymore, not even residents of Abuja. “Flag hoisted by the terrorist group is now visible in Kaure village in the Shiroro LGA”, he said. Further search also revealed a claim by the chairman of Shiroro local government area of the state, Suleiman Chukuba, while speaking to newsmen on October 1, 2021, sais that 500 communities in eight wards of the Local Government Area are under the control of Boko Haram. The claim was widely reported by Channels TV, The Nation, The Cable,  YouTube among others. He listed the affected areas as Manta, Gurmana, Bassa-Kokki, Allawa, Kurebe, Kushaka, Kwati, Chukuba and Galadima Kogo. According to him, the insurgents have attempted to incorporate and recruit residents of the communities to become Boko Haram members. Mr Chukuba, who lamented the situation, also said the terrorists are trying to equip the people to fight against the government. “They incorporate the people of those communities by telling them they have arms and money to give them so they can assist them in fighting the government,” he added. Although the terrorists have found their way to some communities, neither the residents nor the group claimed Boko Haram had imposed Sharia Law or that 12-year-olds should be married off. Given the evidence available, the claim that Boko Haram had imposed Sharia law in some communities in Shiroro local government area of Niger state and have informed Muslims and Christians that 12-year-old girls are to be married off is misleading.

"Claim: a mobile based message making the rounds claims that  FG has begun  cash transfer to 200,000 Nigerians.","Claim: a mobile based message making the rounds claims that  FG has begun  cash transfer to 200,000 Nigerians.  This claim is false. The text message is not from FG or MTN but directly related to Mblog, a mobile based chat platform. In August this year, the Federal Government announced its intentions  to commence cash payments to 200,000 Nigerians. The initiative targeted urban poor senior citizens that do not have access to regular income and are impacted by COVID-19. However, not more than 2 months after this initiative, a text message making rounds on people’s mobile phones claims that the federal government will yet again transfer cash to 200,000 Nigerians. The message reads:  “KINS# FG begins cash transfer to 200,000 Nigerians, from Lagos and Imo and to other 36 States poor Nigeria. if u have not received, Reply W to 50017 to ask how.” While it is no news that the government has been engaged in similar acts of service, fraudsters have also capitalized on this means to capitalize on people’s vulnerability.  First, Dubawa ran an analysis on sources of  the text message and  findings show that ‘W’  ‘50017’  is the message contact for joining a certain mobile-based text messaging platform called “Mblog”. The Mblog is developed by SICS in collaboration with Ericsson and serves only MTN users.  By sending ‘W’ to 50017, users are automatically signed up for this chat platform and are thereafter given further instructions to choose a username.  While users will further receive messages for the cash prize, subsequent messages that will follow after continuing will require them to invite friends to the chat platform to get a free trial.  When DUBAWA spoke with an MTN representative, Ms Elizabeth, she acknowledged the existence of the Mblog but admitted she is unaware of such dealings and would advise the public to stay off it.  “MTN users can join Mblog but about the cash transfers and texting ‘W’ to 50017 for a cash transfer I am unaware of and will advise the public to stay off it.” Elizabeth said.  She added that “if MTN was involved in such a process, a clearer and more detailed message would have been communicated.” Even at that, the subsequent messages that followed clearly indicated the Mblog and offered users an alternative way to subscribe.  While the federal government may have given cash to some persons in the past, the message making the rounds currently is false and has nothing to do with the Federal Government.

Claim: A message circulating on WhatsApp claims that warm water is effective in curing Asthma and  17 other health conditions.,"Claim: A message circulating on WhatsApp claims that warm water is effective in curing Asthma and  17 other health conditions.  Although drinking more water may bring some health benefits, like digestion and improved kidney health, there is no scientific evidence that Japanese water therapy can cure diabetes or cancer.  A viral message shared multiple times on WhatsApp claims that a  group of Japanese doctors have confirmed that drinking warm water will effectively cure Asthma and 17 other illnesses. While persuading readers to share the message with loved ones so that it can save lives, the message also prescribes a warm water therapy which entails drinking approximately 4 glasses of warm water on empty stomach as an effective remedy to health issues such as cancer, blood pressure, diabetes, uterus health, heart diseases, epilepsy and paralysis. The message reads partly: “WARM WATER PLEASE SHARE THIS WITH FAMILY AND FRIENDS, IT’S VERY IMPORTANT AND CAN SAVE SOMEONE’S LIFE. A group of Japanese Doctors confirmed that warm water is 100% effective in resolving some health problems  DO NOT eat anything 45mins after taking the water. The warm water therapy will resolve the health problems within reasonable period such as:- Diabetes in 30 days, Blood pressure in 30 days, Stomach problems in 10 days, All types of Cancer in 9 months, Blockage of veins in 6 months, Poor appetite in 10 days, Uterus and related diseases in 10 days, Nose, Ear, and Throat problems in 10 days, Women problems in 15 days, Heart diseases in 30 days, Headache/migraine in 3 days, Cholesterol in 4 months, Epilepsy and paralysis continuously in 9 months, Asthma in 4 months. COLD WATER IS BAD FOR YOU!!! If cold water does not affect you at young age, it will harm you at old age. * Cold water closes 4 veins of the heart and causes heart attack. Cold drinks are main reason for heart attack. * It also creates problems in the liver. It makes fat stuck with liver. Most people waiting for liver transplant are victims of cold water drinking. * Cold water affect internal walls of the stomach. It affects the large intestine and results in Cancer. PLEASE DON’T KEEP THIS INFORMATION TO YOURSELF Tell someone to tell someone, *IT MAY SAVE SOMEONE’S LIFE. “KNOWLEDGE IS POWER”  Help someone today by sharing it with your loved ones and friends, may God help us all….. Aameen” The ambiguous use of “a  group of Japanese doctors’  and  the continuous persuasion in the message got this researcher wondering how true the claim can be since several claims as this one have been verified to be fake and misleading. So, Dubawa decided to check the authenticity of the claim. A key word search revealed that this claim has been making the rounds since 2017 and it has been shared widely on social media and blogs. The message was shared on  Pinterest, an American image sharing and social media service, and also  on quora, a social question-and-answer website, and the healthy lifestyle page on facebook  in 2017. Daily Times, a Nigerian based newspaper also published a report that included the claim, on 23 September 2017 attributing  the source of the report to a “message trending on Whatsapp.” According to Healthline, drinking warm water can: Supposedly, Japanese water therapy gets its name from being widely used in Japanese medicine and among the Japanese people, according to healthline It involves drinking room-temperature or warm water on an empty stomach after waking to cleanse the digestive system and regulate gut health, which according to proponents can heal a variety of conditions. Advocates of Japanese water therapy claim that cold water is harmful to human health because it can harden the fats and oils in the digestive tract, thus slowing down digestion and causing disease. The therapy includes the following steps that should be repeated daily: According to practitioners, Japanese water therapy must be done for different periods to treat different conditions. examples: The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine recommends that men 19 and older consume 3.7 liters of water per day (15.5 cups) and women 19 and older consume 2.7 liters per day (11.5 cups).  Dr Daniel Meshak, a lecturer, Department of Family Medicine, University of Jos and Consultant Family Physician, JUTH, Jos,  in an interview with this researcher, said it is a false claim, noting that there is no scientific basis to explain the claim. Meshak said “ warm water may have health benefits, but it has not been proven scientifically.”  He added that water generally aids in hydration, digestion, and kidney cleansing, “ This Japanese water therapy has not been scientifically proven which makes it complementary and alternative medicine. Sometimes this  complementary and alternative medicine as integrated with the othodox medicine if proven. But drinking a good quantity of water helps with hydration because dehydration causes headache, faecal impaction, intestinal obstruction and acute kidney injury” He added. Though drinking more water may bring some health benefits like constipation and improve kidney health, there is no scientific evidence that Japanese water therapy can cure diabetes or cancer.

"Claim: Many newspapers and blogs recently reported that Ekiti State Governor, Dr Kayode Fayemi, called on the Federal Government to recruit NYSC corps members to fight Boko Haram and bandits in Nigeria.","Recently, a statement credited to the Ekiti State Governor, Dr Kayode Fayemi, quoted him as saying that the Federal Government should deploy NYSC corps members in the fight against Boko Haram. This story has gone viral, and has been circulated widely both in newspapers and on social media. Frontline media organisations like Punch, Sahara Reporters, and Daily Posts among others had quoted the Ekiti State Governor as saying,  “I believe one of the cheapest and fastest ways to handle this is to amend the law setting up the National Youth Service Corps such that we can use the existing orientation camps to train willing and able graduates to reflate the security personnel under a special arrangement that will be worked out. “That way, the fund that is currently deployed to the NYSC can be used with just some additional funding which could be sourced through a national emergency fund for the next five to 10 years. Those who cannot join the military services can serve in their community without pay if we must still retain the NYSC for everyone.” On Wednesday, 13 October, a certain Campus News blog, in its headline, quoted the Governor thus: ‘USE CORPS MEMBERS TO FIGHT BOKO HARAM, OTHERS WHO CAN’T FIGHT SHOULD WORK WITHOUT PAY, FAYEMI TELLS FG’ Fayemi was alleged to have made the statement in the lecture he delivered at the Babatunde Oduyoye Annual Birthday Lecture in Ibadan on Tuesday, 12 October 2021. A check on the media reveals that Governor Fayemi was actually at the event in Ibadan where he delivered the seventh lecture series to mark the 2021 annual birthday ceremony of Chief Babatunde Oduyoye, the Special Adviser to Governor Seyi Makinde on Political Affairs. Did Fayemi say that corps members should be recruited to fight Boko Haram? Many media houses reported in their headlines that he actually called for the recruitment of corps members to fight insecurity. However, The Cable, reporting the same event, quoted Governor Fayemi as saying, ‘a cost-effective and quick way to achieve the recruitment drive is to reform the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) and encourage “willing” corps members to join military services. With this, we can use the existing orientation camps to train willing and able graduates to reflate the security personnel under a special arrangement that will be worked out.’ An examination of this statement seems to suggest that the governor actually asked that volunteers and willing corps members can be recruited to help in combating insecurity in the country, as is reflected in a WhatsApp graphic supposedly from the Ekiti State Government, in an attempt to clarify the alleged misrepresentation of the governor by some sections of the media. A text message was sent to Mr Olayinka Oyebode, the Chief Press Secretary to Governor Kayode Fayemi, for clarification on the matter. He replied that the Governor only indicated that ‘the young graduates have an option to embrace the military or opt to continue in their line of profession after the training,’ meaning that he was quoted out of context.  An examination of the body of most of the news media that reported the statements of Governor Fayemi shows that the headlines were misleading, and for most part, misrepresented the statement of the Governor. Most of the stories quoted the Governor out of context. The claim is therefore misleading.

Claim: A viral WhatsApp post claims that ageing starts from the feet upward.,"Recently, A viral message on WhatsApp claimed that ageing starts from the feet upwards. The post further stated that “As a   person gets older, the accuracy & speed of transmission of instructions   between the brain and   the legs decreases, unlike when a person is young. *Please walk*” It added that “The   so-called   Bone Fertilizer Calcium will  sooner  or later  be  lost  with  the passage  of  time,  making  the   elderly  more  prone  to   bone fractures.” Further search also revealed that the post is viral on Facebook with various posts by Seth Smith and Reach-Together Mudras and Colour Therapy, which has garnered many likes and shares.  Ageing especially in humans represents the accumulation of changes over time and this can manifest through physical, psychological, and social changes. According to the World Health Organization WHO, at the biological level, ageing results from the effect of the buildup of a wide variety of molecular and cellular damage over time. This then leads to a gradual decline in physical and mental capacity, a growing risk of disease, and eventually death. These changes are neither linear nor consistent, and they are only loosely associated with a person’s age in years. The diversity seen in the older population is not random. Beyond biological changes, ageing is often associated with other life transitions such as retirement, relocation to more appropriate housing, and the death of friends and partners. No single process can explain all the effects of ageing. This is because ageing is a complex process that varies in how it affects different people. Physiologists have found out that as one grows older, changes occur in the following parts of the body: –         Hormone Production –         Immunity –         The Skin –         Sleep –         Bones, muscles, and joint –         The Breast –         The Face –         The Female and Male Reproductive system –         The Heart and blood vessels. –         The Kidneys –         The Lungs –         The Nervous system. According to psychologists, people really do vary in how they age and this starts in young adulthood. So, does ageing really start from the feet upwards? The human foot is a highly developed complex structure that serves to bear the weight of the body. It contains a lot of moving parts which encompasses 26 bones, 33 joints, and over 100 ligaments. Such intricacy is essential because the foot is required to do many different activities such as running, walking, and climbing. According to a study published in the Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation Journal, age-related changes in the feet include modifications in the skin, which becomes dry, inelastic, and cool, often exhibiting hyperkeratosis. This is just as the contour of the foot broadens with age and may have bigger forefoot elevation in the presence of toe deformities. Sensory acuity also diminishes, as does joint flexibility, muscle-force production, and the ability to withstand stress. But does ageing start from the feet? A Geriatric doctor, Dr. Ezekiel Medunoye, said there’s no scientific evidence that proves ageing starts from the feet upwards. According to him, ‘generally, the cells of the body lose a little of their vitality as one ages. So, there’s no part of the body that gets old first, as the cells work together. I think the cells of the body generally start to experience some problems in their ability to handle vital functions of the body.’ A family physician, Ademola Ayodele, said different body parts age differently but the feet are definitely not the first to age for now until proven otherwise scientifically. He added, “when the bone stops growing, that’s evidence that the person has reached a landmark in age. And if that’s what they mean; when they say aging starts from the feet up as regards when the bone stops, then I can accept that. However, every part of the body works together, just as different body parts work independently but for a common goal.” “We cannot definitely pinpoint where aging starts from as it is an all-encompassing process, and as such different body parts age differently but the feet are definitely for now not the first to age until proven otherwise.” he said. A recent study reveals that humans age at different rates as well as potentially through different biological mechanisms. Though the whole body ages in some individuals, some systems age faster or slower than others. And as such, there is quite a bit of difference in how individuals age on a molecular level. Another study shows that as one ages, the feet need a lot of help to age gracefully as many changes take place. The foot’s ligaments, fascia, and skin start to atrophy but the study did not specify that aging starts from the feet. It, however, recommends that as one ages, strengthening area muscles can often enhance the functioning of the feet and this contributes to one’s overall balance, stability, and flexibility. There is no scientific evidence that ageing starts from the feet upwards as ageing affects different body parts to different degrees. However, taking good care of the feet is well advised.

"Claim: A message on WhatsApp claims that the messaging app is ending tomorrow at 6p.m., although the date of the ‘tomorrow’ in the announcement was not stated. The message claims that users must pay to reopen the app. The message has also been circulating in audio format.","A WhatsApp message claiming that the platform is ending ‘tomorrow by 6p.m.,’ has gone virile on various social media platforms. The message claims that WhatsApp servers have been congested and need the help of users to solve the problem of decongestion while urging active users to forward the message to all their contacts. A threat that if users fail to forward  the message, users will be charged, and the account will remain inactive with consequences of losing their contacts. The claim states that the message is also from Jim Balsamic, the CEO of WhatsApp. The voice warned that the message is the last warning from WhatsApp and should be forwarded as soon as possible to generate a green icon that will allow users to use WhatsApp and Facebook. The voice claims the message is from Varun Pulyani, the director of WhatsApp claiming the App has been sold to Mark Zuckerberg for 19 billion dollars. It says the message should be forwarded to twenty (20) contacts to change the icon to that of WhatsApp and Facebook within twenty-four hours. It then states again that a forward of the message to ten people will not allow users to be deactivated from the platform.  It further claims that the use of WhatsApp will cost money from summer 2017. The audio message claims forwarding the message to 20 people will also give users a free use of the app; otherwise, it will be paid for to be used.  Dubawa started by first analysing the content of the message and from the first sentence that states that “Tomorrow at 6pm they are ending whatsapp and you have to pay to open it, this is by law,”. Dubawa notes the vagueness of the sentence that provides time without the date of the day in question.   To use WhatsApp , you must have data which is already paid for as you go, so, users are paying to use WhatsApp. And on a 3rd note, ”This is by law” is also vague because it did not state which law. According to an IT expert in Ilorin, Engineer Ibrahim Mojeed, “If it is true that the WhatsApp server is congested, it does not need to forward messages to decongest its server.” A google search on Jim Balsamic page showed that he has also gone ahead to deny the message which he described as spam on the 19th of march 2020.  This indicates that it is really a scam message resurfacing every year. WhatsApp on its website WhatsApp Web confirmed on its blog that a similar message was also spammed in January 2021.This spam has attracted various online media platforms over the years who have done various fact checks as the message resurfaces, beginning from16th January 2012 when it first emerged.  For example, chef.com.news in July 17, 2013 carried a report of a spam by WhatsApp CEO and it was a hoax message alert emanating from blackberry messaging service, BB. Dubawa discovered that since 2012 when the spam message first broke, that of October 2021 is the 7th time the claim is resurfacing with many Facebook and WhatsApp users falling for the spam. The same disclaimer from WhatsApp website was also recirculated to debunk the claim.  Findings show that the viral WhatsApp messages note claiming that WhatsApp is ending ‘tomorrow’ is a spam. A visit to WhatsApp website and Jim Balsamic’s page revealed the claim is a hoax that has been recirculating since 2012.

The message has been shared many times with the indication that Nigerians can also apply for the American Visa Lottery and can legally migrate to the United States of America. Nigerian citizens are not eligible for the American Visa Lottery at the moment; therefore, the message is inapplicable to Nigerians. Therefore, the claim is misleading. The viral WhatsApp message, which has been shared many times across many groups over the last one week, claims that the American Visa Lottery Application Form 2021/2022 is now open, and that people can now go online to register for the lottery, with a prompt to go to the website https://visaslottery.com/Apply_Now  to check their eligibility and register. This researcher visited the website, https://visaslottery.com/Apply_Now to ascertain its genuineness. The website is inaccessible, and potentially insecure, as all attempts to explore it were unsuccessful. A check on the website of the United States Embassy and Consulate in Nigeria indicates that ‘Nigerians are no longer eligible for the Diversity Visa Lottery.’ It warned Nigerians to beware of fraudulent websites and scam emails that are lurking around to mislead people, warning: ‘Beware of fraud and scams. Some websites and emails attempt to mislead customers, posing as providers of official U.S. government information. Read our Fraud Warning here.’ The Cable reported in 2020 that Nigeria is the only African country currently excluded from participating in the 2022 US diversity visa (DV) lottery and that the exclusion of Nigeria  dates back to 2015. Before 2015, according to documents seen by TheCable, more than three million entries were received from Nigerians for the DV lottery in 2013 and 2014. Within the same two-year period preceding 2015, among African countries, Nigerians were issued the second highest number of slots in the DV lottery — after Egypt; Nigerians received 5,741 visas for both years, while Egypt natives got 6,883 within the same period. The Immigration Act of 1990 established the Diversity Visa (DV) program, where 55,000 immigrant visas would be available in an annual lottery, starting in fiscal year 1995. The lottery aims to diversify the immigrant population in the United States, by selecting applicants mostly from countries with low rates of immigration to the United States in the previous five years. This researcher sent an email to an official of the U.S. State Department, Temitayo Famutimi. In a reply to the mail, Famutimi stated that the website in circulation on social media in Nigeria regarding the Visa lottery is not genuine: “The circulating image/website is not genuine. Complete information on the program can be found at Diversity Visa Instructions. “Only citizens from countries with historically low rates of immigration to the United States are eligible to apply for the diversity visa program. Currently, Nigerian citizens are not eligible. “Our websites ––United States Embassy, U.S. Department of State, U.S. Visa Information Service –– and other U.S. government sites are the only reliable sources of information for our programs and announcements.”    The United States State Department has debunked the claim contained in the viral message, stating also that the website attached to the message is not genuine.

Claim: WhatsApp message claims FG has began payment of stipends to University and Colleges of education students,"A viral message on WhatsApp messaging app states that the Federal government has approved and began the payment of the federal government bursary to students who are currently studying in any accredited college of education in the country. The message claims that the Bursary Board will pay N75,000, N50, 000, N40,000, N20 , 000 per semester or term to students in universities, polytechnics, colleges and secondary schools respectively. The message also directed interested applicants to visit the online registration portal, adding that payment for October has begun for all applicants. It attached a website for students to check eligibility and for applications. On Tuesday 5 October 2021, the Federal Government proposed to pay the sum of N75,000 per semester for undergraduates studying education courses in public institutions and N50,000 for those who enroll for a National Certificate in Education (N.C.E.) programme. The Minister of Education, Adamu Adamu, made the announcement during the celebration of this year’s World Teachers’ Day in Abuja as the Federal Government reintroduces bursary awards. The Minister also noted that it will liaise with the Ministries of Education in the 36 states including the FCT Education Board, to identify respective courses of study required by each state after which N150,000 will be awarded for undergraduates and N100,000 for NCE students. Adamu said the fund would be sourced from UBEC, TETFund, and managed by the Federal Scholarship Board. Beneficiaries will also be awarded a sponsorship to at least one refresher training per annum. The news was widely reported in the news media like Legit.ng, Punch, Channels TV, Tribune, Vanguard amongst others. Dubawa began its verification by clicking the link attached to the message and the search leads to a website with the logo of the Federal Scholarship Board and a form to fill. The form has a request for name, phone number, name of institution and a continue button. The next page contains further questions on the type of institution attended by the student, geo political zone of the students, and the age range of the student. The page also contains some Facebook comments of purported beneficiaries writing good reviews about the grant scheme. Afterwards, a page was shown informing that the applicants had been approved for the grants. “After checking your applications, You have been approved N75,000 GRANTS PER SEMESTER Do Not Share Your Personal Withdrawal Code FG24/21/3034,” it says. It added that the BURSARY FUNDS will be available immediately after the applicant clicks the “Invite Friends/Group” button and shares the information with 15 friends or 5 groups on WhatsApp so “That They Can Also Be Aware of the BURSARY PROGRAMME.” It asked for the account details of the student at the end of the page. Further findings show that the website is not related to the MDA responsible for tertiary education in the country as it does not have its URL extension ending with gov.ng like all MDAs of the Nigerian government.  The original website of the FG scholarship board is https://education.gov.ng/fsb/  as its original website address. We further analysed the website using Whois,  a query and response tool used for searching databases that store registered users and assignees of an internet resource such as domain name, IP address block and a wide range of other information. Whois.domaintools.com showed that the website’s main domain was claimoffer.net registered August 25, 2018. The current IP location is New York, USA. The IP history shows that the IP address has been changed once. Further findings also revealed the report of the story by Premium Times saying that the registrar and chief executive officer of the Teachers’ Registration Council of Nigeria (TRCN), Josiah Ajiboye, a professor, said the implementation of the payment will commence in 2022. Based on verification, it is evident that the viral message is a scam and a ploy to defraud unsuspecting students of tertiary institutions in Nigeria.

The audio is making the rounds a few days after Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger suffered outages that made their services inaccessible  for about six hours.

We require our active users to forward this message to each of the people in your contact list to confirm our active users using WhatsApp, if you do not send this message to all your contacts WhatsApp will then start to charge you. Your account will remain inactive with the consequence of losing all your contacts.” It further said: “Message from Jim Balsamic (CEO of Whatsapp ) we have had an over usage of user names on whatsapp Messenger. We are requesting all users to forward this message to their entire contact list. If you do not forward this message, we will take it as your account is invalid and it will be deleted within the next 48 hours. Please DO NOT ignore this message or whatsapp will no longer recognise your activation. If you wish to re-activate your account after it has been deleted, a charge of 25.00 will be added to your monthly bill. We are also aware of the issue involving the pictures updates not showing.” Dubawa started by conducting a keyword search and found that the information is not new and has been circulated several times as a WhatsApp message but not as a voice note. Further checks also revealed that Facebook acquired WhatsApp in 2014 from Jan Koum and Brian Acton who are the founders of WhatsApp, not by Varun Pulyani or Jim Balsamic. Also, there has been no changes in the WhatsApp logo since it joined Facebook in 2014. In January 2012, WhatsApp addressed the claim: “Message from Jim Balsamic (CEO of Whatsapp) we have had an over usage of user names on whatsapp Messenger. We are requesting all users to forward this message to their entire contact list. If you do not forward this message, we will take it as your account is invalid and it will be deleted within the next 48 hours.

If you wish to re-activate your account after it has been deleted, a charge of 25.00 will be added to your monthly bill. We are also aware of the issue involving the pictures updates not showing. We are working diligently at fixing this problem and it will be up and running as soon as possible. Thank you for your cooperation from the Whatsapp team.” The company added : “It is a hoax. Really, it is. Please understand that this is a hoax and there is no truth to it.” The viral WhatsApp voice note claim is a hoax. The content is not new and  has been circulated as a message before. Also, WhatsApp only disburses information through its official blog or social media handles. ",FALSE,13/10/2021,https://dubawa.org/viral-voice-note-on-whatsapp-billing-false/
Claim: A Twitter user claimed that the pictorial book unveiled by President Muhammadu Buhari has been certified by the Guinness World Records as the world’s largest photo book.,"A Twitter user, Eniola, with a handle @eniolaofLagos” in a tweet on Friday, October 1, had claimed that Nigerian president, Muhammadu Buhari, unveiled the largest pictorial book in the world. Sharing multiple pictures from the event, the tweep, who has over forty thousand followers on the micro-blogging website, also claimed that the book has been “certified by the Guinness Book of World Records at 60sqm.” Check by Dubawa as of Sunday, October 4, showed that the tweet only garnered one like and retweet.  The same tweet was shared by a popular Twitter handle with 1.6 million followers @Gidi_Traffic, and it has 4 retweets, 22 likes, and 22 quotes. However, there seems to be skepticism over the “largest photo book and Guinness World Record” claims.  For instance, The Cable, a popular online newspaper, reported the news with “world’s largest photobook” put in apostrophes.  While this signposted a modicum of uncertainty, it also triggered a further finding which showed that some Nigerians do not actually believe in the “biggest pictorial book” claim. Using Crowdtangle web extension to locate comments about the book, A Facebook user Okonnah Godfrey Amaechi, while commenting under a post by Channels TV, was unconvinced about the photobook being the “largest.” And he commented: In the same vein, a Twitter user, Hammed Olajide Yaqub (HammedYaqub), also expressed doubt over the “largest photo-book” claim. In a tweet, he wrote: “Last week, President Buhari unveiled a giant photo book by his official photographer, Bayo Omoboriowo. The question is: is the book the biggest pictorial book in the world as claimed by the presidency? I doubt it. Besides, they claimed the book has been recognised by GUINNESS. This may be untrue.” The tweep, however, celebrated the book as  “a big contribution to the existing repertoire of Nigeria’s history.  I celebrate Omoboriowo’s ingenuity.” On Thursday, September 30, President Muhammadu Buhari unveiled a giant photo book titled “Discover Nigeria” in a colourful event graced by top personalities in the country including the vice president Yemi Osinnajo, Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, and Senate president, Dr. Ahmed Lawan. Captured in dazzling images and fecund history in celebration of Nigeria, the book, which was written by the official photographer of President Buhari, Bayo Omoboriowo was unveiled at the State House Banquet Centre, Abuja.  In a post on his verified Facebook page, Buhari Sallau, a presidential aide, claimed that the book has been “certified By Guinness Book of World Records at 60 Sqm.”  Speaking on the book in a post on his official Facebook page on Wednesday, September 29, Femi Adesina, a media and publicity aide to President Buhari, claimed that the “392-page book, authored by Bayo Omoboriowo, the President’s official photographer, showcases the country’s rich traditional institutions, ingenuity of its people, the beauty of its landscape, the richness of its farmlands, stunning waterfalls and seas, among others.” Adesina also claimed that the previous record for the largest photo book is 45square meters. According to him, the ‘‘Discover Nigeria’’ book has been printed and mounted as a 60sqm giant frame book-60 images, 60 pages, 60 square meters, celebrating Nigeria at 60 (60:60:60:60).’’  The author, Omoboriowo, while giving his over 160k Instagram followers a peep into the idea that birthed the book, said Discover Nigeria was “to create a positive narrative about our country.” In a post on Sunday, October 3, on his official and verified Instagram handle, @bayoomoboriowo, the Ekiti-born photographer thanked his principal for his support and submitted that Nigeria is “a beautiful country with huge potentials.” “I’m glad our efforts in promoting Nigerian Art and Culture to the world haven’t been a wasted effort. Join us to Discover Nigeria, join us to create a new narrative of a vibrant people and culture,” Omoboriowo said. A photobook, according to TATE, is a book of photographs written by a photographer that has an overarching theme or follows a storyline. The organisation which aims at increasing “the public’s enjoyment and understanding of British art from the 16th century to the present day” further explained that a photo book is “a convenient and reasonably cheap way of disseminating the work of a photographer to a mass audience.” It chronicles history or a particular idea extended via photographs in order to educate and enlighten the public through mass publication. The first photobook was reported to be “Photographs of British Algae: Cyanotype Impressions” which was created by Anna Atkins between 1843–1853. Claim: is Omoboriowo’s “Discover Nigeria” world’s largest photo book  and certified by the Guinness World Records? Measured and mounted as a 60sqm giant frame book-60 images, 60 pages, 60 square meters, Bayo Omoboriowo’s book “Discover Nigeria” is truly the largest photobook in the world. This is based on the 392-page book’s recognition by the Guinness World Records, a reference book and website published annually, listing world records both of human achievements and the extremes of the natural world. In a statement published on its official website, the organisation, also known by its current name “Guinness Book of Records”, certified that the photobook is the “largest photo book” measuring at 60.84 m². The recognition took effect on Thursday, September 30, when “Discover Nigeria” was unveiled by the president in Abuja. “The largest photo book measures 60.84 m² (654 ft² 87 in²) achieved by TheJTAgency, Bayo Omoboriowo and Federal Republic of Nigeria, (all Nigeria) in Abuja, Nigeria, verified on 30 September 2021. The book is a recreation of the photo book titled Discover Nigeria,” the official statement read. Although Omoboriowo’s book again re-introduced Nigeria to the upper echelons of society, this is not the first time Nigeria and Nigerians are featured in the Guinness World Records for incredible feats. In February 2021, Nigerian athlete, Blessing Okagbare, made an entry into the Guinness World Records as the only athlete to have attended the Athletics Diamond Meetings 67 times.  She broke the news for her over 31,000 followers on the photo and video-sharing app, Instagram. In 2020, Eche Chinonso, a then 12-year-old football freestyle prodigy from Delta State, better known as “amazing Kid Eche,” set the record for “most consecutive football (soccer) touches in one minute while balancing a football on the head.” The feat, achieved on November 14, 2019, with an impressive 111 touches, was recognised by the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) and the Guinness World Records book.   Similarly, in 2006, Nigeria’s dance and showbiz queen, Kafayat Oluwatoyin Shafau, broke the Guinness World Record for Longest Dance Party at the Nokia Silverbird Danceathon when she danced for 52 hours and 3 minutes nonstop. In an interview with The Punch newspaper in 2017, Kaffy, her stage name, revealed that she “almost died” in order to achieve the feat. Olawumi Treasure Bayode, another Nigerian, set a new Guinness Record in the “Longest Marathon Reading Aloud” category in 2018. The father of three logged 120 hours at 15.30 today at the YouRead Library Yaba in Lagos. He surpassed the previous record set by Nepali Deepak Sharma Bajagain. Stephen Keshi, a former and late Nigeria’s Super Eagles coach, Adetunwase Adenle, and Haruna Abdulazeez respectively have also been recognised by the Guinness Records. Many Nigerians have put the country on the world map through their endless pursuit of greatness and history, and Bayo Omoboriowo is not an exception. With his photo book “Discover Nigeria” the official photographer to President Muhammadu Buhari again reintroduced Nigeria into the Guinness World Records, a commendable act that also celebrated Nigeria’s multi-cultural uniqueness and endearing flora and fauna.

"Claim : Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger to shut down again for 7 days – Mark Zuckerberg","When Facebook’s server shut down worldwide for about six hours on Monday October 4, 2021, many businesses suffered along with it.  The platform which also operates Instagram and WhatsApp has been playing key roles in commerce in recent times, with many Small and Medium Enterprises companies all over the world relying on Facebook’s network instead of their own websites. Facebook in an update later said the network that came crashing down wasn’t a hack, but rather a self-inflicted problem. An update to Facebook’s routers that coordinate network traffic went wrong, which sent a wave of disruptions rippling through its systems and as a result, all things connected to Facebook were effectively shut down, worldwide. According to Facebook, “Configuration changes on the backbone routers that coordinate network traffic between our data centers, blocking their ability to communicate and setting off a cascade of network failures.” The problem was made worse because the outage also disrupted Facebook’s own internal systems and tools that it relies on for daily operations, thus making its solution more elusive, as workers were reportedly faced with difficulty in reaching the space where the routers are located. After the social media pages were back online, different messages started flying around among which is the claim that the founder and CEO of Facebook Mark Zuckerberg has posted on his page that Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger to shut down again for 7 days beginning from October 6, 2021by 13:00 hrs. Dubawa  began its verification by using who posted what application used to conduct a search of posts on Facebook by its CEO in the last 24 hours. The search returned a post of Mark sharing a post which he said he wrote to everyone working at Facebook. Further search on Mark’s Facebook page revealed that his last post before that was on October 5, 2021 congratulating the scientists at the Biohub on all their breakthroughs starting five years ago. The next post to it was the post on October 4, the day the company’s server went down. According to him “Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger are coming back online now. Sorry for the disruption today — I know how much you rely on our services to stay connected with the people you care about,”his post reads. Given the evidence available and resources on the internet, it was evident that the purported Facebook page of Mark Zuckerberg was cloned and he did not post the said message, even at 22:00 hrs on October 6, 2021 Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram were still working, which made the claim to be untrue.

"Claim: A claim, alleged to have emanated from the National Orientation Agency, states that taking shelter under metallic structures and holding metallic objects during rainstorms is a risk to lives and property.","A WhatsApp user sent out a claim that touching or holding metal during violent rainstorms and lightning flashes is a risk to lives and properties, adding that people should guard against it. The public notification, allegedly from NOA, states that in order to avoid taking risks to life and property, the general public should avoid taking shelter under metallic structures and not hold metallic objects. It further gave five other safety tips to avoid during rainstorms and lightning to include the following: This claim has gone viral on social media. Dubawa began verification by contacting the National  Orientation Agency’s headquarters in Abuja where the Assistant Director of Press, Paul Odenyi, refuted the claim in a telephone conversation.  “This is not the first time this is circulating around social media. It has been circulating every rainy season for the past five years,” he said. Mr Odenyi called the attention of this writer to a press release urging the general public to disregard what he described as  “recurrent viral fake news.”  The release implores Nigerians to seek correct information regarding the protection of lives and property during the rainy season from the Nigerian Meteorological Agency, NIMET, and to always verify NOA’s Press statements from its official handles. Dubawa went further to research on whether the claims could protect people’s lives and property by speaking to a professor of physics from the University of Ilorin, Abiodun Adimula. Professor Adimula told Dubawa that there is no conclusive evidence that you can’t use your phone while it is raining but there is no doubt that the energy that radiates from lightning can cause, especially when unprotected while using earthings or surge protection. Giving a breakdown of the claim, Professor Adimula explained that the rain vibrates electromagnetic energy which can cause harm to a phone carrier.  “It is advisable to switch off electronics during the rain because you cannot predict lightning which can interfere with signals into your electronics or even be transmitted through your wall sockets,” he added.  He, however, objected to the view about the transformer, adding that the transformer has an in-built protective device. Another scientist at the University of Ilorin, Professor Joshua Obaleye, explained that mirrors and glass objects can reflect lightning into the eyes and this can cause damage to the eyes.  “Climate change inflicted its own share of change on physics and may be harmful if care is not taken,” he says. He kicked against the claim that you can’t take a bath when it is raining, saying this is in the closet of the home and does not have direct contact with rain or lightning. Using Google search, Dubawa also discovered articles by a research institute, Insurance Information Institute in New York supporting the claim that wearing metal on your body during lightning can attract radiation harm to lives and that lightning also destroys electronics but can be protected with the use of surge suppressors if installed correctly. However, there is no research whatsoever to defend the claim that people should avoid taking baths when it is raining or stay away from mirrors and glass objects during rainstorms. It is true that lightning during thunderstorms can affect metallic objects, electronics and its hosts, especially if unprotected by surge protectors. It is also true that mirror and glass objects can reflect lightning to damage the eyes.  However, it is not true that ordinary rain without thunder and lightning will affect people and their property as suggested by the claimant. It is also not necessary to avoid taking bath during the rain without switching off the transformer, as experts have confirmed that transformers have built-in protectors. The National Orientation Agency has gone ahead to refute the originator of the claim and has issued a press statement to this effect on all its social media handles.

Claim: Facebook users are circulating an image of a man wearing police camouflage with the claim that he is a Kaduna State Deputy Commissioner of Police who was arrested with kidnappers when he went to supply them firearms.,"The picture of a man wearing a police camouflage in what appeared to be a Nigerian-styled parade of criminals is being circulated by social media users with the caption that he is an Assistant Commissioner of Police in Kaduna State. According to a Facebook post by Araba Kayode, it is the image of a Kaduna State Deputy Commissioner of Police and his accomplices after they were arrested while the alleged DCP was supplying weapons to kidnappers. Before this recent circulation, Ayonla MultiMedia had posted on April 13, 2021, the same image with the caption: “Kaduna State Deputy Commissioner of Police went to give arms to kidnappers, unfortunately, he was arrested with them. Hmm! Wonders shall never end. The post received over 1,000 comments and was shared over 12, 000 times.  Dubawa first traced the origin of the image by using Yandex Reverse Image search which revealed that the picture has been shared several times and goes as far back as 2019. The image was also traced to several counter narratives and even fact checks in the past that stated that the image of the alleged Deputy Commissioner of Police was fake. Several reports published in 2019 show that the man from the image in question was arrested in January 2019 for impersonating a police officer. Nigerian Police Spokesman, CP Frank Mba, who was then a Deputy Commissioner of Police had then said: “The suspect in Police uniform with the rank of an Assistant Commissioner of Police, is one Kingsley Udoyen, male, 56 years, of No 3, Stadium Road, Abak, Akwa Ibom State is a fake Police officer and not a serving Assistant Commissioner of Police.” For further clarification, Dubawa reached out to the Kaduna State Police Command which equally debunked the claim. The Command’s Public Relations Officer, ASP Mohammed Jalige, said the attention of the state’s command was drawn to what he described as “fake news making round on social media,” alleging that “Kaduna State Deputy Commissioner of Police went to give firearms to kidnappers; unfortunately, he was arrested with them.” ASP Jalige said the image in circulation was not that of any police officer in Kaduna Command or anywhere in Nigeria adding that: “The image with camouflage uniform wearing the rank of Assistant Commissioner of Police is one Kinsley Udoyem who was arrested and paraded by Akwa-Ibom Police Command on the 2nd January 2019 for the offence of impersonating a Police Officer.” He urged the public to disregard the fake claim and stop its circulation. This shows that the content with the image in circulation is fake; the man in the camouflage police uniform is an impersonator that was arrested in Akwa Ibom in 2019 and not in Kaduna State.

"Claim: A viral video showing several burnt bodies on WhatsApp claims that the Fulani bandits were struck, burnt and roasted by lightning from heaven while on their way to attack a Christian community in Northern Nigeria.","Claim: A viral video showing several burnt bodies on WhatsApp claims that the Fulani bandits were struck, burnt and roasted by lightning from heaven while on their way to attack a Christian community in Northern Nigeria. The video showing several burnt bodies on WhatsApp, with the claim that Fulani bandits were struck, burnt and roasted by lightning from heaven while on their way to attack a Christian community in Northern Nigeria is false as verification has revealed the bodies were from an accident that happened in Tanzania in 2019. Recently, a 29-seconds video was shared multiple times on WhatsApp purporting that Fulani bandits were struck, burnt and roasted by lightning from heaven while on their way to attack a Christian community in Northern Nigeria. The video showed numerous burnt corpses, burnt out wreckages of motorcycles piled together, voices in the background were heard speaking in an unrecognized language, and a huge burning fire and what appeared to be paid workers moving around. The video which looks like a tanker explosion scene was accompanied with the caption that reads: “Corpses of Fulani bandits as they were struck, burnt and roasted by lightning from heaven while on their way to attack a Christian community in the North. God is responding to the prayers of the church. It’s gory pls. Don’t bother to open pls it if you are sensitive to gory images” First of all, this reporter observed that the same video has been used to depict the Nigerian military onslaught on terrorists in Zamfara recently, which Dubawa tagged to be false. So this researcher went on to take screenshots of the video to capture relevant frames and subjected it to reverse image searches. Using reverse image tools Tineye and INVID  on the image yielded zero result. Further verifications on  Yandex reverse image search revealed that the video has been making the rounds since 2019, as it has appeared in several publications and Facebook pages, one of which was a post by Random FB videos on 5 September 2019, with the caption “This is provocative enough to cause war… South Africa,” indicating that it happened in South Africa. Another publication by norskk square space on 18 September 2021, with the title “South Africa a Failed State,” claimed that utter chaos and unfathomable violence and savagery is so common in African states, showcasing pictures it claims were images of the common genocides in Africa and that some of the frames were taken from this video. A keyword search revealed that the video was first shot in 2019 when an oil tanker explosion killed at least 60 people and wounded scores more in Tanzania. The tanker was heading from Dar es Salaam, Tanzania’s largest city to the country’s capital and overturned in the town of Morogoro,  according to an Aljazeera report. The report explained that the residents of the community besieged the area in an attempt to scoop fuel when the fuel tanker exploded and more than 60 lives were lost.  The video showing several burnt bodies on WhatsApp and claiming that Fulani bandits were struck, burnt and roasted by lightning from heaven while on their way to attack a Christian community in Northern Nigeria is false as verification has revealed that the accident happened in Tanzania and the video was shot in 2019 when an oil tanker exploded in Morogoro.

"Claim: Lawyer and human rights activist Chidi Odinkalu, recently claimed that the Senate President, Sen. Ahmad Lawan, is the single longest-serving legislator at the National Assembly since 1999.","On September 25, 2021, Chidi Odinkalu, claimed via his twitter handle that Sen. Ahmad Lawan is the single longest-serving legislator at the National Assembly since 1999. “What @DrAhmadLawan does not tell u is that he is the Doyen of @nassnigeria, as the single legislator who has been there continuously since 1999 without break. #GoFigure,” the professor and former chairman of National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), tweeted. Mr. Odinkalu’s post was in reference to a post by another twitter user, Dokun Ojomo (@DokunOjomo). Mr. Ojomo posted: “The Senate can’t stop Buhari from borrowing. Rather, past administrations should be blamed for not saving enough for the raining day.” ~ Senate President Ahmad Lawan.” In this quote credited to him, the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, backed the recent borrowings by the President Muhammadu Buhari administration, casting blame on past administrations for Nigeria’s current dwindling fiscal situation. The recent borrowing spree by the Buhari administration has drawn criticisms from Nigerians who have berated the National Assembly for the recent loan approvals, raising concerns over the country’s debt sustainability amid its rising debt profile. Many have described the legislature as a “rubber stamp,” adding that it had failed in its gatekeeping responsibility of checking the executive arm. However, the National Assembly had denied these claims, assuring them of due diligence: “What I want to assure Nigerians here is that we are not going to be frivolously supporting or approving loans for the executive arm of government,” the Senate President said in June 2021. President Buhari had on September 14, requested approval of the National Assembly to obtain fresh external loans of $4.054 billion and €710 million ($839 million), in addition to another request for grant components of $125 million in the 2018 – 2020 external rolling loan plans. Recall that earlier in May 2021, the President had also approached the legislature for approval to take a $6.18bn external loan to finance the N5.6 trillion deficits from the 2021 budget. Barely two months later, in July 2021, the Senate also received a loan request of N2.34 trillion ($6 billion), $8.3 billion and another €490 million. Nigeria’s total public debt stood at N35.46 trillion, as of September 2021, according to the Debt Management office (DMO). The decision by some members of the Buhari administration to blame past administrations for the country’s current financial woes has irked many Nigerians, including Mr. Odinkalu, who has pointed out that some members of the current administration, such as the Senate President, were also part of these past administrations. Referring to the Senate President’s recent reaction, one user, Godwin A. wrote: “It’s easy to continue casting blame on your predecessors, what are you currently doing to better the situation for the next? Abi what was your role in the Assembly during those years to avoid the current situation?” “How long will this man be in the senate? Choi! This COWntry na wa oh!” another user said, referring to Mr. Lawan’s long stint at the Nigerian Senate.  In his post, Mr. Odinkalu referred to Sen. Ahmad Lawan as “the single legislator who has been there continuously since 1999, without break.” In a bid to verify the claim by Mr. Odinkalu on Sen. Ahmad Lawan, Dubawa took a dive into the lawmaker’s journey at the National Assembly, and an analysis of the longest-serving lawmakers in the National Assembly – the Senate and House of Representatives. Born on January 12, 1959, Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan is a Nigerian Senator representing Yobe North Senatorial District under the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC). He was elected President of the 9th Senate in June 2019, after polling 79 votes to his contender, Ali Ndume’s 28. Lawan boasts of a parliamentary career spanning a stretch of 22 years at the National Assembly, having started his journey as a lawmaker at the House of Representatives in 1999, representing Bade/Jakusko Federal Constituency of Yobe State. He was reelected in 2003 and remained in this capacity till 2007, when he contested and was elected as a Senator to represent Yobe North Senatorial District. He lost a bid to become Senate President in 2015 to Bukola Saraki, in a dramatic turn of events. Two years later, Mr. Lawan became Senate Majority Leader, following the removal of Ali Ndume in 2017. He held the position till 2019 when he emerged as Senate President. While it is a fact that Sen. Ahmad Lawan had occupied a seat at the National Assembly since 1999, findings by Dubawa showed that he is not the only legislator with that feat. The Ijaw-born lawmaker currently represents Bomadi/Patani Federal Constituency of Delta State at the House of Representatives. Just like Mr. Lawan, Mr. Mutu remained at the National Assembly, since he was first elected in 1999, when Nigeria returned to civilian rule. He won re-election bids in 2003, 2007, 2011, 2015 and 2019 under the banner of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Mr. Mutu currently serves as the Chairman of the House Committee on Gas Resources. Contrary to Mr. Odinkalu’s claim, the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan (Yobe North), is NOT the single longest serving legislator at the National Assembly, since 1999. Dubawa found that a member of the House of Representatives, Nicholas Mutu (Bomadi/Patani), has also been a legislator at the National Assembly since 1999. Mr. Odinkalu would have been correct if he had referred to Ahmad Lawan as the single longest-serving “Senator” at the National Assembly since 1999, just as Nicholas Mutu holds the same record at the “Federal House of Representatives.”  ",FALSE-,30/09/2021,https://dubawa.org/is-ahmad-lawan-the-single-longest-serving-legislator-at-the-national-assembly/
"Claim: Former Aviation Minister, Femi Fani-Kayode, recently shared some photos to celebrate what he claimed to be scenes of an onslaught on bandits in Zamfara and other northern states by the Nigerian army.","Claim: Former Aviation Minister, Femi Fani-Kayode, recently shared some photos to celebrate what he claimed to be scenes of an onslaught on bandits in Zamfara and other northern states by the Nigerian army.  The pictures shared by the former minister are from separate events both within and outside the country. Some are at least four years old.  On September 7, former Minister of Aviation, Femi Fani-Kayode, took to social media handles to celebrate the victory of the Nigerian army over bandits in the northern states, particularly Zamfara where the government had declared a shutdown of telecommunication services. He attached pictures to a post that reads: “In Zamfara state and all over the core North today our brave fighters and gallant warriors are KICKING THE ARSE and beating the daylights out of the bloodthirsty killer bandits and blood-lusting murderous terrorists… This is like music to my ears! I am proud to be a Nigerian again! Keep going boys and hit them with all you have got. Thanks for your courage and sacrifice! Al Hamdu! Praise the LORD! Glory, Hallelujah! 👏💪❤💥💯💣👌✊👍🙏 🇳🇬”  This post has garnered over 1,000 likes and reshared by 176 people. The Nigeria Communications Commission had ordered network operators to suspend telecommunications networks in Zamfara State to disrupt communication by bandits. The network outage which started on September 3 and was initially planned to stop on September 17 has since continued, following an announcement by Governor Bello Matawalle of Zamfara State, noting that the ban on mobile telecommunications networks will remain until security personnel win the fight against insecurity in the state. Zamfara in Northwest Nigeria is one of the states worst hit by banditry in the country which has been attributed to the fact that it is mostly surrounded by forests (with little or no government presence) from where bandits launch their attacks on outlying towns, highways, and villages. In July, a survey conducted by SBM Intelligence showed that about 2, 371 persons have been abducted across the country within the first six months of the year. The report indicated that Niger State recorded the highest number of persons abducted, with 643 victims in 28 kidnap incidents, while 58 people were killed during the abductions. This was followed by Zamfara State with 519 kidnap victims in seven incidents leading to the death of 22 people, while Kaduna State recorded 360 kidnap victims in 26 incidents, leading to the deaths of 41 persons. Fani-Kayode’s social media applause comes amid his cross-carpeting to the All Progressives Congress from the Peoples Democratic Party.  Last Thursday, 16th of September, the former Minister of Aviation formally joined the APC.­ Prior to this, Fani-Kayode has taken to applauding APC governors and even the President, Muhammadu Buhari, whom he had, on several occasions, criticised.  A Google Reverse Image Search of the images showed that the photographs shared by Fani-Kayode to his 711 thousand followers on Facebook and 1 million followers on Twitter were taken from other platforms both within and outside the country.  Further checks by Dubawa revealed one of the photos dates back to 2017 as seen on the Defense Nigeria site alongside other pictures with the title, “Operation Lafya Dole: Ground Component.

Claim: A Facebook user claimed that Dubai was built with a $12billion infrastructure fund. He also claimed that $2.4 billion was set up by President Buhari as an infrastructure fund in Nigeria.,"A Nigerian social media user, Abdullahi Ayofe Olaniyi, in a Facebook post dated Wednesday, September 15, claimed that Dubai, a popular city in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), was built with a $12bn infrastructure fund in 2001. Olaniyi, whose bio identifies him as “Electrical Engineer, Media Consultant, Advocate of Governance” also describes himself as “Unrepentant Buharist & Tinubuist.”  Buharist and Tinubuist are terms used to describe loyalists to the political ideology of President Muhammadu Buhari and former Lagos governor, Bola Tinubu, who also is the All Progressives Congress (APC) national leader. “Dubai was built by $12billion infrastructure fund firm in 2001. The Nigerian replica of it with $2.4billion infrastructure fund set up by Buhari will begin operation in October 2021. “How many agitators know this? ‘Wọn kan npariwo oṣi kiri (they are just making noises),” he wrote. Olaniyi’s comment and claim came amid a whirlpool of reactions trailing President Muhammadu Buhari’s fresh request for fresh $4 billion and €710 million external loans. In a letter directed to the National Assembly (NASS) on Tuesday, September 14, President Muhammadu Buhari sought the country’s lawmaker assent to another loan fund of $4,054,476,863 billion and €710 million (approximately N2.2trillion) from bilateral and multilateral organisations to fund the deficit in the 2021 budget. The letter, which was originally dated August 24, was read by the Senate leader president who is by law the 9th NASS chairman, Senator Ahmed Lawan during a plenary.  While asking the lawmakers to approve grant components of $125 million, President Buhari said in the letter that the loan request is an addendum to the 2018-2020 borrowing plan.  projects listed in the addendum to the 2018-2021 Federal Government External Borrowing Plan, are to be financed through sovereign loans from the World Bank, French Development Agency (AFD), China-Exim Bank, International Fund For Agriculture Development (IFAD), Credit Suisse Group and Standard Chartered/China Export and Credit (SINOSURE) in the total sum of USD4,054,476,863.00 plus Euro 710, 000,000.00 grant component of USD 125,000,000.00,” part of the letter read. Apparently, this is not the first time the current APC-Buhari-led federal government would seek a loan either to finance the infrastructure or support the budget. In May 2021, the president requested a N2.343 trillion loan ($6.1 billion). According to him, the loan was meant to part-finance the budget deficit of N5.602 trillion in the 2021 budget.  The loan was eventually approved in July 2021 by the Senate, the upper legislative chamber,  despite outcry from concerned Nigerians. Prior to that, specifically in April 2021, the NASS approved loan requests of $1.5billion and €995million for the Buhari administration.  This came months after the loan request was made to enable the administration to finance the 2020 budget deficit, ‘critical projects.’ Dubawa’s check into the Debt Management Office (DMO) revealed that as of March 31, 2021, Nigeria has accrued a staggering debt figure of N33 trillion ($87 billion). In its 2019 ANNUAL NATIONAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS (DSA) published on Thursday, September 16, DMO claimed that the “external debt remains at a moderate risk of debt distress.” According to the federal agency, this is because “all the debt burden indicators, both the solvency and liquidity, remain below their respective thresholds throughout the projection period.” While DMO’s position appears to lessen the gravity of Nigeria’s expanding external debt profile, finance and economy experts, NGOs including Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project  (SERAP) and concerned Nigerians have been expressing strong worries over the country’s dangerous loan trend. Founded in 1833 by approximately 800 settlers from the Bani Yas tribe, Dubai which is situated on the Persian Gulf coast of the United Arab Emirates is the biggest city in the UAE and the capital of the Dubai Emirates. The city is known for luxury shopping, cherished tourist destinations, ultramodern architecture and a lively nightlife scene. Since the 20th century, it has served as a centre for regional and international trade. World Population Review reported that Dubai has a population of 2,921,376 and is UAE’s second largest by land area, measuring 4,114 square kilometres, and coming second only to Abu Dhabi, the capital of UAE. However, the population of Dubai is estimated to be 3,411,200 according to the 2020 population data released by the city’s government, a constitutional monarchy overseen by its ruler, His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum. With a GDP worth of USD$102.67 billion, Dubai’s economy relies on revenues from trade, tourism, aviation, real estate, and financial services. One of the jaw-dropping works of architecture in the city is the Burj Khalifa skyscraper, the tallest building in the world according to the Guinness World Records which has a total height of 829.8 m (2,722 ft, just over half a mile) and a roof height (excluding antenna but including a 244 m spire) of 828 m (2,717 ft). In 2021, Dubai was ranked the 5th safest city in the world by NUMBEO, a crowd-sourced global database of reported consumer prices, perceived crime rates, quality of health care, among other statistics. Claim 1: Does President Buhari set up $2.4 billion infrastructure funds? Dubawa’s findings established that on May 17, 2018, President Muhammadu Buhari approved the establishment of a Presidential Infrastructure Development Fund (PIDF).  According to the information released by the FG, the process is to be managed by the Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA) and invested specifically in critical road and power projects across the country. During the National Economic Council (NEC) meeting, the president also authorised the initial transfer of $650 million dollars to the NSIA from the Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas (NLNG) Dividend Account. Further findings also revealed that on February 12, 2021, President Buhari also approved the establishment of a Public-Private Partnership styled Infrastructure company named Infra-Co with an initial seed capital of N1 trillion. This came barely four months after the federal government announced it was planning to float N15trillion ($2.6billion) infrastructural funds. “Infra-Co will finance public asset development, rehabilitation and reconstruction as well as invest in cutting edge infrastructure projects for roads, rail, power and other key sectors,” President Muhammadu Buhari’s office said in a statement. Meanwhile, contrary to the $2.4 billion figure made in the claim made, the infrastructure fund set by President Buhari is $2.6 billion. Claim 2: Was Dubai built with a $12billion infrastructure fund in 2021? Verifying the claim made by the social media user, Dubawa ran a Google search with the SEO anchor words “$12 billion infrastructure funds Dubai.”  A multiple-link response provided by the search engine in relation to “$12 billion infrastructure funds” showed an article published on June 9, 2006, by Arab newspaper Khaleej Times with the headline “Emirates to raise $12b funds.” Details from the reports, however, indicated that the $12 billion was to be raised for six years for the airline’s aircraft acquisitions. A related report was contained in the Saudi Gazette of April 13, 2014, which projected that Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) investment in UAE “reaches” $12b and was projected to cross $14.4 billion. In respect to the year mentioned in the claim–2001, findings by Dubawa showed that truly in the 2000s, Dubai began to witness a sudden change in its economic and infrastructural plan– but not specifically in 2001. For instance in 2002, Dubai, as part of its development plan which was channelled towards tourism and real estate development, allowed foreigners to own real estate. The city, as a result of the new development, was announced by a global real estate consulting firm Jones Lang LaSalle as one of its “World Winning City,” a research program aimed at identifying the future’s most attractive property markets. This signposted a shift in the development of the city. Between 2004 and 2006, the Dubai government’s decision to diversify from a trade-based, oil-reliant economy to one that is service- and tourism-oriented has been massively paying off. Although there were challenges like the Great Recession which heavily affected property value, and led to Dubai’s foreign debt hitting $80 billion in February 2009, the bold move led to the construction of great buildings including  Emirates Towers, the Burj Khalifa, the Palm Islands and the most expensive hotel in the city, the Burj Al Arab. By 2015, there was a 12.5% increase in terms of new companies being registered in Dubai. As at the first quarter of the year, the growth has brought the total number of registered companies to 106,000 firms. A look into Dubai’s debt record showed that the worst moment in terms of the debt profile of Dubai was in November 2009 when the city’s foreign debt hit $80 billion which was occasioned by recession and a fall in property value. This came after a “historically long economic high-growth” period in the real estate sector of the country. Upon all this, there is no record that in 2001, the city was built with or by a $12bn infrastructure fund. Although Dubai’s economic transition which is reflected in its current growth took a flight in the 2000s, there is no record showing that the city was developed by/with $12 billion infrastructure funds.  Besides, the infrastructure fund set by President Buhari is $2.6 billion, not $2.4 billion. ",FALSE-,30/09/2021,https://dubawa.org/claim-dubai-was-built-with-12bn-infrastructure-fund-false/
Claim: A Facebook user is spreading a claim on social media that the National Identity Management Commission is giving out five gigabytes of data and ten thousand naira as part of an alleged “Verification Reward Programme.” The programme is claimed to be for those who have been using a phone sim card for more than three months on any network.,"Claim: A Facebook user is spreading a claim on social media that the National Identity Management Commission is giving out five gigabytes of data and ten thousand naira as part of an alleged “Verification Reward Programme.” The programme is claimed to be for those who have been using a phone sim card for more than three months on any network. Dubawa’s finding reveals that the claim is just a scam emanating from a Facebook user. The claim was widely shared on WhatsApp. While the claim cannot be found on the website or any of the social media handles of the National Identity Management Commission, the media unit of the commission has refuted the claim, saying anyone who applies does so at his or her own risk. A Facebook cum WhatsApp message going virile on social media claims that the National Identity Management Commission, NIMC, is running a verification reward programme. The program is presumed to be for those who have been using their sim card for more than three months. The claim states that deadline for the application of the reward programme is 30th of September 2021. It urged interested applicants to click a link to apply for the reward.  A click on the link led Dubawa to a page asking prospective applicants  to click a check button to find out whether they are qualified for the alleged reward. A second click on the page led Dubawa to another page with an instruction to enter your phone number. This is to find out whether applicants phone numbers have been selected to be among the two thousand, four hundred customers selected to receive the award.  The next click congratulated Dubawa and rolled out three steps to undergo to qualify. These include sending the link to twelve WhatsApp groups after which one will get the five gigabyte data and a sum of ten thousand naira within two minutes. These explains why it went viral with over five hundred shares, three hundred comments.  It also had a like and love emoji from a Joseph and Monica Akinyi. One Ernest Zibkere in his comment acknowledged the credit of the data. Another comment from Lydia Chioma states “ I followed all the verification steps and after two minutes, I found out that my MTN increased by ten thousand.” These are just a few among the comments running on the page. Since Dubawa was still verifying the authenticity of the claim, it did not click  further to avoid spreading fake news.  Screenshot of claim Dubawa started verification by visiting the website of the National Identity Management Commission and all its social media handles only to find out that there was no such claim on these platforms .A google search also revealed that no such claim existed. Dubawa finally put a call through  to the NIMC media office where one of the commission’s spokespersons, Hafsah Abdulrazaq, refuted the claim and rolled out a disclaimer: “The message did not emanate from NIMC and we are not party to it.” She added, “ Anyone who follows the link is at his own risk.”  Screenshot of NIMC scam alert It is not true that the National Identity Management Commission is running a verification reward programme. The two thousand and four hundred acclaimed winners are victims of a scam. All the social media handles and websites of NIMC do not advertise such a programme. And the media office of NIMC has also refuted the claim with a warning that whoever applies does so at his or her own risk.

Claim: A social media user claims the Nigerian Government has started the registration of all inmates in Nigeria’s correctional facilities for the upcoming general election and all prisoners are compelled to register for ID cards for the election including those on death row.,"Claim: A social media user claims the Nigerian Government has started the registration of all inmates in Nigeria’s correctional facilities for the upcoming general election and all prisoners are compelled to register for ID cards for the election including those on death row.  Findings show that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), which is the only legal entity with the powers to register Nigerian voters, is not capturing inmates at the country’s correctional facilities. Therefore, the claim is false.  On September 21, 2021 a Twitter user Media📝🎥:STANCITY WORLD#MNK with the handle @stancity44 posted two pictures of what appeared to be Nigerian inmates on twitter. While the first picture shows a group of men, some shirtless seated together, the second picture shows what appears to be Nigerian inmates lined up in their green uniforms while a staff of the correctional centre stood by.  The picture which had an accompanying text reads: “Breaking News! Nigerian Govt have finally started the registration of all inmates in the Nigerian correctional facility or prison for upcoming election. The prisoners are compelled to Register for an ID card for the election even those on death row.” With over 4,000 followers, Media📝🎥:STANCITY WORLD#MNK (@stancity44) who joined twitter in April 2020, is an ardent supporter of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and shares a lot of pro-IPOB messages on his handle. The said tweet was retweeted 44 times and liked 26 times.   In 2018, a Court of Appeal sitting in Benin affirmed a 2014 judgment of a Federal High Court which gave prisoners the right to vote in Nigeria’s elections. The court of appeal further directed the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to include all prisoners in the voter register. The ruling was granted in favour of the prayers by five inmates seeking an order to compel INEC to provide for enlistment of all prisoners in Nigeria in the voters’ register and full opportunity for them to vote in the then 2019 polls. However, Justice S. Oseji who delivered the judgement did not order INEC to liaise with the Nigeria Prisons Service to provide polling centres inside the country’s prisons as prayed for by the appellants. This reporter reached out to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) which according to Section 10(1) of the Electoral Act 2010 is the legal entity backed by law to register all persons qualified to be registered for voting. When contacted, Mr. Rotimi Oyekanmi, the Chief Press Secretary (CPS) to the INEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, said INEC is not capturing prison inmates for the on-going Continuous Voter Registration (CVR). “As of today (September 22nd) I am also not aware of any decision by the commission to do so before the 2023 General Elections,” Oyekanmi said. Dubawa also reached out to sources at the Nigerian Correctional Services and gathered that the authorities were actually registering inmates for the National Identification Number (NIN). There was, however, no mention of any ongoing voter registration at the correctional facility.  The Controller of Corrections Public Relations Officer, Francis Enobore, neither answered several calls to his phone when contacted did; nor did he reply to a text message on the issue. However, the PRO at the Kaduna Correctional Centre, Daniel Wadai, said there was no official communication to register inmates in the state and was therefore not aware of such a claim.   Dubawa noticed that the pictures used to accompany the text are popular online pictures that have been used numerous times by Nigerian media organisations and bloggers to depict the state of prison inmates or accompany stories on inmates in the country. Using Yandex reverse image search, it was revealed that the picture of the shirtless inmates first appeared online in 2013 in a story that depicted the state of prison inmates in Nigeria. The second picture is credited to Daily Trust newspapers and it is a picture of 19 out of the initial 28 suspects standing trial for the alleged murder of retired Maj. Gen. Idris Alkali in 2018. The picture was taken while the suspects were being led to a prison vehicle after their case was heard at the Plateau State High Court in Jos.  Based on information gathered from INEC and the Nigerian Correctional Service, inmates are at the moment not undergoing voter registration for the next general election scheduled to come up in 2023.

"Claim: Nicki Minaj, an American-Trinidadian rapper, recently made a post, via her Twitter page, suggesting that COVID-19 vaccine could cause impotence and swelling of the testicles.","On September 13, Nicki Minaj, a popular musician, posted via her Twitter page that her cousin had refused to take the COVID-19 vaccine because his friend who took it became impotent and ended up with swollen testicles.  She added that the said friend to her cousin was just weeks away from getting married when the incident happened, adding that because of the development, his bride called off their scheduled wedding.  In the post — which has garnered over 148,000 likes, 118,000 retweets and 44,000 comments — the rapper encouraged her followers to pray and ensure they are convinced before they take the vaccine. The music star wrote: “My cousin in Trinidad won’t get the vaccine cuz his friend got it & became impotent. His testicles became swollen. His friend was weeks away from getting married, now the girl called off the wedding. So just pray on it & make sure you’re comfortable with ur decision, not bullied.” Due to her status as a global pop star with far-reaching influence in countries such as Nigeria, her tweet further heightened fears of many about getting COVID-19 vaccine.  Minaj has over 227 million followers across Instagram, Twitter and Facebook pages. Her claim had come at a time when several forms of misinformation about COVID-19 vaccine are making the rounds on social media in several countries including Nigeria. As a result of the global impact of the virus, there has been an overwhelming amount of information on social media, websites and mainstream media about the virus with a mass audience willing to consume such pieces of information.  As with other disease outbreaks, the COVID-19 pandemic left people seeking answers to both professional and unprofessional means of prevention, symptoms, cures, and how this may possibly impact the way the world revolves.  However, the increased access to information resulted in the spread of misinformation.  For instance, In 2014 while the devastating Ebola epidemic raged in parts of West Africa, a viral WhatsApp broadcast prescribed bathing with or drinking salt and hot water mixtures as a “cure” for the dreaded disease.  Even though there was no medical basis for the claim, the “prescription” went viral enough for the government to have to officially debunk it. But that ultimately proved futile, as at least two people died and several others were hospitalized over excessive salt consumption.  The same tempo of misinformation applied to the effect of COVID-19 on Nigeria’s economy and people with influence ranging from religious leaders, among others.  Since the introduction of the COVID-19 vaccines, there have been conspiracy theories on the side effects of the vaccine on those who choose to get vaccinated.  Nigerian televangelist Christopher Oghenebrorie Okotie, who is also Pastor of the Household of God Church International Ministries, claimed in a viral video that taking the COVID-19 vaccine would turn recipients into vampires.  Also, founder of LoveWorld Incorporated, Pastor Chris Oyakhilome, said Christians should believe in the word of God rather than in the vaccine. Recently, some videos circulated the internet where some individuals alleged to have received the COVID vaccine claimed that when a LED bulb is placed against the spot where the vaccine is injected, it lights up. These claims have however been debunked.  Therefore, Minaj’s tweet has continued to ignite debate on the possible dangers around taking the vaccine across the world.  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the COVID-19 vaccines are effective at protecting people against severe disease and death from variants of the virus.  The centre acknowledges that after taking the vaccine, there is a probability of developing side effects, but noted that such are only temporary.  It also revealed that common side effects of the COVID-19 vaccines on people include: pain, redness and swelling on the spot where one gets injected. It added that those who have received the vaccine may experience tiredness, headache, muscle pain, chills, fever and nausea. “Serious side effects that could cause a long-term health problem are extremely unlikely following any vaccination, including COVID-19 vaccination,” it said. It, however, explicitly states that the vaccine does not affect impotence and swelling of the testicles as Minaj’s tweet claimed. It said: “Currently no evidence shows that any vaccines, including COVID-19 vaccines, cause male fertility problems. A recent small study of 45 healthy men who received an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (i.e., Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna) looked at sperm characteristics, like quantity and movement, before and after vaccination. Researchers found no significant changes in these sperm characteristics after vaccination. “Fever from illness has been associated with short-term decrease in sperm production in healthy men. Although fever can be a side effect of COVID-19 vaccination, there is no current evidence that fever after COVID-vaccination affects sperm production.” Similarly, Trinidad and Tobago Health Minister, Terrence Deyalsingh, has dismissed Minaj’s claim, describing the musician’s tweet as “false.” “As we stand now, there is absolutely no reported such side effect or adverse event of testicular swelling in Trinidad or, I dare say, anywhere else in the world,” he said. In an interview with CNN, Anthony Fauci, chief medical advisor to Joe Biden, US president, also faulted Minaj’s claim, saying her claim lacks evidence. “There’s no evidence that it happens, nor is there any mechanistic reason to imagine that it would happen. So the answer to your question is no,” he said. “There’s a lot of misinformation, mostly on social media, and the only way we know to counter mis- and disinformation is to provide a lot of correct information. “To essentially debunk these kinds of claims, which may be innocent on her part, I’m not blaming her for anything, but she should be thinking twice about propagating information that really has no basis.” Nicki Minaj’s tweet suggesting that COVID-19 vaccine could lead to impotence and swelling of the testicles is false. There is no scientific evidence to substantiate such a claim.

CLAIM: People should eat watermelon with the seeds as it contains vital nutrients essential to the body.,"Recently, a viral message on social media, especially on WhatsApp claimed that watermelon seeds are one of the most nutrient-dense varieties of seeds, which are rich in proteins, vitamins, magnesium, zinc and potassium which are all vital nutrients.  Many people in Africa believe in the efficacy of herbs in treating different diseases. These days, it is common to see claims about these cures on social media. While many of such claims may not be true, others are.  Watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) is a flowering plant species of the Cucurbitaceae family and the name of its edible fruit. A scrambling and trailing, vine-like plant, it was originally domesticated in Africa. It is a highly cultivated fruit worldwide, with more than 1,000 varieties.  Watermelon                                                                                          Source: Britanica.com  Watermelon is an incredibly hydrating fruit as it contains around 92 percent of water, and is enriched with a lot of essential minerals and vitamins. This succulent melon also contains a lot of seeds, which we generally throw away after consumption.  Dubawa researched why watermelon seed is believed to be an essential seed. A search on the website of Science Publishing Group, an independent international publisher of open access, online, peer-reviewed journals covers a wide range of academic disciplines.  The Group has a post in the International Journal on Nutrition and Food Nutrition containing research carried out by Faustina Dufie Wireko-Manu an Associate Professor in Food Science and Technology, Dr. Jacob K. Agbenorhevi a Senior Lecturer, Elsa I. Ompouma and Betty Tabiri, all of the Department of Food Science and Technology, Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST), Kumasi, Ghana.  The research titled ‘Watermelon Seeds as Food: Nutrient Composition, Phytochemicals and Antioxidant Activity’ was published on March 30, 2016.  Screenshot of journal  The research recognised the fact that watermelon seeds are often discarded while the fruit is eaten.  The study analyzed seeds of three varieties of watermelon (Charleston gray, Crimson sweet and Black diamond) for their proximate, minerals, phytochemicals, total phenols content and antioxidant activity.  The proximate analysis and phytochemicals screening were performed using standard procedures whereas mineral content was determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry.  Screenshots of findings  The study showed that watermelon seeds are a rich source of fibre and minerals that are essential in the body system.  The Dean, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Ilorin and a Professor of Food Science and Technology Mrs Yinka Ramota Karim, stated that the watermelon seeds contain a high level of magnesium which is essential for many of the body’s metabolic functions, maintains nerve and muscle functions as well as immune, heart and bone health. She added: “The seeds of the watermelon improves skin health by treating acne, blemishes, wrinkles and ageing, helps in strengthening the hair, improves heart health, boosts the immune system, improves male fertility, boosts energy levels among others.”  Similarly, a food nutritionist, Mrs Yejide Akinseyin stated that watermelon seeds are one of the secrets of nature that can be used for many things that benefits the body like a snack ( roasted and milled into flour for the production of snack), salad dressings, especially the oils expressed from it and smoothies.  “Although patients who are suffering from low blood sugar are advised not to consume much of this seed as it has the ability to further lower blood pressure which may lead to sudden death, apart from that the watermelon seed is very nutritious and safe for every healthy individual,” she said. An article posted in the Times of India highlighted the amazing health benefits of eating watermelon seeds which it describes as low in calories and offer an array of micronutrients like copper, zinc, potassium, magnesium, iron, folate etc; which have various health benefits. Some of them are listed below:  Watermelon seeds are also linked with stronger immunity and better health. Due to the presence of magnesium these seeds can also cure hypertension, which is directly related to heart health. Consumption of watermelon seeds daily in moderate quantities helps in boosting your heart health and maintaining your blood pressure.  Watermelon seeds have a high content of minerals like copper, manganese and potassium. And these minerals together with other micronutrients help in making our bones healthier. The seeds are linked with strengthening our bones and also improving bone density.  Watermelon seeds are a powerhouse of nutrients like folate, iron, zinc, copper, magnesium, potassium. These seeds are considered to be highly nutritious, as they are also rich in amino acids, proteins and vitamin B complex. All these nutrients together help in boosting your body’s metabolism.  They contain certain healthy fats which are extremely important for the body. Watermelon seeds are a good source of healthy fatty acids like oleic acid, linoleum which are required for proper functioning of the body.  These black seeds are really helpful in controlling diabetes. It is known to reduce the elevated blood sugar level and therefore can be a good snack option for patients with diabetes.  Watermelon seed oil is widely used as the main ingredient for cosmetic products that work wonders in treating acne and early signs of ageing. These seeds have antioxidants that help in reversing early skin ageing. Consumption of these seeds can provide your skin with an inner glow. Add a few seeds to your daily diet to get visibly healthy skin. Also, due to the presence of fatty acids, it prevents dryness and provides hydration to the damaged skin.  The seeds are filled with proteins and iron that are known to improve the texture and quality of hair. It helps in strengthening your hair strands and also promote hair growth. As the seeds are high in magnesium content, they make the hair healthy and in turn prevent hair fall and damage. Dry the watermelon seeds and roast them in a pan. Store them for many days in airtight containers. This can be a healthy yet delicious snacking option for those who always feel hungry. These will provide you a boost of nutrition and you can add these tiny seeds to your salads or other nuts for that added benefit. If you don’t want to eat it as a seed, then you can make it into a powder to enjoy the same flavour and benefits.  Given the evidence available, watermelon seeds are a rich source of fibre and minerals that are essential for the body. Watermelon seeds may provide considerable medicinal, health and economic benefits if freshly consumed or utilized in food products.

"Claim: A viral post on Facebook claims that Imo State University has been renamed Muhammadu Buhari University, Owerri.","Imo state is seen by many as the hub of the operation of the pro-Biafra group, the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) in Nigeria’s South-east since the agitation for the independent republic of Biafra started. So the August visit of President Buhari on 9 September 2021, to commission four newly executed projects in the state, triggered contrasting satires, claims and opinions on social media. Dubawa stumbled on one of such claims by @TenSquare Reports, a Facebook page. It claimed that Imo State University has been renamed Muhammadu Buhari University Owerri. This post has generated 211 comments and 145 shares as at 22 September 2021, the time of filing this report. Dubawa read the exchange of comments among users. While some believed and condemned the assumed act, others made a joke out of the post. Pascal Ase Larry in reaction condemned the Igbo tribe, apparently for allowing such action. His response reads in part, “Igbo kwenu! Hypocricy of d highest order. If it where (were) to be another south west or south suth (south) state that did this hypocrisy. we would have seen Igbo Facebook warriors criticizing, castigating, bombarding an calling names.” Another user, Fidelis Atubo, also tagged or painted it tribal.

Make we continue to take moni one day them go even collect our hand from us then there will be no hand to collect the moni again then eye’s go clear.” These replies triggered the urge to verify the authenticity of the claim. Since this post didn’t give full details on when and where Imo State University was renamed Muhammadu Buhari University Owerri and didn’t provide a link to the full story, this researcher decided to conduct a word search. And the result revealed that despite the threat by the (IPOB) few days earlier to disrupt President Muhammadu Buhari’s visit to Imo State, the president arrived Owerri, the state capital on 9 September, 2021, to commission four newly executed projects by Governor Hope Uzodinma’s administration. The president commissioned a polytechnic, a balloon technology-driven underground tunnel with surface drainage (Chukwuka Nwoha), Naze Road, and Nekede/Ihiagwa Road in addition to a newly-built exco Chambers within the Government House, known as the Douglas House and the Egbeada Bypass (Amakohia). The president held a town hall meeting with leaders of the five states in the  South-east geopolitical zone before departing for Abuja. At the time of filing this report, Dubawa didn’t get any public record in any credible platform to show that Imo State University has been renamed Muhammadu Buhari University Owerri. So this researcher contacted the Dean, Students Affairs, Imo State University, Professor Okee Okoro, to confirm the authenticity of this claim, and he said the claim is false. “This is very very very untrue, There was no such thing as that and would never be. The President never visited the school even when he came to Imo State a few weeks back, so I don’t know how they got this claim  that Imo State University has been renamed Muhammadu Buhari University Owerri.” Verification has revealed that President Mohammadu Buhari only visited Imo State to commission four newly executed projects and there is no evidence to suggest that Imo State University has been renamed Muhammadu Buhari University Owerri.

Claim: A video showing several charred bodies is circulated with the claim that the Nigerian Military in Zamfara killed several bandits and terrorists during the ongoing military operation in the state.,"Claim: A video showing several charred bodies is circulated with the claim that the Nigerian Military in Zamfara killed several bandits and terrorists during the ongoing military operation in the state.  The video that the Nigerian Military killed a lot of bandits or terrorists in Zamfara State is false as the video was shot in Tanzania, in 2019, when an oil tanker exploded in Moromoro, a city in Tanzania. Full Text   A 30 seconds video shared on WhatsApp depicts bandits/terrorists being “roasted” by the Nigerian Military during the ongoing military operation in Zamfara State. The video which shows numerous charred corpses and a huge burning fire also showed what appeared to be paid workers moving around.  The video also showed burnt out wreckages of motorcycles piled together while voices in the background were heard speaking in an unrecognizable language. Those sharing the video on WhatsApp did so with an accompanying caption which reads: “Bandits/terrorists roasted by the Nigerian military on 11/9/2021 in Zamfara.” The video, comes on the heels of the ongoing military onslaught to dislodge bandits/terrorists in Zamfara State and other parts of the North West.   The video is being shared on WhapsApp groups with the caption: “Bandita/terrorists roasted by the Nigerian military on 11/9/2021 in Zamfara.” Zamfara State, in north western Nigeria has in recent years become the epicenter of banditry  with abductions and killings of residents becoming a regular occurrence. To stem the tide, the governors of the northwest and that of Niger State in the north central put up certain security measures to dislodge and flush out heavily armed men terrorising communities in the region. Zamfara State first came up with the measures by closing down weekly village markets, banning the sale of petrol in Jerry cans and also the use of motorcycles in certain parts of the state. The measures were quickly replicated in Katsina, Kaduna, Niger and Sokoto states. On September 3, the Nigerian Communications Commissions directed all telecom providers to shut down services in Zamfara State. Prior to that, heavily-armed criminals in a daring attack stormed Government Day Secondary School, Kaya in Maradun LGA of the state where they abducted about 75 students who were released two weeks later in an undisclosed circumstance. As of September 6th, Nigerian troops backed by gunships and fighter jets had begun a massive offensive against kidnapping gangs and terrorists in the state. However, the military recently suffered a heavy casualty when 12 personnel died after gunmen overran a Forward Operations Base in Mutumji, Dansadau, near Gusau, the capital of Zamfara State.The attackers were said to have seized weapons from the killed service members and set ablaze other equipment in the facility. Premium Times reports that a source at the Defence Headquarters said, “Our troops are consolidating on successes recorded so far. Information on ongoing operations will be premature at this stage.” However sketchy information coming from Zamfara State opens room for speculations, especially among Nigerians eager to boast about the successes of the ongoing military operation in the state. Some media users, like the one under scrutiny, are sharing videos purportedly to boast that the Nigerian military is dealing a heavy blow to bandits/terrorists. To verify the video, our reporter took screenshots of the video to capture relevant frames which were then subjected to reverse image searches. Using Google Reverse Image Search and Tineye, the frames did not yield any tangible results. However, when the frames were subjected to Yandex reverse image search, the video appeared which was posted by Baron Myunkhauzen on April 10 2021h with an accompanying article in a foreign language. Upon further scrutiny, it was observed that the scene looked like that of a tanker explosion which prompted a keyword search on tanker explosions in Africa.     A key word search revealed that the same video appeared first in 2019 when an oil tanker heading from Dar es Salaam, Tanzania’s largest city to the country’s capital in Dadoma overturned in the town of Morogoro. Typical of several communities across Africa, Aljazeera reported that residents of the community besieged the area in an attempt to scoop fuel when the fuel tanker exploded and more than 60 lives were lost. Further searches revealed that images from the 2019 video were also published by other news outlets such as The Guardian and npr news.  The video of charred bodies being circulated on WhatsApp to depict the Nigerian Military onslaught on terrorists in Zamfara State is false, as the video was shot in 2019 after a tanker explosion in Tanzania, East Africa.

"Claim: Several Facebook posts claim the suspended Deputy Police Commissioner, Abba Kyari, has been exonerated and will soon assume his duties in the Nigerian Police Force.","Claim: Several Facebook posts claim the suspended Deputy Police Commissioner, Abba Kyari, has been exonerated and will soon assume his duties in the Nigerian Police Force. The claim that Abba Kyari has been exonerated and will soon assume his duties in the Nigerian Police Force is false. On Tuesday, September 21, several Facebook posts claimed that the suspended Deputy Police Commissioner, Abba Kyari, has been exonerated and will soon assume his duties in the Nigerian Police Force. The claim purportedly from the Times News insinuated that Kyari who is being investigated for allegedly receiving a bribe from a popular Instagram celebrity, Ramon Abbas, also known as Hushpuppi, committed no crime in the United States to warrant his extradition.   A Facebook post by Tori4Town with over 17,000 followers alleged that Abba Kyari will resume his duties soon as investigations show he didn’t commit the crime in the US. “BREAKING NEWS: According To The Times News , DCP Abba Kyari Will Resume His Duties In The Nigerian Police Soon As Investigations Proves “ He committed no crime on the soil of the US to warrant his extradition.” Another Facebook user, Emma Onye Nkuzi, went further to claim that the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) didn’t push for his extradition. The post reads: “#ME: I told my friends that DCP Abba Kyari will not be extradited to USA because the offense he committed was not on US soil and he is not a USA citizen,he was only indicted by FBI as someone who gets involved with stolen money and FBI never pushed for his extradition they just mentioned his name and one others.” To begin with, Dubawa visited the website of the Times News to which the claim was attributed and found that there is no story containing the details of the claim on the website. Dubawa also conducted a keyword search on the news and found that no credible media organisation has published reports on Abba Kyari being exonerated. To further verify the claim, Dubawa contacted the Police Public Relations Officer, Frank Mba, via calls and messages but is still awaiting a response. Further checks revealed that on July 26, 2021, the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) secured a court order to arrest Kyari and to hold him in U.S. custody for his role in the fraud perpetrated by Hushpuppi.  According to the US department of justice, international extradition is a legal process by which a person convicted or accused of committing a crime is transferred from one country to another country for prosecution or to serve a sentence following a conviction for a criminal offence.  The department further explained that international extradition in the United States is treaty-based, which means the United States must have an extradition treaty with the requesting country in order to consider the request for extradition. On December 22, 1931, Nigeria signed an extradition treaty with the United States. The treaty came into force on June 24, 1935, and was applicable to all British colonies, including Nigeria. Since then Nigeria has extradited several persons to the United States for various reasons ranging from drug, advance fee fraud, and terrorism-related offences Article 5 of the treaty between Nigeria and the United States states that extradition shall not take place if the accused person has already been tried and discharged or punished, or is still under trial in the territories of the High Contracting Party applied to, for the crime or offence for which his extradition is demanded.  Also, extradition will not take place if the accused person is still under examination or under punishment until the conclusion of the trial. Kyari is currently being investigated, hence the reason he cannot be extradited yet. If he is found guilty, Nigeria has the option of prosecuting him or handing him over to the US based on the existing treaty. However, on Thursday, August 27, the NPF Special Investigation Panel (SIP) investigating the fraud allegations levelled against Kyari submitted its report to the Inspector-General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba. The report contains the case file of the probe, evidence, findings as well as testimonies from DCP Abba Kyari and other persons and groups linked to the matter. While giving an update on Kyari’s extradition, the Police Affairs Minister, Muhammad Maigari Dingyadi, in an interview on Tuesday, September 14, explained that the final decision on the request for extradition of Kyari would be taken only by President Muhammadu Buhari. He added that the report submitted to the IGP has also been forwarded to the minister of justice for a legal opinion before a final action is taken by the president. “We have also reported that the committee has submitted its report to the Inspector General of Police.  We have also submitted this report and recommendations to the Attorney-General of the Federation for a legal opinion.  Thereafter, we will take it to Mr President for final consideration. “So, you can see that though this matter is a local matter here, it has some international connotations.  We have to do some due diligence to ensure that we do the right thing. We have to do some consultations with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Justice before a final decision will be taken. “What is important is that Nigerians should know that the police management is up and doing and it has done what it is supposed to do. I hope people will wait and see what actions will be taken on this matter,” he said. The claim that Abba Kyari has been exonerated and will soon assume his duties in the Nigerian Police Force is false.

"Claim: Claim on the WhatsApp platform of a reputable news organization is that it costs only N2,600 to travel by train from Lagos to Kano and “a little more” for the first class ticket for a journey of over 834 km.","A WhatsApp user recently shared on a reputable news group claims that a train ticket costs N2,600 to travel by train from Lagos to Kano with a distance of over 834km.  His message reads, “Finally, the Friday train from Lagos to Kano has left Idu Terminus. The over 834 km Journey will only cost travellers NGN2,600, and just a little more for the first class section which provides better comfort with AC. The narrow railway that was built in 1912 was recently rehabilitated.”  With various individuals on the same platform, the message has the sort of appeal that has motivated users to start sharing the message on other groups and on social media. This may impact on decisions on travel by train along this route.  On August 8th 2021, the Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) said that the Lagos-Kano train service will go into operation from Friday August 13 in a statement by Ismail Adebiyi, regional district manager, NRC. Speaking in Zaria, Kaduna State, he said the train would leave Lagos on Friday evening of the said date and arrive in Kano on Sunday morning.  However, on Thursday August 12th 2021, a day before the scheduled take-off operation, it announced the postponement of the Lagos-Kano train service due to a damaged rail track. Fidet Okhiria, Managing Director, NRC, said this in a statement made available to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos on Thursday. He said the damage to the rail track was caused by a downpour around the Power Line in Osogbo, Osun state, during the week. The statement said a team of experts from NRC had mobilised to the site and was working round the clock to restore the damaged track. An inquiry sent to the NRC official email [email protected] as displayed on its official website https://nrc.gov.ng/ on weekday was not responded to. Similarly, the official mobile contact of the NRC +(234) 90 600 30 422 did not connect as it was either “not reachable,” or “switched off.” However, an online search reveals that the Lagos to Kano train service resumed operation on Friday 3rd September 2021 and will only operate weekly – every Friday specifically – which was reported by the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), Punch, Vanguard and other credible news platforms.  At the maiden take-off operation, the Lagos District Manager of the NRC, Mr Jerry Oche, announced that, “the train ticket fee to various stations is as follows: from Lagos to Abeokuta on First Class is N450 while Economy class is N350; Ibadan to Lagos on first class is N850 while the economy is N550; Osogbo between N1,1250 and N850; Offa between N1,450 and N950; Ilorin N1,650 and N1,100 while Jebba, N2,050 and N1,300; from Mokwa is between N2,200 and N1,450; Kutiwengi N2,500 and N1,650; Akerri N2,650 and N1,750; Minna N2,800 and N1,850; Serikinpawa N3,050 and N1,950; Kaduna Junction N3,700 and 2,400; Zaria N4,000 and N2, 600 while the last station is Kano with a fee of between N4,600 and N2,950.” The train will stop at 16 different stations between 97 kilometers to Abeokuta and 1,126 kilometers to Kano,” Oche said. Following efforts by this fact-check to obtain the facts on the NRCs official website and other publicly available contacts – phone number and email, it turns out that the website https://nrc.gov.ng/ has not been updated with the latest train service schedule from Lagos to Kano.  Even the e-ticketing web platform https://nrc.tps.ng/ has not been updated with a selection option that will enable intending travellers to click and purchase tickets online. Furthermore, the timetable on https://nrc.tps.ng/time-tables and https://nrc.gov.ng/schedules/ has not been updated to reflect resumption of the train service from Lagos to Kano. According to website developers, every web page on the internet has three important dates attached to it. The first is its published date. This is when the author of the page originally published the content on the web. The second is the last updated/modified date. This is when the author last updated the web page. The third is the indexed date. This is the most recent date that search engines crawlers indexed the page for search results. Using the GoDaddy WhoIs database query, it was discovered that the NRC website was last updated in August 2016.  In the same vein, the publicly available email and phone number seem inactive as messages were not replied to or calls  fail to connect to official phone numbers.  Even though recent developments about timetable for the Lagos- Kano train service have not been updated on the official the NRC website https://nrc.tps.ng/ and e-ticketing https://nrc.tps.ng/time-tables platform, official statements and comments available on credible news platforms prove that the ticket for Lagos-Kano train service costs more than NGN2,600.

Claim: Too much stress causes typhoid,"In Nigeria, it has become a common assumption that whenever a person is sick and diagnosed with typhoid, it is often attributed to stress and such a person would be advised to try to rest well. A Twitter user known as Code and vibes (@pharuc1) wrote that the stress from commuting from mainland Lagos to Island has made him sick with typhoid.  He wrote, “Abeg who dey work for Island wey dey ply Oshodi, Gbagada or Oworo? make i join am abeg, i don’t mind paying monthly ‘owo epo”…  Just one week from mainland to island stress, full blown typhoid knocked me down.” Another tweeter known as Oyindamola ( @portable_wendy1), who lamented of not being paid by her boss in a thread of tweets, narrated that she got down with typhoid as a result of the stress she went through having commuted from Sango-Ota, Ogun State to Yaba, Lagos State.  Oyindamola wrote, “On the 25th of September, I fell seriously ill & I was rushed to the hospital. After a series of tests; I was diagnosed with typhoid due to stress. I was going from Ota to Yaba every single day and my mum helped me with transport fare.” Typhoid explained  According to the  popular medical news website, MedicalNewsToday, typhoid is a bacterial infection that can lead to a high fever, diarrhea, and vomiting. It can be fatal. It is caused by the bacteria salmonella typhi. The infection is often passed on through contaminated food and drinking water, and it is more prevalent in places where handwashing is less frequent. It can also be passed on by carriers who do not know they carry the bacteria. In the same manner, webmd.com describes typhoid as an acute illness associated with fever caused by the salmonella enterica serotype typhi bacteria. It can also be caused by salmonella paratyphi, a related bacterium that usually causes a less severe illness. The bacteria are deposited in water or food by a human carrier and are then spread to other people in the area. According to Asian Pacific Journal of Tropical Medicine, typhoid incidence ranges from 3.9% to 18.6%. A gastroenterologist, Dr. Seyi Akande, explained in an interview with this fact-checker that typhoid is contracted when infected faeces contaminate the food, hand or drink of another person. According to him, the microorganism responsible for that typhoid known as salmonella gets into the body through the mouth and gets out through faeces. He explained, “Salmonella typhi is a microorganism that is found in faeces. So, whenever you have an unhygienic condition there are chances of spread of typhoid.  For instance, if the water is close to where the toilet is or people that are handling food go to the toilet and don’t wash their hands. Or people that have long nails allow faeces and dirt to hide under the nails and use those hands to cook food then one can get infected by eating the food. That is why it is important to do typhoid tests for food handlers before you certify fit to offer food service.  “Anything that will make people ingest food or water that is contaminated through the mouth can lead to typhoid, even though it is not every time that people get down with the disease because the body has a general way of fighting these diseases. For instance, the stomach is acidic so this acidity kills a lot of these typhoid bacteria. But if they are many, some can escape this acidity and get to the small intestine then to the body.  Unhygienic conditions lead to typhoid,” Dr. Akande added. The gastroenterologist further explained that typhoid is diagnosed first and foremost by the symptoms the patient presents. If the patients have continuous fever, not the intermittent one.  The intermittent fever can come in the morning and you don’t see it again in the evening, that is common to malaria but the typhoid fever is continuous. Also, a person with typhoid will have headache, commonly they will have abdominal pain. Sometimes, they could have constipation or pass stool less frequently. They may also have diarrhea. Usually because we are dark skin, we might not easily see the rashes that typhoid causes but in those that are light skinned, you will suspect that a patient is having typhoid.  Dr. Akande added, “Then there are tests that you can then do. For instance, you can take blood samples of the patient and do salmonella typhi not that widal test. You can take the stool or urine of the patient depending on how long the patient has been having symptoms whether the first, second week, or whenever.  Akande said that the foregoing question is one of the problems in Nigeria with the diagnosis of typhoid.  He stated, “We call some doctors malaria-typhoid doctors because once there is fever; they will think it is either malaria or typhoid.  It is good to think of malaria because it is common in our community but it is not every fever that is typhoid. The notion that whenever you treat malaria and it doesn’t go then you have typhoid is very wrong.” In the same vein, Dr Tunji Akintade, a general physician and the immediate past president of the Lagos Chapter of the Association of General and Private Medical Practitioners of Nigeria, also corroborated his colleague that typhoid is an infection caused by bacteria called salmonella.  He further explained that the signs and symptoms of this disease are fever(hotness of the body), severe headache, abdominal pain among others. “Complications that can arise from it include intestinal perforation, psychosis and severe anaemia. All these(disease + complications) are stressor to the human body. Let me categorically state for educational purposes. Diagnosis of typhoid is both clinical and laboratory. The laboratory aspect of it is blood culture, not widal test,” the medical practitioner explained.   Akintade explained that the corresponding response will be based on clinical evidence seen. These responses may include further investigation or intervention which can be surgery,  blood transfusion, or even all of the above. He said, “prevention of this illness is basically water hygiene not drugs. Vaccines has also been useful.” The doctor explained, “Stress itself is defined as a state of mental or emotional strain or tension caused by adverse (physical, biological or chemical) circumstances. “Stress on its own can easily be handled by identifying the stressor which like I said above can be biological, physical or chemical. Once you identify it, you remove it before it tampers with your emotional or mental state. “Resting plays a major role in all stressor but it has to be in addition to removing the stressor. When you rest, you conserve energy, build up your immunity and your protein store and you get well hydrated.” Akande empathetically said that stress does not in any way cause typhoid.   He said, “Typhoid is not caused by stress. Typhoid is caused by a biological organism called salmonella. It is the cause of typhoid that is a biological stressor. “In the above subject matter, the cause of typhoid is biological (bacteria) triggering chemical and emotional circumstances.” Typhoid is not caused by stress, rather it is caused by a microorganism known as salmonella typhi.

Claim: A WhatsApp message with a shortened url link directs Nigerians to apply for the Federal Government Jubilee Fellowship in 2021.,"Unemployment is a global issue, but in a country with a high youth population like Nigeria, unemployment can be a serious source of concern. Bloomberg estimates that the unemployment rate in Nigeria rose to 33% in the last quarter of 2020. The Federal Government has been making efforts to curb this challenge with various employment and empowerment schemes for its young citizens like the N-Power programme.  In September 2021, a message with the information that the Federal Government had opened a portal for graduates to apply for the Nigeria Jubilee Fellows Programme (NJFP) was shared on WhatsApp. The message states that the programme is also open to foreigners from “Ghana, Kenya, South Africa, and Cameroon” and that fellows will be paid ₦80,500 monthly and urges them to “apply now.” The message then provided a link for applicants to apply for the scheme. Members of the WhatsApp group on which the message was shared expressed their reservations that the message might be false due to past experiences and Dubawa, therefore, decided to fact-check the claim. The Nigerian Government is partnering with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the European Union (EU) to provide employment to 20,000 young Nigerian graduates under the Nigeria Jubilee Fellows Programme (NJFP). The government claims that unlike other similar initiatives “that tend to require some sort of advanced requirement from applicants or lower the entry bar in terms of the kind of opportunities that are available,” the NJFP “does the opposite by inviting qualified applicants across a level playing field without compromising the pedigree of organizations that will play host to successful Fellows.” The programme also promises to place fellows in private and public sector organisations across various industries. While Nigerians are excited about the opportunities, many are nonetheless wary as they have been deceived previously by offers of fraudulent schemes or those purportedly from the government. In June 2021, a viral WhatsApp message claimed the Federal Government was distributing ₦200,000 grants to businesses while another phishing website (in December, 2020) claimed the Federal Government was recruiting 50,000 youths while yet another (in November, 2020) claimed the Federal Government was giving grants to support Nigerians. Dubawa clicked on the phishing/fraudulent website- https://tinyurl.com/Apply-FG-Jubilee-Programme severally without success. Dubawa then verified the Nigeria Jubilee Fellows Programme (NJFP) website and also sought information through ‘Villa Updates,’ a verified Telegram platform of the Nigerian Government’s State House where information is shared to citizens. ‘Villa Updates’ on Telegram has close to 44,000 subscribers.  ‘Villa Update’ shared a message on September 14, 2021, confirming the information that applications have opened for  the President Buhari launched Nigeria Jubilee Fellows Programme and that applications will close on October 20, 2021. The message also states that the application process “does not charge a fee at any stage of the application or work placement process”. It, therefore, discourages applicants from applying through fraudulent websites and advises them to apply “through the website for the programme: www.njfp.ng. The disclaimer was also shared online. The Nigeria Jubilee Fellows Programme (NJFP) is real but applicants should only apply through the verified website which is www.njfp.ng ",MOSTLY-FALSE,23/09/2021,https://dubawa.org/the-nigeria-jubilee-fellows-programme-is-real-but-beware-of-phishing-websites/

The form consists of name, residential address, phone number, email address, date of birth, name of institution and matric number with a Yes or No button at the end just before the Apply now button. However, without filling the form, the reporter clicked the ‘Apply Now’ button and it led to another page which asks questions like if the student is a Nigerian, the region the student is based, and what will the money be used for. After answering the questions, it brought a congratulatory message and some Facebook comments of purported beneficiaries writing good reviews about the grant scheme. The congratulatory message also asked the reporter to do the following things before getting credited;  “Congratulations, you are eligible for the ₦30,000 TETFUND GRANT. How to get your ₦30,000 credited to your account 1. Before you continue, click the green button “SHARE” and send this to 5 WhatsApp Groups (Only Groups) for other members to benefit from this. After sharing, an account number and bank name to receive the ₦30,000 was requested. Further findings show that the website is not related to the MDA responsible for tertiary education in the country as it does not have its URL extension ending with gov.ng like all MDAs of the Nigerian government. The original website of TETFUND is tetfund.gov.ng as its original website address. We further analysed the website using Whois, which is a query and response tool used for searching databases that store registered users and assignees of an internet resource such as domain name, IP address block and a wide range of other information. Whois.domaintools.com employed showed that the website’s main domain was claimoffer.net registered August 25, 2021 with a website title “Jumia 9ja shopping festival promo.” The current IP location is New Jersey, USA.

There is no scientific evidence that proves mixing kola nuts with garlic, ginger and lime water can cure menstrual problems. A Facebook blog on health, wellness and skincare by the name Faida Babale claims the use of four kola nuts, ginger, garlic cut and bottled together with lime juice and honey can resolve menstrual problems when taken two days after fermentation. With kola nut the major ingredients and a picture of kola nut posted in the article, the post was shared more than 2,000 times and commented on by more than 700 people.  The post which was also liked over 2,000 times has gathered mixed reviews with some Facebook users showing interest and asking for additional information while others called for caution and advised women to be careful with the kind of concoction they consume.   Menstrual problems or disorders are disruptive physical and/or emotional symptoms just before and during menstruation, including heavy bleeding, missed periods and unmanageable mood swings. There are many types of menstrual related problems that affect women but the major ones are:  According to research, menstrual irregularities occur in an estimated 14% to 25% of women of childbearing age. Kola nut belongs to the plant family Sterculiaceae with about 125 species of trees native to the tropical rainforests of Africa. Of these species, the most common in Nigeria are cola nitida with two phenotypic varieties; the white and red cultivars, cola acuminata and garcinia cola and buchholzia coriacea popularly known as wonderful kola. According to a 2012 research review by Adebayo S.A and Oladele O.I titled: “Medicinal Values of Kolanut in Nigeria: Implication for Extension Service Delivery,” Nigeria accounts for about 70 percent of the total world production of kola nuts with about 90% of the kola produced in Nigeria consumed within the country while 10% is exported.  The review explained that kola is highly valued for its perceived medicinal attributes which make it a highly desired product. It contains large amounts of caffeine and theobromine and are therefore used as a stimulant that produces a strong state of euphoria and well being, enhance alertness and physical energy, elevate mood, increase tactile sensitivity, suppress appetite and hunger and are used as an aphrodisiac. Ginger, also known as Zingiber officinale, is a flowering plant whose rhizome, ginger root, is widely used as a spice and a folk medicine. Ginger has been widely used in traditional medicine, and therefore there are many scientific studies examining its medical value. Research suggests that eating ginger provides multiple health benefits including relieving some types of pain.  Garlic (Allium sativum) is a species of bulbous flowering plant in the onion genus Allium. Garlic is widely used for several conditions linked to the blood system and heart, including atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries), high cholesterol, heart attack, coronary heart disease, and hypertension. Limes are citrus fruits which are typically round, green in color, and contain acidic juice vesicles. Limes are said to be nutritional powerhouses as they are high in vitamin C, antioxidants, and other nutrients. Because limes are loaded with nutrients, they may help boost your immunity, reduce heart disease risk factors, prevent kidney stones, aid iron absorption, and promote healthy skin. Dubawa conducted a keyword search and found some articles on kola nuts. A recent review on kola nut consumption, its benefits and side effects published in 2020 in the “World Journal of Advanced Research and Reviews” states that kola nuts have been researched to have many health benefits, however, they still have some effects which when consumed in large quantities are dangerous. The research however linked stories about the many health benefits of kola nut to thousands of years and states that though kolanut is likely safe for most people when consumed in amounts found in foods, it may not be appropriate for everyone. There was however little or no specific research about kola nuts and menstrual problems even though some researchers say most claims about kola nuts should be seen as folklore because they are yet to be scientifically researched and proven.  Research on “Effect of ginger (Zingiber officinale) on heavy menstrual bleeding: a placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial” reveals that ginger may be considered as an effective therapeutic option for heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB). Another study shows that ginger can be widely used in the treatment of premenstrual syndrome. While there is little or no research directly on garlic and menstruation-related problems, taking lime juice just before periods could be said to delay menstrual flow or make them lighter.    Safwan Ismaila Idris, a lecturer with the department of Biological Sciences from the Bauchi State University, said there is no research that proves that kola nuts have certain properties that could cure menstrual problems. Idris said most assertions about the use of kola nuts to cure diseases are traditional. “Normally in plants, we look at bioactive compounds to know their medicinal values and these bioactive compounds promote health in humans. In the case of kola nuts, it’s mainly composed of caffeine which is a flavour in most beverages and a stimulant that activates metabolism. But the issue of combining ginger, garlic and lime, that is kind of complicated.” “I’ve not come across any research that talks about these combinations to cure menstrual related problems and sometimes when you mix up all these things, there could be side effects. Some of the components may have adverse reactions to the body,” he said.  Also speaking, Jos based consultant Obstetrics and Gynaecologist, Dr. Maimuna Hassan, said there is no research on how combining kola nuts, ginger, garlic and lime cures menstrual problems but stated that lime in particular which is taken in weight loss could affect ovulation in women. Dr. Hassan added: “There is no study that shows outrightly that lime itself can regularise menstruation on its own but taking it can affect fertility because it can disrupt the final process of ovulation. “For the kola nut, there is also no study to show that it regularises menstruation, most of these things are based on hearsay and myths and as Africans, we don’t like to take the orthodox medicine.” Though there are few articles that claim that spices such as ginger could relieve pain including those related to menstrual cycle, there is little or no scientific evidence about how kola nut, garlic and lime when mixed together with ginger could cure menstrual problems.    The researcher produced this fact-check per the Dubawa 2020 Fellowship in partnership with Daily Trust newspapers to facilitate the ethos of truth in journalism and enhance media literacy in the country.

"Claim: During the official commissioning of the Office of the First Lady of Kano State, an official statement posted on the official Facebook page of the Kano State Governor claims that there are more women inclusion in governance in Kano State than any other state in the country.","Kano State governor, Dr. Umar Ganduje, commissioned in August the Office of the First Lady in the state  as part of his commitment to improving the life of women, strengthening their political inclusion and participation in governance. The commissioned Office of the Wife of the Governor is located at Ten Chalets section of the Government House, Kano. He said the office is dedicated to women development in Kano and as compliment to the effort of his wife, Prof. Hafsat Abdullahi Ganduje who, according to the governor, works tirelessly for their empowerment. In a statement on his Facebook page titled Office Of The Wife Of The Governor: When Readiness To Serve Came Before Office,  shortly after the ceremony, the state government claimed that there are more women included in governance in Kano State than any other state in the country.  “Prof Hafsat Umar Ganduje has been at the forefront of campaigns for women inclusion in governance. The result is that there are more women in governance in Kano State than any other state in the country,” the statement reads in part.  This fact-checker tried to reach the state government to contextualise the meaning of its assertion that there are more women in governance in Kano than any other state, but the effort was abortive as calls put through to the Press Secretary to the Kano State Government, Abba Anwar, were not answered. Follow up SMS and WhatsApp messages were also not responded to. However, Fatima Musa Aliyu, the Acting Executive Director, Bridge Connect Africa Initiative (BCAI) , an organization focusing on women’s rights and girl child education among others, explains that indicators for women inclusion are usually judged based on the specific focus of a program.  “If you say an economic programme for example, you would be looking at indicators like, is there a task force in the team, if there is, what is the gender balance, if it is in the workplace, are there provisions for menstrual pads, is there maternity leave and so on,” she explains.  However, in terms of governance and inclusion, she said that cabinet composition is a key indicator: “In this case, you would be looking at how many women commissioners are there in the cabinet, what is the composition of the top tier management who take decisions on behalf of women, how many percent of the appointment goes to the women, these are all things about governance and inclusion that are indicators. People would want to look more at the executive positions, because it is a reflection of the society in terms of gender bias and every other thing.”  Based on the foregoing yardstick, findings by PRNigeria show that on 5th November, 2019, the Kano State Government swore in its 21 member state executive council and assigned portfolios to them with only two females – Dr. Zahara’u Umar as Commissioner of Women Affairs and Dr. Mariya Mahmoud Bunkure as Commissioner of Higher Education – making the cabinet, representing only 9.52% of the cabinet makeup which is far below the formulated National Gender Policy of 35% affirmative action of women in public governance and leadership.  Further checks show that states like Lagos have a higher number of women (14) in their cabinet and Gov. Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State was recognized for being the first state governor to include 14 women in his cabinet representing 40% of the cabinet make up.  Dr Joe Okei-Odumakin, a Nigerian women’s rights activist, president of the human rights groups, Women Arise for Change Initiative and the Campaign for Democracy has in reaction to that, urged other state governors to emulate Gov. Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State by ensuring an increased number of women in their cabinets. NAN reports that Gov. Sanwo-Olu had in August 2019 inaugurated 35 commissioners and special advisers into the state executive council out of which 12 were women. One of the three governor’s nominees, who was declined confirmation by the Lagos State House of Assembly, was also a woman making the number 13. The governor had earlier appointed a woman, Mrs Folashade Jaji, as the Secretary to the State Government bringing the number of women to 14 altogether. Similarly, in March 2020, Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq, Governor of Nigeria’s north-central Kwara State, was reported to have gone down in history as the first African leader with the highest number of female cabinet members and political appointees.  This is because nine of his 16-person cabinet picks are women, way higher than the 35% affirmative action sought by the Beijing Declaration.  Even though the total number of cabinet make up varies between 16 and 35 depending on states in terms of number of women appointees, Lagos remains ahead (14) followed by Kwara (9) but in terms of percentage based on total number of cabinet members, Kwara is ahead with 52.25% followed by Lagos with 40% while Kano (9.52%) lags behind on both factors.  Furthermore, out of the 36 States in Nigeria, only 4 have Deputy Governors that are women namely; ·         Ogun State: Mrs Salako-Oyedele Noimot Olurotimi   ·         Rivers:  Mrs Ipalibo Gogo Banigo ·         Kaduna: Mrs Hadiza Balarabe ·         Enugu: Mrs Cecilia Ezeilo This is approximately 12% representation and below the 35% affirmative action for gender inclusion in Nigeria, and Kano is nowhere near the record.  A cursory view of State Cabinets across geopolitical zones reveals the following statistics from six samples of each geopolitical zone in terms of gender inclusion.  The Lagos State cabinet led by Governor Babajide Sanwoolu has thirty-five (35) members with 14 female members. This represents a 40% gender inclusion level which is commendable and above the 35% affirmation agenda.  From the Akwa Ibom State cabinet which has 21 members, only two (2) women made the list which in terms of percentage distribution is about 10.5%. In Imo State Governor Emeka Ihedioha inaugurated his 17-man cabinet with two(2) women making the list like Akwa Ibom state. This translates to 8.5% in terms of gender distribution in the cabinet.  Governor Nasir El-Rufai inaugurated his 11-man cabinet which has four(4) women in the list. This number shows that the gender representation is 27.5% The Borno state cabinet has 22 members and out of the executive council, there  are two  (2) women in the list. This by gender representation is 11% and again very low when it comes to 35% affirmation in terms of participation in governance.  From the North-Central with focus on Benue State, Governor Samuel Ortom’s 15-man cabinet, has two (2) women in the list like Akwa-Ibom, Borno and Imo states. This makes a gender representation of 7.5% which is far behind the 35% affirmative action. Lawyers, journalists, gender rights activists and political scientists in Kano all confirm that the state is not the most gender inclusive state in Nigeria in terms of governance as claimed.  Zainab Nasir Ahmad, a gender rights activist and executive director Youth Society for the Prevention of Infectious Diseases and Social Vices (YOSPIS), thinks gender inclusion in Kano State is a great challenge. “From the side of women I can say the chances are not there as they are suppose to be, the female gender is struggling because of lack of support people that can pushed them up. On the other hand, the current kano state Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, once narrated how some women were denied top positions because how tasking the job is and there are complaints from the married women based on the reasons that they can’t leave their husbands to actively participate in public space due to cultural barriers,” Zainab said.  Another women rights activist and reporter with Guarantee FM Kano, Hannatu Sulaiman Abba, blames the situation on misconceived religious perceptions and societal norms.  “Many women have been bullied, mocked and embarrassed just because they go into politics as a career,” Hannatu quipped.  But Barrister Nura Ahmad Muhammad, a Lawyer and founder of Mufarka Youth Initiative, explains this further, saying the expectation upon every woman in Hausa Land is to be a good wife, decent, chaste and obedient. “It is a restriction in the eyes of the modern world but culturally alright in the Hausa community, this is cultural relativism. What is important is to keep adjusting culturally in terms of women’s engagements in Hausa land, accepting changes that are morally good and important to our day to day activities. Moving with time and accepting changes facilitates progress. At the same time we need to preserve our culture, package it well, showcase it globally and always be proud of it. Our culture is our identity, we can’t afford to lose it,” he stated.  Nigeria is Africa’s largest and most densely populated nation with over 180 million people of over 250 ethnic groups. According to the World Data report in 2017,  the population of women was 94.2m, constituting over 45% of the population.  This shows that women in terms of population spread are critical in the development of the nation. This is not reflected as expected in the distribution or participation of women in sectors like energy, business, banking, capital market, health, politics, governance and technology etc.  In terms of percentage of inclusion in line with the 35% affirmative action and even in terms of total number of cabinet make up, Kano State is not the most women inclusive state in governance as claimed by the state government. Deploying this as the major yardstick, we conclude that the claim is false.  ",FALSE-,21/09/2021,https://dubawa.org/does-kano-have-the-highest-women-inclusion-in-governance-as-ganduje-claims/

A click through the Wikipedia profile of the result displayed shows that the same website www.uneca.org was displayed as the official website of the commission.  After this initial check, this fact-checker then returned to the google search engine result and clicked on the news header but no result displayed any association with UNECA offering a $25,000 Grant to Africans with innovative ideas.  An integrity test was conducted on both the www.uneca.org which is the website that tops search engine results when checked and the www.unafrica.org which is the website that claims to be taking applications for the said grant, to check authenticity.

Fraudsters send fake emails or set up fake websites that mimic an original one to trick users into disclosing sensitive information. This practice is sometimes referred to as “phishing” — a play on the word “fishing.”  Typically, fraudsters try to trick users into providing their sensitive information such as usernames and passwords so that they can gain access to an online account. Once they gain access, they can use this personal information to commit identity theft, charge credit cards, empty bank accounts, read user emails among other abuses.  Further checks on the commission’s Facebook page shows the same www.uneca.org as its official website, and its Twitter handle and LinkedIn profile, did not have any information related to a $25,000 Grant.

Claim: A viral Facebook message has been crediting ousted Guinea President Alpha Conde for some infrastructural development in Guinea with photos of an expressway and a couple of buildings captioning it “See what Alpha Conde Did for Guinea.”,"Following the September 12, 2021 coup d’etat that ousted Guinean President, Professor Alpha Conde from power, social media have been awash with several messages relating to the coup. Whilst a number of the photos captured and shared online  have been related to the coup that was led by leader of the Special Force Lieutenant Colonel Mamadi Dumbuya,  some of images are completely detached and unrelated to the events unfolding in the Francophone West African nation. A photo of an expressway and several luxurious projects have been circulating with the caption “See what Alpha Conde has done for Guinea.” The photos have been  published by a Facebook page, SL Blog, with the caption “I will never leave Guinea in the hands of the bandits. Says Alpha Conde. See below what Professor Alpha Conde did for Guinea” and has so far seen over 417 likes and shared 40 times. Professor Alphas Conde ascended the seat of power when he won the 2010 general elections in Guinea and had served for over a decade winning two terms before setting up a referendum to have the constitution favor his third term bid. The referendum which was mired in controversies was overwhelmingly in his favour and made him eligible to contest for a third term which he did and won amid protests and violent clashes.  A Google reverse image search shows the expressway has no connection to Alpha Conde and Guinea. It is an Algerian road project which  Algerian Minister of Public Works in 2014, Mr. Abdelkader Kadi, launched to the east-west motorway and the port of Mostaganem. “This 66-kilometer long road, which will link the east-west highway at the Hmadna interchange, will cross the localities of Hmadna, El Hamri, Khelaifia and Sidi Khettab to the east of the wilaya of Relizane and Oued El Kheir , Ouled El Bachir and Kheireddine in the wilaya of Mostaganem,” said the Minister of Public Work Mr. Abdelkader Kadi in 2014. A second image of a power plant also accredited to Professor Alpha Conde in the viral Facebook post is equally misleading as the dam attached is not a Guinean property. Using Google reverse image search, we identified the dam as the INGA hydro plant connected to the Inga Fall in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Whilst some of the images like the Grand Mosque and the Hotels are Guinean infrastructures, not all can be credited to Alpha Conde.  The Grand Mosque “Grande Mosquée Fayçal” which is the fourth biggest Mosque in the World and is located in Conakry was built in 1982 under Ahmed Sekou Turay while the Riviera Hotel was established in 2001, nine years before Conde took power.  The image below, identified as the  Hotel Palm Camayenne is equally a Guinean project. This hotel was built by Russians in 1964 and went through different phases of refurbishment and management. It remained a state property until 2011 when it was reported that it had been bought by a Lebanese businessman, Michel Charter. This image below is actually a Guinean infrastructure and it is the Sheraton Grand Conakry Hotel that was launched sometime in 2016. The Sheraton Grand Conakry Hotel marks Marriott International’s entry into Guinea and joins a portfolio of more than 35 Sheraton Grand properties worldwide, with destinations spanning Istanbul, Dubai, Bangalore, Beijing and beyond. This is therefore a private business venture and directly attributing it to Alpha Conde’s successes is misleading. This next image is the Grand Diamond  Plaza located in Kipe in Conakry  and was actually commissioned by ousted President Alpha Condeh as sitting president and the CEO of CDG Yao Tianping  in 2015. This was a China Dreal Group (CDG) real estate investment and it is popularly known as the International City of Conakry.   Plaza Diamond Kipe Whilst most of these infrastructures are found in Guinea, it is clear from the analysis that they are private projects and investments-mostly hotels. Some of them were as well not done during the presidency of Conde and therefore not part of what President Alpha Conde has done for Guinea as captioned by the facebook post. The images of infrastructural gains accredited to President Alpha Conde in the screenshots above are misleading. Good job. We need factual news.

Claim: A WhatsApp message claims  that Globacom Limited (GLO) is giving out 20GB of data valid for 30 days without any recharge  to all its customers in celebration of its 18th anniversary.,"A random WhatsApp  message purported to be from Globacom Limited (GLO), a Nigerian multinational telecommunication company, offering its customers 20GB of data valid for 30 days   in celebration of its 18th anniversary has been widely shared by users since 3rd of August..   The claim, which requires sharing to many  groups as means of getting the 20GB data, has been  circulating on WhatsApp  as many strive to get their share of the offer.  In verifying this claim, our fact-checker contacted GLO through its official Facebook account and it urged that the information be disregarded as it is not from them.  Furthermore, we found that the original Uniform Resource Locator  (URL) of GLO  is www.glo.com and not  https:bit.ly/MTN-FREE-10GB-DATA as indicated by the claim. GLO had indeed announced a reward of data and airtime packages to its subscribers in Nigeria in August to mark its 18th anniversary. Eligible customers must have recharged with a cumulative of N200 or above from July to August 16 and they would have received the offer as a message on their mobile phones without going through any process. Liberia was not mentioned in the announcement. Our fact-checker went further to verify the link attached to the message. When she clicked on the link,  it opened with the GLO logo at the top and a message instructing the next step of the procedure with many comments of people believed to be participants of the process lauding the company for giving them the 20GB data. The next step requested  participants to enter a mobile number and select the network provider. She entered a generated Lonestar number and selected MTN  as the provider and clicked the send option. After a few minutes of loading, a congratulatory message popped up on the screen stating that the number was eligible for the offer. It instructed that the message be shared with 12  different WhatsApp groups in order to get to the final stage in getting the 20GB claimed. It also stated that when the task is fully completed, the participant will receive the offer within five minutes on her mobile phone.  .  Screenshot of the message below After sharing to several groups, the chance of getting to the next stage grew slowly and requested a restart of the process. After some minutes of continued efforts to get to the next stage, she experienced some difficulty in logging into her Facebook account that led to non-access for some hours. She later got a warning from Facebook that she tried sharing intimate content that is against its regulations. It warned that if it is repeated her account will be blocked.  Further verification through DomainBigData, an online investigative tool,  shows that the website has been reported several times for  abuse .

Claim: A post that has been forwarded many times on WhatsApp claims a houseplant is toxic and has killed a child.,"Individuals are encouraged to decorate their homes and environments with flowers for beauty, some health benefits and to protect the planet. But not all flowers can be planted at home or used in decorating the house. Some are toxic and dangerous and should not be kept in the home, especially in homes with young children and pets. A social media image that has been forwarded many times on WhatsApp in Nigeria in September 2021 mentions that an individual’s son “died because he put a piece of the leaf in his mouth.” The writer notes that the plant, though common in many homes and offices, is “poisonous and dangerous” and that it can “kill a child in 1 minute and an adult in 15 minutes.” The message discourages people from touching their eyes after touching the plant as it could lead to permanent blindness.” Dubawa sent the image to two academics in the Botany Department of the University of Lagos, Nigeria (to confirm the name of the plant) and they both replied that it is called Dieffenbachia or Dumb Cane. Dubawa did an image search using Google Reverse Image Search and TinEye. The results showed the specific image used in the post (without the accompanying text) and without providing any link to the initial post. A first analysis of the image appears doctored as it does not appear to be from either Facebook, Instagram or Twitter. The outlook of the image is not that of Facebook, while Twitter and Instagram do not have ‘share’ options. Twitter does not also have the ‘comment’ option. The origin of the image is not stated and also appears doctored. All the same, Dubawa searched on Facebook and found a similar image but the image appears uploaded and shared to Facebook rather than an image with text created on it. A video with the same narrative was also shared on Facebook four years ago but it has only been viewed 159 times. Another long post with an attached video (on Facebook) has the wordings of the viral image as part of its long content. The image of the Dieffenbachia plant in the video is not the one in the viral image. The video was posted in 2017 with a comment, four shares and 48 likes. An Associate Professor of Botany at the University of Lagos, Dr. Akeem Babalola Kadiri, told Dubawa that Dieffenbachia can make people who touch it and then touch themselves to itch and that it can also be poisonous. Dr Temitope Onuminya, a Senior Lecturer, also in the Botany Department of the University of Lagos said Dieffenbachia “produces some toxic chemicals which might be injurious to health.” Dr Onuminya also said Dieffenbachia may be kept at home but it has to be done “with caution, especially where there are children who like to mouth everything around them.” Dr Onuminya told Dubawa that Dieffenbachia “produces sap (milky juice) on the leaf surface and the cells contain needle-shaped calcium oxalate crystals called raphides. So, if a leaf is chewed, these crystals can cause a temporary burning sensation, intense numbing, oral irritation, excessive drooling, and localised swelling.” According to Trees.com, Dieffenbachia is called ‘Dumb Cane’ because, when chewed, it causes discomforts which “include difficulty swallowing and oral irritation, and these effects on the throat and mouth can render people speechless, or ‘struck dumb,’ hence the name Dumb Cane.” Dr Onuminya told Dubawa that the majority of the discomforts caused by Dieffenbachia can be treated with “analgesic agents, antihistamines or medical charcoal. Patients who end up being hospitalised are those who ingest a high volume of the leaves, leading to severe swelling of the throat.”  Dr Onuminya, however, stated that she does not have information that Dieffenbachia can cause death or blindness. However, she recommended that individuals exposed to the plant should seek medical attention. Information that the toxic level of Dieffenbachia is in the range of mild to moderate can also be found on websites like Trees.com and Dengarden.com In a 2021 study published in Prestige Journal of Education, on the need to counsel households in Calabar about the dangers of Dieffenbachia, Effiom, Ubi and Ekwok argue that the sap of Dieffenbachia can cause permanent damage if they come in contact with the eyes. Although it is important to note that Effiom’s field is not stated, Ubi is in the Department of Genetics and Biotechnology while Ekwok is a Guidance Counsellor. Dieffenbachia (or Dumb Cane) should be kept in living areas with caution, especially if there are children and/or pets present. While the plant can be toxic or harmful, the assertion that it can cause death or permanent blindness has not been proven.

Infections can begin anywhere in the body and may spread all through it. An infection can cause fever and other health problems, depending on where it occurs in the body.” How true is this claim? Dubawa conducted some research to know if there are possible  effects of not urinating when the urge to do so started.  In some cases, holding in urine for too long can cause bacteria to multiply. This may lead to a urinary tract infection (UTI)”. No research has shown that holding in urine for a long time causes UTIs, but  doctors advise that it should be avoided,  especially if a person has a history of frequent UTIs. People who do not drink enough liquids may be more likely to develop a UTI because the bladder is not telling the body to urinate often enough. This can cause bacteria to spread through the urinary tract, leading to infection. Holding in urine may cause kidney stones to form in people with a history of the condition, or people who have a high mineral content in their urine. Pee often contains minerals such as uric acid and calcium oxalate.  Dr Jemimah Abner of Surgery Department in State Specialist Hospital Gombe said urine left in the bladder for a very long time can cause UTI as well as affect the kidney. “Studies show that the human urine in the bladder is sterile but may be colonized by small numbers of microorganisms. While the urethra is colonized with a large number of microorganisms.  “UTI often occurs via the ascending route, where the micro-organisms from the urethra ascend into the bladder and would eventually affect the kidneys. The risk of coming down with UTI is high in females due to the anatomy of the urethra; the urethra is shorter than that of males and its proximity to the vaginal and the perianal areas. Abner added that retaining urine for long in the bladder can give room for these microorganisms to find their way into the bladder. But when one ensures he or she empties the bladder as frequently as possible, it helps eliminate some of these microorganisms from their hiding places. “It’s important to pass urine frequently and avoid the habit of holding urine for a long time even when pressed. It would not only stop at causing UTI but might eventually affect the kidneys,” she said.  Mrs Elizabeth Adekoya, a health personnel  working with Doma Clinic in Gombe said leaving urine to stay for too long is harmful to the body.  She added, ” it is bad to leave urine in the bladder especially for those having a history of infections as urine gives birth to bacteria.  Urine left in the bladder can cause bacteria in the human body, thereby causing infection.   ",TRUE,17/09/2021,https://dubawa.org/true-urine-left-in-bladder-may-cause-infections/
Claim: A viral WhatsApp image accompanied by a text claims a daughter married her own mother,"Of the 195 independent countries of the world recognised by the United Nations, only about 30 have legalised gay marriages. But when a gay couple is now related – as in a daughter marrying her mother, that relationship will definitely raise eyebrows, because it is regarded as incest. Incest occurs when there is a marriage or sexual relationship between two individuals who are regarded as too closely related to get physically involved with each other. While gay marriages are contentious and have generated different opinions across regions and cultures, there seems to be an almost unanimous consensus against incest, especially between a parent and their child. A WhatsApp image with an attached text that has been forwarded many times in August 2021 in Nigeria claims a 26-year-old lady married her 44-year-old mother. The message didn’t provide details about the nationalities of the women and the date or location of the wedding. It simply said that the daughter (Lolita) married her mother (Loreta) because her mum was the only one that cared for her. Dubawa read the exchange among the members of one of the WhatsApp groups in which the image was shared. While some believed and condemned the assumed act, others imagined it must be a mother walking her daughter down the aisle in the absence of a father while others noted that the image could have been manipulated. The information about the alleged marriage between this daughter and her mother has been shared on several platforms across Africa between 2020 and 2021. In 2021, it was published on Sleek Gist, Scooper News, The World News,  Best Show Biz, Opera News Ghana, NgGossips, News.paperlez.com and Face of Malawi, while the following media published the story in 2020; National Daily Newspaper, Olumuyiwa.com.ng and Lusaka Gazette. A Ghanaian YouTuber, SISTA AKOS with 21,900 subscribers also made a video about the alleged marriage on September 26,  2020, and the video has been watched over 8,500 times as at the time of this writing. While the information had been in the public domain for a while, the rate at which it is now being shared (in 2021) on social media and by some online news media has necessitated a fact-check. The shared image had the tag ‘fb: FAYA Magazine’. So Dubawa searched Facebook and saw the post on the Facebook page of FAYA Magazine, an Abidjan-based Côte d’Ivoire Magazine. It was posted on September 3, 2020 and has been viewed over 5,200 times. It has generated over 10,000 comments and has been shared 9,300 times.  The message attached to the WhatsApp message is the same used by all the cited media; that both Lolita and her mother, Loreta, loved themselves and the mother consented to the marriage because the daughter threatened to leave the house if she didn’t comply. The Facebook message did not provide any details about the location of the women and/or where they are from. A Google reverse image search showed that the image with the same attached text was published on the Facebook page of CeleSylv Updates, except that this time, it was stated that the mother and daughter were South Africans. The message has been flagged as ‘False Information’ by Facebook due to a fact-check by Africa Check. A TinEye Reverse Image search showed the image was first uploaded on a Moroccan website in 2018 although a similar search by Africa Check yielded a 2014 date. Dubawa also confirmed that the image was posted by “the UK-based website Gay Wedding Venues under the header “Gay Wedding Inspiration” as noted by Africa Check. There was no text about the couple, except a caption telling prospective clients that their wedding is what ‘they make of it.” Although Africa Check says the Zambian Observer is the first medium to weave a story around the image, the first story stated by Africa Check could not be found on the website again while the second story that was published on October 7, 2020, was accompanied by the exact texts used in the other media (who had published the false information) but with a different image of a lesbian couple. There is no sufficient evidence that the couple in the image is a daughter marrying her mother. Africa Check has also fact-checked the story and gave it a false verdict.

"Claim: A link shared many times on many WhatsApp groups claims that as part of its 40th anniversary, FoodCo Nigeria is offering cash rewards up to 30,000 to its customers.","A link, which surfaced recently,  has a claim that FoodCo Nigeria, a consumer goods retail chain, is giving people up to 30,000 in cash purportedly to celebrate its 40th anniversary.  The link has been shared multiple times on WhatsApp, asking members of the public to visit the website to fill out a survey and share to at least five (WhatsApp) groups and 20 friends as a condition to receiving the thirty thousand naira cash.  This researcher visited the website of the company, FoodCo to ascertain the veracity of the promotion. The twitter account FoodCo Nigeria showed no indication or information regarding any offer of cash to customers or members of the public.  A check on the company’s Facebook Page did not yield any post to that effect. In fact, on Thursday, 9 September 2021, the company put out a caveat about the promotion, stating that it is fake. An Inquiry sent to WhatsApp number +2349065050081 as seen on FoodCo Nigeria website also elicited a related message. It stated that the link and its content should be ignored.  This researcher reached out to the company through an email address [email protected] available  on its website.  A repondent named Adenike replied to an enquiry sent to the mail address [email protected] The message reads in part:  “Our attention has been drawn to the website purportedly offering cash  rewards for FoodCo’s 40th Anniversary, please disregard as it is a scam.  Please be informed that FoodCo Nigeria Limited is not organizing such  promo at this time.

"Claim: The Governor of Kebbi State, Atiku Badugu, said some countries have ranches that are bigger than some states in Nigeria.","The farmers-herders crisis in Nigeria is an issue of growing concern among stakeholders across the country. These lingering clashes, which have claimed several lives and displaced others, have made the government start thinking of initiatives to address the situation.  In a 2018 report by Reliefweb, violence between Nigerian herders and farmers has escalated, killing more than 1,300 people since January of the same year. The figures are believed to have increased since then as the media is now awash with daily reports of deaths arising from such clashes.  For Benue State alone, it is estimated that over 2,000 people have been killed and over 1.5 million people are in Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) camps in the state, following the sustained clashes between farmers and herders between 2017 and 2021. The farmer-herder conflict is said to have contributed largely to the displacement of millions of Nigerians in the central, north-central, and northwest regions of the country. A recent report by the Internal Displacement Monitoring Center says IDPs across the country is 2,730,000 though not all are attributed to the herders-farmers crisis. It is also said to have sharpened ethnic, regional and religious polarisation. In a bid to curb this menace, President Muhammadu Buhari had recently ordered a committee to review 368 grazing sites across 25 states in the country to determine the levels of encroachment but this was met with stiff resistance in some parts of the country. While explaining the situation, the Governor of Kebbi State, Atiku Badugu, said some countries of the world have ranches that are bigger than some states in Nigeria. He made the statement when he appeared as a guest on Channels Television.  Bagudu, who was speaking on the persistent issues of farmer-herders clash in Nigeria, said mapping out grazing routes will help to identify the scale of the crisis. He said the president’s directive does not preclude the idea of ranching. He was quoted as saying, “The committee is to identify grazing routes and work with states and map them. It is not to recover grazing routes, it is to identify the scale of the problem.” “Mr President is interested in an audit of grazing reserves. It is a voluntary and collaborative thing with the states. People say we have spoken about ranching. Yes, but what is a ranch? Ranching does not take place in the air, it takes place on a piece of land. “Ranches are as big as grazing reserves. In some countries like Australia, some ranches are bigger than some Nigerian states. “So how do you know what’s available, what can be supported to host those roving, herding communities who need help to modernise?” Dubawa ran a check on the landmass of Nigeria as a whole. According to the World Bank collection of development indicators, land area (sq. km) in Nigeria was reported at 910770 sq. Km in 2018. Meanwhile, the Nigeria High Commission, UK specified that the Area Total was 923,770 km2 while the Area Land was 910,770 with a coastline of 853 km.  The country is divided into 36 States of the federation with the least (in terms of landmass) being Lagos at 3,671km² followed by Anambra at 4,865 km²; Abia State has a landmass of 4,900 km²; Imo State spans across 5,288 km².  Other states’ landmass is as follows: Ekiti: 5,435km²; Ebonyi: 6,400km²; Akwa Ibom: 6,900km² while 12 other states of the federation are within 7, 534km² and 23, 561km².  The report quoted the Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NIMET).   Screenshot of the area of the Nigerian states Dubawa researched further and discovered that one of the cattle ranches (station) in Australia, referred to as the world’s biggest cattle ranch, Anna Creek Station, covers 23,677 square kilometres (9,142 square miles) of arid central Australia.  From further research, it was discovered that Clifton Hills is considered to be the world’s second-largest farming property with more than 16,500 square kilometres. Australia has been said to be the world’s third-largest exporter of beef – selling more than 1.5 million tonnes a year of red meat – according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The country is recognised as a leading long-haul exporter of live cattle globally, with trade links to supply chains in South-East Asia and the  Middle East, although a report said Australia produces only 4% of global beef.  There are ranches in some countries of the world that are larger than some states in Nigeria as claimed by Bagudu.

"Claim: A Gynecologist, Dr. Jen Gunther, warned that waxing or shaving of a woman’s pubic hair can cause ‘microscopic trauma’ and lead to infections.","An online medium Trojan News posted an article of a gynecologist, Dr. Jen Gunther, urging women not to remove their pubic hair. In the article, the gynecologist and author of The Vagina Bible  was quoted as saying “waxing or shaving creates microscopic trauma that can lead to infections.” “Getting a Brazilian may also reduce pleasure, with the pubic hair being connected to nerve endings that might help arousal,” Dr. Gunter added. Pubic hair is basically body hair that is found and located in the genital area of human beings. The hair is present on and around the sexual organs. It is found in the scrotum (male) and vulva (female). Over the years, having a bare and smooth skin has become a common practice for people all over the world regardless of their gender. This practice, just as in some climes, has become a norm to have the public hair removed and is often regarded as part of personal hygiene. And as such, it has become a routine for some women to shave or wax their hair especially around the private part. Though the removal of pubic hair is generally safe, there are some common side effects. These include: -Itching -Cuts -Rashes -Infections -Burns from chemical removers So, those waxing and shaving of a woman’s pubic hair cause microscopic trauma leading to infections. Microscopic trauma which is also known as microtrauma is basically any small injury that is usually one of a series that can lead to major injuries. It can include the micro-tearing of muscle fibers, the sheath around the muscle, and the connective tissue. Microscopic injuries are overuse injuries from persistent and repetitive motions that can cause microscopic damage, muscle and connective tissue imbalances that can over time alter and limit activities. The area of injury undergoes a mechanical stress reaction that may sometimes include microtears, inflammation, swelling, and tenderness, usually in a pointed area. Early microtrauma may not be detectable, obvious, painful, or have any swelling. However, as the overuse continues with time, the microscopic imbalance becomes extreme, and extra tear weakens the flesh while tissue degeneration increases until symptoms or physical limitations manifest. Can waxing and shaving of the pubic hair cause microscopic trauma leading to infections and reducing arousal for a woman? A Consultant Gynecologist with the University of Medical sciences teaching hospital, Ondo (UNIMEDTH), Dr. Olukayode Lawal, said microscopic trauma occurs when the pubic hair is removed often. According to him, ‘For every cycle of shaving, in the course of the regrowth of hair, there is a tendency that the rate at which the various hair growth occurs could be a point or site for infection. Depending on the method used to get rid of the pubic hair, one could either suffer a cut or injury, so as much as one sweats or inserts a foreign object in that area, it could lead to a risk of infection. If one has unprotected sex, it could be a source of sexually transmitted infection.’ While reacting to the claim that waxing could reduce pleasure, Dr. Lawal said every structure in that perennial region is well vascularized and so could be easily stimulated and as such a cut in that region could lead to pain during sex, thus increasing the possibility of contacting sexual infection. Dr Lawal, however, advised that women should limit the removal of their pubic hair and only do so when it is well grown. A Gynecologist, Dr. Victor Adefesoye, said there is an average possibility of waxing and shaving of the pubic hair causing microscopic trauma which could lead to infections. “There is a 50-50 chance of this happening and that is because if one has a cut in the pubic area and such is not well taken care of, it could lead to infections. However, it is not true in cases, where the removal of pubic hair does not leave an injury behind. So, if there is an injury, it could lead to infection sometimes, only if not well taken care of.” While also speaking on the possibility of pubic hair removal reducing pleasure, Dr. Adefesoye said there would be reduced arousal if the woman suffers an injury in the course of shaving or waxing the public area. “If there is a cut in the public region and she is engaged in a sexual activity, the cut could be painful to the woman and that could reduce the woman’s libido thereby leading to reduced pleasure,” he said. He, therefore, opined that cuts or injuries suffered during the removal of pubic hair could reduce sexual pleasure. Studies have also shown that grooming one’s pubic hair can be harmful to one’s health as one-quarter of people who shave or wax are injuring themselves. The biggest risk in getting nicked while removing pubic hair is that small cuts can let in bacteria. Researchers also found a link between more frequent grooming and sexually transmitted diseases, such as herpes or syphilis. Frequently shaving or waxing one’s pubic hair could lead to cuts which in turn aid infection when not properly treated and this can also dampen a woman’s arousal during sexual intercourse.

A call for massive recruitment at the Sokoto State University has recently been going round on social media especially the WhatsApp platform, with a directive to share widely for qualified Nigerians to take advantage of the job openings.  The message stated that the university wishes to engage suitably qualified scholars and academics to fill numerous academic and non-academic positions, which includes: Senior Lecturer, Professor, Graduate Assistant, Lecturer 1, Lecturer II Reader, Counseling Psychologist, Higher Pharmacy Technician, Medical Officer, Graduate Nursing Officer, Principal Library Officer amongst others, with October 18, 2021 deadline.  Screenshot of the WhatsApp message about Sokoto State University  Sokoto State is one of the 36 States of Nigeria, located in the extreme northwest of the country on the national border with the Republic of Niger. Arising from the insatiable quest of the people of the state for education and excellence, the idea of establishing the Sokoto State University was conceived by the then Sokoto State Governor Aliyu Wamakko when he established the Sokoto State University Implementation Committee in 2008.  The committee was charged with the responsibility of: Planning for the structure and facilities for the effective running of the university, seeking for and obtaining approval from the Federal Government for Sokoto state to run its own university aside, Usmanu Danfodiyo University, which is Federal Government owned and in which the indigenes of the state were marginally placed over the years arising from the Federal Character Principle; and establishing the Sokoto State University School of Developmental Studies with the sole aim of preparing students, a one-year pre-degree programme before enrolling into the University. The approval was granted in 2009.  Dubawa began its verification by visiting the website attached to the viral message.  Screenshot of the call for application on the website  The site contains numerous calls for recruitments for academic and non- academic positions in different universities in Nigeria including that of the Sokoto State University.

Talking about the advertised job, the site states that the salaries and conditions of service are as applicable to the post appointed for in Nigerian Universities as approved by Sokoto State Government and the Governing Council of the university from time to time.  It also urged interested and qualified candidates to submit their applications and up-to-date curriculum vitae to include contact mobile phone numbers and email addresses through the university’s email: [email protected] or by Courier to: The Registrar, Sokoto State University, P.M. 2134, Birnin Kebbi Road, Sokoto, Sokoto State.  screenshot of application instruction  The website added a caveat that said it is not an agent of any organizations, and cannot assist any applicant to secure a job, loan, grant, or scholarship, as they only share the information for interested persons to apply.  Further search on the website of Sokoto State University revealed there was no opening for job offers but it contains a disclaimer dated August 18, 2021 and signed by the institution’s Registrar, Amins Yusuf Garba, to a false advertisement being circulated online, soliciting applications for a purported recruitment exercise.  The university in the disclaimer notified the general public that the university is not recruiting for any position, either directly or through any proxy, as it warned the general public to be cautious and vigilant to avoid falling victim to the plots of  unscrupulous elements who are circulating the false recruitment notices, to deceive unsuspecting applicants.  “In view of the above, the university is hereby advising the general public to always seek accurate and credible information by visiting its website @ www.ssu.edu.ng, its verified social media handles on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn and YouTube or by visiting the Institution,” the disclaimer added.

"Claim: A viral TikTok video, forwarded many times on WhatsApp in Nigeria, claims corn silk cures several diseases.","There is a paradigm shift from Evidence Based Medicine (EBM), (which involves the use of only evidence based methods and medications in treating patients) to a nutrition based approach in which many experts and private individuals promote general wellness and disease prevention/treatment using food and other locally available herbs and spices. While nutrition plays a significant role in health and wellbeing, there is insufficient evidence that food can be used to cure serious diseases like cancer and other major illnesses once they occur. A viral video that has been forwarded many times on WhatsApp in Nigeria claims that corn silk cures many diseases. The 35 seconds video shows a woman demonstrating how to prepare corn silk for treatment. She asks viewers to “boil some water, put in the corn silk, turn off the stove and let it simmer for 30 minutes and drink the water”. She went on to say that the mixture is very good for curing “bladder infection, kidney stones, heart failure, inflammation of the prostate, urinary system, and diabetes.” She ended by noting that “simple things in life will give healing, it’s all about life changes” and encourages everyone to “try it.”  Screenshot of the viral video on WhatsApp Dubawa searched TikTok and found the video on Sharon’s page. She uses @eden.health and has 548,000 followers and 2 million likes. Her philosophy is “Let Food Be Your Medicine and Medicine be your Food.”   Dubawa searched her page and discovered that the corn silk video was recorded in two parts; the second part has been watched over 515,000 times, gained over 24,000 likes and shared 2,550 times. The only new information in the “CornSilk: Part 2” video is her recommendation that viewers drink 1 to 2 cups in a day at room temperature.  Screenshot of the Part 2 of the corn silk video on TikTok Many of Sharon’s followers confirmed that they remembered their Asian grandparents taking corn silk tea, some were eager to try out the ‘health’ recipe while others were curious about its efficacy. Corn silks are the “long shiny and silky fibers that grow inside the husks of ears of corn.” They are the “yellowish thread-like strands from the female flower of the corn/maize plant.” Corn silk has been used as medicinal herbs in Asia for a long time. In a 2012 study published in Molecules, Hasanudin, Hashim and Mustafa assert that corn silk can serve as antioxidant, anti-depressant, anti-fatigue, a diuretic agent and can help reduce hyperglycemia – thereby confirming the claims made by Sharon in her TikTok video.

"Claim: A viral video shows a herd of cattle being washed away by flood in Argungu, Kebbi State of Nigeria.","A viral video has been making rounds in social media especially WhatsApp. The 30 seconds video shows a strong current of water in a field and a herd of cattle appears to be dragged by the current. Accompanying text in the video suggests the incident took place in Argungu, Kebbi State. The said video was also posted on Facebook by Denis Nwosu with the caption: ‘ Flood carries a herd of Cows away in Argungun, Kebbi State. Kebbi is the state where the great and historical Argungun fishing festivals take place. But, what is not clear is this; Why has this flood or river carried all these cows away.  Did they just walk into it or what, and where is the herdsman?’ This video is now making rounds in the social media on the heels of heavy rainfalls in different parts of the country. This is just as the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency predicted that some states will be affected by floods. The 2021 Annual Flood Outlook (AFO) which is published by the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA) predicts that parts of 121 local government areas LGAs in 27 states and the FCT will fall within the highly probable flood risk areas, while parts of 302 LGAs in all the 36 states of the federation including FCT fall within the moderately probable flood risk areas. The parts of the remaining 351 council areas fall within the low probable flood areas. According to the AFO, the 27 highly probable flood risk states are: Abia, Akwa-Ibom, Anambra, Bauchi, Bayelsa, Benue, Cross-River, Delta, Ebonyi, Edo, Gombe, Imo, Jigawa, Kaduna, Kano, Kebbi, Kogi, Kwara, Lagos, Nasarawa, Niger, Ogun, Oyo, Rivers, Sokoto, Taraba and Zamfara. The agency said flash and urban floods are expected to occur in major cities and other locations in Birnin Kebbi, Sokoto, Kaduna, Yola, Gombe, Abuja, Makurdi, Lafia, Asaba, Yenagoa, Port Harcourt, Abeokuta, Lagos, Ibadan, Benin-City, Ado-Ekiti, Abakaliki, Oshogbo, Nsukka, Awka, Owerri, Kano and Calabar owing to poor drainage systems. Meanwhile, report has it that many Nigerians, especially those in states prone to flooding, are living in fear following the prediction by the NIHSA, which they say has painted a scary picture of likely havoc throughout this year’s rainy season.  This point is buttressed by a viral video making rounds on WhatsApp, where a herd of cattle is being washed afloat by flood in Argunga, Kebbi State. For most viewers, the cattle must have been feeding by the roadside or in the area before being washed away. In Nigeria, during the rainy season, herdsmen move about for greener pasture and fresh water for their cows. Although some farmers take fodder to their animals in sheds, others allow them to roam about freely. Nigeria is however a crossroads for cattle from other countries to include Cameroon, Niger, Burkina Faso and Chad. Herders pass through the country in search of better climate, pasture and more water. The increase in cattle and human population has led to cities growing larger and wider and, in some cases, affecting formally designated cattle routes and reserves, thereby pushing herders into contested territories. And this has led to the clamour of most states to sign the anti-grazing bill in some states of the federation. So, did a herd of cattle get washed away by flood in Kebbi State? A Yandex reverse image search shows that the video supposedly showing a herd of cattle being washed away in Argungu, Kebbi State is actually from Mexico that was hit by tropical storm Hanna on July 26, 2020. Further verification shows different articles which reported the incident after it occurred. One of the reports reveals that the Zacualpan River in the state of Nayarit overflowed and carried the cattle while leaving damages to homes located on its banks. Findings also showed a Youtube video of the same incident captioned ‘River drag Cattle. Everything is rescued in Zacualpan Nayarit 27/07/2020’ when translated to English. The claim that a herd of cattle was washed away by flood in Kebbi State of Nigeria is false as the flood happened in Mexico in 2020.

"Claim: “82.2% of the Liberian population opted for transitional justice or the Palaver Hut discussion to settle issues surrounding our civil war” – Syrenius Cephus, Solicitor General","Claim: “82.2% of the Liberian population opted for transitional justice or the Palaver Hut discussion to settle issues surrounding our civil war” – Syrenius Cephus, Solicitor General There is no evidence that 82.2% per cent of the Liberian population opted for Transitional justice or the Palaver hut discussion to settle issues surrounding our civil war. When Solicitor General (SG) Cephus appeared on OK FM, on August 2, 2021, he claimed that  “82.2 per cent of the Liberian population opted for transitional justice or the palaver hut discussion to settle issues surrounding our civil war.” Cllr Cephus in an interview said his source was the TRC report. “You have to read the report, it is stated there, my reliance is the TRC,” he said. In Liberia, there have been calls from both local and international countries for the establishment of a war crimes court to bring justice to those bearing higher responsibility for Liberia’s more than a decade-long bloody civil war. But the SG says 82.2% of Liberians agreed to transitional justice instead of a war crimes court. Councilor Cephus also claimed that in the absence of what he calls total stability, the government would not opt for the establishment of such a tribunal. Liberia went through civil crises which resulted in the destruction of lives and properties, including the loss of approximately 250,000 lives and the displacement of thousands of Liberians, when a crisis engulfed the country in 1989. This researcher perused the Truth Reconciliation Commission (TRC) report which the SG said he relied on and found that although there were palava huts on transitional justice forums, there was no mention of the percentage of Liberians who opted for it. Fubbi Henries, a War Crimes Court activist, also says there has been no survey conducted in Liberia to ascertain the total number of people who preferred transitional justice. “The claim is a lie,” he said in reaction to the claim. At the same time, Tennen Dalieh, a doctoral student at Dublin City University researching universal jurisdiction, transitional justice, peacebuilding and reconciliation in Liberia, said in an interview that there is no record of 82 per cent of Liberians consenting to transitional justice. “There is absolutely no record that 82 per cent agreed to transitional justice,” Dalieh said. The Senate endorsed the recommendation of its leadership committee to set up a Transitional Justice Commission (TJC). The plenary action of TJC came as a response to the request of President George Weah for advice on how his administration should proceed in handling the recommendations of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC). The unanimous decision was taken by the senate after expert opinions and inputs were solicited from the Solicitor General of Liberia, Saymah Syrenius Cephus, the Liberian National Bar Association and other interested parties. The TJC is to analyze the TRC report and give further recommendations to the President. There is no evidence that 82.2% of the Liberian population opted for transitional justice or the palaver hut discussion to settle issues surrounding Liberia’s civil war. According to the TRC report, though there were town hall meetings, there is no record that 82% of Liberians opted for transitional justice.

Claim: A Facebook user claims water gotten from snails (snail slime) and peak milk can cure partial or full stroke.,"On July 26, 2020, a Facebook user, Prince Nnamdi Enyinnaya Emelelu Eluwa, in a post claimed that water gotten from snails (Snail slime) and peak milk can cure partial or full stroke. The post which is over a year old has recently been reshared by other Facebook users. This post has attracted over 72,000 shares, more than 11,000 likes and over 13,000 comments. According to the post, taking three spoons of the mixture in the morning, afternoon and night for one week will help cure stroke. It reads: “Get snails, those big snails, wash them very well with clean water, then break the snail gently and don’t waste the water that come out from the snails while breaking them. Gather the water from the snails together in a ragolis container and do this. This is how to collect water from snails. “Soak the snails in water to get them drawned, then pick each snail and break the pointed end of the snail and was will be coming out of it, the water is not slining one but brownish in colour. After gathering the water together in a ragolis container, get a tin peak milk, open it then pour all the peak milk inside Ragolis container where you have the water from the snail and do this afterwards. “After you have mixed both the snail water and the Tin peak milk together inside the ragolis container, shake it very well and follow the prescription below, this prescription should be followed accordingly for a better result. “PRESCRIPTION: Three teaspoon in the morning. Three teaspoon in the afternoon. Three teaspoon in the Night.” Dubawa conducted multiple searches that show that this claim has been posted by several websites. According to the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),  stroke occurs when the blood flow that carries oxygen and nutrients to an area of the brain is blocked or when a blood vessel in the brain bursts. The health agency explained that the brain needs oxygen to work properly and if the flow of blood is blocked, the brain cells start to die because they can’t get oxygen. A stroke can cause lasting brain damage, long-term disability, or even death. The CDC reported that in the United States in 2018, one in every six deaths from cardiovascular disease was due to stroke, someone in the United States has a stroke every 40 seconds, every four minutes, someone dies of stroke. The agency also reported that every year, more than 795,000 people in the United States have a stroke and about 610,000 of these are first or new strokes, about 185,000 strokes—nearly 1 of 4—are in people who have had a previous stroke, about 87 per cent of all strokes are ischemic strokes, in which blood flow to the brain is blocked. The three types of stroke are; ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke and transient ischemic attack, also known as a mini-stroke. Ischemic stroke is the most common type of stroke, about 87 percent of people suffering from stroke have Ischemic stroke. It occurs when blood flow through the artery that supplies oxygen-rich blood to the brain becomes blocked. A hemorrhagic stroke happens when a blood vessel breaks and bleeds into the brain. It is mostly caused by uncontrolled high blood pressure.  The transient ischemic attack, which is also known as a mini-stroke, occurs when the blood supply to the brain is blocked for a short time. The CDC explained that transient ischemic attack is a warning sign of a future stroke. Snail slime, also known as snail secretion filtrate (SSF) or snail mucin, is a kind of mucus produced by snails. Some studies have found that it is packed with nutrients such as hyaluronic acid, glycoprotein, proteoglycans, antimicrobial and copper peptides, which are used in beauty products, which makes it a popular ingredient in skincare. In a published article by The Guardian, using snail slime on your skin will help fade scarring and stretch marks, kill bacteria, treat acne, promote optimal skin health, and exfoliate. A chief consultant neurologist at Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University Teaching Hospital (ATBUTH), Nura Alkali, said that neither milk nor snake slime can cure stroke.  He said: “I’m aware that some researchers have isolated a chemical called acharan sulfate from the African giant snail. This chemical was found to have anticoagulant properties – meaning it can prevent blood from clotting.  “But even if this is confirmed in human trials, doctors won’t likely use it as a treatment for stroke. Keep in mind that stroke may result from either a blood clot or a bleed in the brain. Obviously, giving an anticoagulant to someone with a brain bleed will make them bleed more, and in fact, even those with brain clots may fare worse with anticoagulant treatment. That is why heparin, an anticoagulant widely used in hospitals, is not used as routine treatment for stroke.” Alkali explained that the right solution to stroke is to take the patient to the hospital for the right treatment. “Managing stroke is not just about dissolving clots. The patient may require oxygen, control of raised blood pressure, treatment of seizures, and so on. These are all best done at the hospital.” He added that “Stroke can be prevented by avoiding or treating the well-known stroke risk factors, which include sedentary lifestyle, obesity, cigarette smoking, excess alcohol use, hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol and heart disease. Changes in lifestyle and regular medical check-ups are the starting steps.” A professor of neurology at the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH), Yomi Ogun, described the claim that the mixture of snail slime and milk to cure stroke as untrue. “There is no scientific evidence to support this claim. Stroke is treatable, not curable,” he said. Another expert, a medical practitioner, Toluwani Binutu, advised that stroke is such a serious condition and it is best to follow what has been proven to get results. “The most obvious repercussion of taking the snail slime and milk mixture is time wastage. Precious time that can be used in implementing proven treatment will be spent trying some experiments which have the potential for harm,” he said. Speaking on the right treatment and prevention for stroke, he explained that the combination of medication, physical therapy and lifestyle changes get the best results. “The best way to reduce the chances of having a stroke is to eat healthy, cut out harmful habits like smoking, excessive alcohol consumption and getting physically active,” he concluded. The claim that water gotten from snails (snail slime) and peak milk can cure partial or full stroke is false. Experts noted that stroke is a serious medical condition and the right solution to stroke is to take the patient to the hospital for the right treatment.

Claim: Viral video on WhatsApp depicts alleged persecution of  Christians in Afghanistan.,"A viral video making the rounds on WhatsApp claims that Christians in Afghanistan are persecuted. The video depicts some persons in full public glare wrapped in a nylon bag. While some lay, apparently unconscious, others merely sat, seemingly stressing to breathe.  The video is accompanied by a short narrative “Christians in Afghanistan Wrapped in nylons to die. It is time to intensify our prayers for divine intervention” the message read.  The video was reflected to have been forwarded many times on WhatsApp with no further clarification to it whatsoever. Conceivably,  this fluid transition the claim has attracted on Nigerian social media space may be linked to the religious aspect of it. A sensitive issue in Nigeria that has never failed to garner attention, especially at a time when many Nigerians fear the Taliban takeover may be feasible in Nigeria, owing to the presence of Boko Haram in which a former Nigerian Navy officer in an interview recently alleged the central goal of the group and their sponsors is   the ‘Islamization’ of Nigeria. Already, the religious crises in Plateau State is causing a divide among the two major religions in Nigeria. As such, this heralding video may indirectly compound social relations in Nigeria if it’s allowed to keep on surfacing on the Nigerian social media space without urgent verification. As such DUBAWA ventures to substantiate the claim’s  veracity. When DUBAWA conducted a keyframe reverse search of the video on InVid verifier (an open access tool for online video verification), results showed that the video was actually taken in Colombia during an Anti-Government protest in the country.  Further findings  revealed  the video was first shared on May 27, 2021 with the heading “performance empaquetados el poblado Medellín paro nacional 26 mayo 2021” which is directly translated as “performance packed the town Medellín national strike May 26, 2021.” Medellín, one of Colombia’s largest cities, was a hub for the  protest that rocked the country in May this year. In fact, the same protest that saw some persons wrapped in  nylon bags was also reported on a Colombian National Daily, a day after it took place.  Apparently, this video is not from Afghanistan, nor does it in any way have anything to do with religion. Even more,  the same video has appeared on another platform with a  different narrative, allegedly implying that COVID-19 patients were wrapped up in plastic bags in Indonesia.  The alleged torture of Christians in Afghanistan, wrapped up in nylon bags is false. The incident took place in Medellin, Colombia during a protest that rocked the country in May.    Look it doesn’t matter whether this video is fake or not still Christians are being persecuted because of their faith and nothing is being said about it. We can go down the list if you want to. There are many incidences of things like this taking place and I believe you know since you are a researcher yourself. So stop making excuses that things like this is not taking place or happening or make excuses for Nigerians although not all but some making them look all righteous and stuff because they are not.

"Claim: A Facebook post recently claimed that Samuel Ajayi Crowther wrote the first book in Igbo language, Isoama-Ibo Primer, in 1857.","Claim: A Facebook post recently claimed that Samuel Ajayi Crowther wrote the first book in Igbo language, Isoama-Ibo Primer, in 1857. There is sufficient evidence to conclude that Samuel Ajayi Crowther wrote the first book in Igbo language, the Isoama-Ibo Primer in 1857. A post, which had been originally shared on Facebook, recently reappeared on WhatsApp with the claim that Bishop Samuel Ajayi Crowther was the person who wrote the first book in Igbo language. The claim was originally made by Adulawo TV on 29 January 2020, and reposted by 5Cees Media on Facebook on January 20, 2020. It claimed that: ‘The first book in Igbo language (Isoama – Ibo: A Primer) was written by a Yoruba man, Samuel Ajayi Crowther (1809-1891) in 1857. ‘The book had 17 pages, with the Igbo alphabets, words, phrases, sentence patterns, the Lord’s Prayer, the Ten Commandments and translations of the first chapters of Matthew’s Gospel. In 1882, Crowther also wrote the “Vocabulary of the Ibo Language”, the first comprehensive dictionary in Igbo. Crowther, a descendant of King Abiodun, an Alaafin of the Oyo Empire, was the grandfather (through his second daughter, Abigail Crowther) of Herbert Olayinka Macaulay (1864-1946), founder of Nigeria’s first political party, whose father, Thomas Babington Macaulay (1826-1878), founded the first secondary school in Nigeria in 1859. #HistoryVille’ This researcher set out to verify whether Bishop Samuel Ajayi Crowther wrote any book in Igbo language, and if indeed the book was the first ever published in Igbo language. Francis W. Pritchett in his compilation of the Igbo Language, where he extensively quoted Louis Nnamdi Oraka’s The Foundations of Igbo Studies (Onitsha: University Publishing Company, 1983) as his source, acknowledged that Ajayi Crowther was one of two missionary linguists of Church Missionary Society (CMS) in Freetown, whom Edwin Norris took along with 12 interpreters, in an 1841 expedition on the Niger to work around Aboh (now Agbor, a city in Delta state) because they needed to communicate in Igbo. He reported that John Clarke also helped (1843 to 1848) to collect vocabularies of African languages, including 250 words and a few numerals written in Igbo. Francis Pritchett thus confirmed that in 1856, Ajayi Crowther was taught Igbo and later in 1857 Crowther produced the first book in Igbo Isoama – Ibo Primer, with the help of Simon Jonas, an Igbo man who came from emancipated slave families who settled in Freetown. The primer has 17 pages, with the Igbo alphabet, words, phrases, sentence patterns, the Lord’s Prayer, the Ten Commandments, and translations of the first chapters of Matthew’s Gospel. Thus, Crowther became the first to use the Lepsius Standard Alphabet. Indeed, it is here confirmed that Ajayi Crowther wrote in Igbo language apart from Yoruba, for Pritchett claimed again that in 1882 Crowther wrote another work, Vocabulary of the Ibo Language, the first comprehensive dictionary in Igbo, stating further that in 1883 Crowther and Frederick Schon jointly revised it and added more words, and finally came out with Vocabulary of the Ibo Language, Part II, an English-Ibo dictionary. However, Pritchett also claimed that the first published book (or material in Igbo was by a German missionary named G.C.A. Oldendorp around 1777. This was in a book, Geschichte der Mission der Evangelischen Bruder auf den Carabischen (History of the Evangelistic Mission of the Brothers in the Caribbean), which contained a few Igbo words, numerals, 13 nouns, 2 sentences. But Ephraim Chukwu clarified this by stating that Oldendorp only ‘recorded some Igbo numerals and nouns’ which will not be sufficient to conclude that it was a book. Other sources appear to disagree that Ajayi Crowther wrote the Isoama-Igbo Primer. For instance, the blogger Oblong Media insisted that it was Simon Jonas who wrote the first manuscript written in Igbo language, Isoama-Ibo Primer, and that it was only published by Samuel Crowther. This position was corroborated by a piece published about a year ago. However, another source, ViaLibri stated that this primer by Samuel Ajayi Crowther was the first work in Igbo language, even though it acknowledged also that Ajayi wrote it. Another source in agreement that Ajayi Crowther was the first to publish a book in Igbo in 1857 was indeed Isoama-Ibo: A Primer. The Indigenous Language Site also acknowledged that Samuel Ajayi Crowther was an ex-slave and teacher who was also an outstanding African linguist, leader, and Africa’s first Anglican bishop. But other sources maintained that Simon Jonas actually assisted Samuel Ajayi Crowther, to produce the primer for the Igbo language in 1857. Professor Sheriff Folarin, a political scientist and historian, affirmed to this researcher that Ajayi Crowther actually wrote a book in Igbo language. “Yes, he did. He and Schon worked on their Igbo language (a little of what Crowther had learnt in S/Leone alongside Igbo slave resettlers) before 1857. He worked on a book in Igbo having engaged one or two former slaves of Igbo origin whom he and Schon took along and one of two they met there who worked with them, in Eastern Nigeria. As time went by, as they stayed in Igboland, they put their hands on a book using Igbo as the language,” he said. Also, Professor Obaro Ikime, Emeritus Professor and eminent historian at the University of Ibadan,  stated that the claim that Ajayi Crowther wrote the first book in Igbo language is valid: “Ajayi- Crowther used the methodology of translation the methodology of translation to bring the book to fruition. Meaning that if he did not conceive of the idea of the book, there wouldn’t have been the need for a translator. He wanted the Igbo to be able to read something in their own language and achieved that. Thus the claim to authorship is valid.” According to Chukwuebuka Oraegbunam of the Department of Linguistics and African Languages, University of Ibadan, the study of written Igbo Language started in West Indies, where the first person that collected and wrote down Igbo words was a pastor of a church group known as Moravian Brethren, G. A. C. Oldendrop in 1777. He published a book where he wrote down a collection of words of African Languages gotten from the slaves that were working on a farm there. He wrote down 13 nominals, and 2 sentences he translated to Igbo. After the abolition of slave trade, most of the slaves in England and America were repatriated and kept at a slave camp in Freetown, Sierra Leone and Fernando Po. It was at this slave camp that people like the linguist Hannah Kilham, a Methodist, J. F. Schon and Ajayi Crowther, both sent by the CMS, took interest in collecting and writing down the languages of those slaves. Crowther showed more interest in Yoruba language while J. F. Schon faced Igbo Language. Chukwuebuka Oraegbunam further informed this researcher that Kilham collected few Igbo words and other African languages spoken at the slave camp. Another attempt was that of the Marchant Richard Lemon Lender who after sailing to the coast of Niger returned to England and submitted a report of his voyage. In his report, he wrote down a few Igbo words that he had collected on his journey. In fact there was another important collection of African Languages which had more Igbo words, phrases and sentences. The work was done by Sigismund Wilhelm Koelle in 1854, tilted Polyglotta Africana In other words, several other attempts were made before Crowther. But Crowther collected all these attempts made by people which were documented, and published them with the title ‘Igbo Premier’ in 1857. Crowther had access to these documents because he was sent by the CMS, so to have a complete text that would act as a guide towards the teaching of Igbo language and also help in their missionary work, he collected them and published them under the above given title. It is evident from the various historical sources explored and the confirmation of historians consulted, that Samuel Ajayi Crowther wrote in Igbo language apart from Yoruba and other languages in which he had competence as a linguist. There is sufficient evidence to conclude that Samuel Ajayi Crowther wrote the first book in Igbo language, especially the Isoama-Ibo Primer in 1857.  The deduction is that he actually pieced together all attempts made by others, and collaborated with his contemporaries to publish the book.

Claim: A viral message circulating WhatsApp has been urging Nigerians to apply for the National Intelligence Agency (NIA) Recruitment via a portal.,"Nigeria’s unemployment rate surged to 33%, second highest on global List in March 2021, according to Bloomberg. This development has grossly contributed to fake employment notifications in the country. Recently a viral post on WhatsApp claims the National Intelligence Agency (NIA) is currently open for employment. The forward-as-received message attempts to direct readers to this portal and a particular email address. The message reads: “NIA Recruitment 2021/2022 Application Form Login Portal NIA – National Intelligence Agency Recru… news-af.feednews.com NIA Recruitment 2021/2022 Application Form Login Portal – Opera News Official https://newsaf.feednews.com/news/detail/f9579ab7a4ff1a628074ab9187528db2news_entry_id=6261168d210718en_ng&news_id= f9579ab7a4ff1a628074ab9187528db2&country=ng&language=en” Since Dubawa has seen similar Job offers that have been used  to mislead unsuspecting members of the society for fraudulent  reasons, it triggered the urge to verify the credibility of the information.  Dubawa clicked the provided portal link, and it opened a new website, a page that urged interested candidates to apply by filling a form and sending their CVs to a certain email address. Underneath the requirements list, another website was given for interested candidates, it reads “How to Apply for NIA Recruitment 2021 www.nationalintelligenceagency.gov.ng Click on Job vacacies Create your profile and start your application” So Dubawa clicked on the new link, which redirected this fact checker to another website. Dubawa observed that the new website has the same information as the previous website. It is obvious the site was not the NIA website. It also observed the spelling and grammatical errors, vacancies is spelt “vacacies.” This fact checker figured out there was no real portal for the job registration because it keeps redirecting Dubawa to similar websites. The National Intelligence Agency (NIA) is a Nigerian government division tasked with overseeing foreign intelligence and counterintelligence operations formed in June 5, 1986. The Nigeria Head of State then, Ibrahim Babangida, issued in June 1986 Decree Number 19, dissolving the NSO and restructuring Nigeria’s security services into three separate organizations under the Office of the Coordinator of National Security.  The new National Intelligence Agency (NIA) was responsible for foreign intelligence and counterintelligence. This reorganization followed a formal investigation of the NSO by former director Umaru Shinkafi. Dubawa contacted a security expert, the Managing Director, Agent-X Security Ltd,  Timothy O. Avele, for clarification on the recruitment procedure for special security agencies like the NIA, and he said Intelligence agencies worldwide and in Nigeria such as the NIA are always committed to hiring exceptional talent for a variety of career opportunities that span the globe to help support their mission.  “The majority of their hiring is done at the entry-level (in-country) through invitation-only hiring events; however, vacancies may be posted for mid- and senior-level positions as mission dictates, but unlike the police and other security agencies including the military, intelligence agencies, recruitment are mostly done in secrecy for obvious reasons and in the case of Nigeria, a federal character principle that must be followed. Of course political interference (who you know) is a Nigerian factor to be considered too. Once a prospective candidate is invited to interview and receives a conditional job offer, he or she must be granted a security clearance before the hiring process can be finalized” he said. Avele added “The government considers many factors when granting security clearances, including citizenship, drug use, medical and personal integrity and conduct. All candidates for this kind of recruitment must be Nigerian citizens and are subject to a thorough background inquiry and any required medical examinations.” Entry-level (in-country) hiring for mid and senior-level positions may be posted but not in the usual way the police and the military advertise their  positions. The second category of employment, that is the intelligence agents or spies is done in total secrecy. It’s never posted for any reason and If the candidate has been selected or is invited to a hiring event, he or she  will receive correspondence from the NIA Avele said the term spy refers to human agents that are recruited by Intelligence officer (professionally called case officer) of an intelligence agency, like NIA, whose primary responsibility is gathering and processing of foreign intelligence on both friendly and hostile nations, including non-state actors. “The process is not advertised. Recruiting process typically begins with “spotting.” Spotting is the identification of targeted people who appear to have access to information, or are attractive for some support role,” he said. “This individual may be “developed” (as in case of foreign university students studying in Nigeria or any other country or foreign businessmen) over a period of time before the approach is made or it could be made”cold. “ “Alternatively, the potential agent may approach the agency; many intelligence assets were not recruited but were “walk-ins” or “write-ins” who offered information to foreign intelligence services” Avele added. He said background research is conducted on the potential agent to identify any ties to a foreign intelligence agency, select the most promising candidates and appropriate method of approach.  The information circulating on WhatsApp that the NIA is now recruiting, via a certain portal, is misleading, as verification has revealed that the recruitment process of the Intelligence Agency is secretive.

Claim: Photos widely shared on social media claim to be from a deadly attack on Igbo passengers in Plateau State by the Fulani.,"Still grappling with insurgency in the North-East, there has been an upsurge of violence in states across Nigeria, with a recurring bloodbath in Plateau State dominating the news in the past weeks. Scores of people including university students have been killed, with many others displaced in violent attacks by armed men suspected to be Fulani herdsmen. Along with banditry and kidnapping, the herdsmen’s attack is one of triggers of current insecurity in Nigeria. The recent sordid development has forced governments of states (especially those in Nigeria’s south) to evacuate their indigenes from Plateau State, amidst suspicions of increased/reprisal attacks. This has aroused concerns amongst many Nigerians about some photos that went viral on Sunday 29th August 2021, with claims that they depicted a deadly attack by the Fulani on about 230 Igbo passengers in Jos, Plateau State. “Breaking News Jos Crisis: Fulani men intersected on 2 luxurious bus (sic) conveying Igbo’s home and set it on fire killing 230 Igbo’s. Every Igbo man in Jos right now should avoid Jos express road and stay indoors, if possible, run to a church or Army barrack,” the message read. “There is an ongoing meeting in Enugu right now by Ohanaeze on how to convey you people back home as soon as possible.” The claim was shared repeatedly on social media including WhatsApp and Facebook, apparently raising concerns for the safety of non-indigenes in Jos, Plateau State, particularly those of Igbo extraction, with a propensity for inter-ethnic clashes. Using the image reverse search, Dubawa identified the source of each of the four photos in circulation. A Bing reverse image search revealed that the photo of the red bus was from a fire incident in Umuahia, the Abia State capital, involving a bus belonging to the Young Shall Grow Motors. Dubawa found from a Google reverse image search that the photo of the white bus in circulation originated from a road accident in Zimbabwe which claimed the lives of 29 passengers. The source of the other photo was traced using the Google reverse image, to the 2015 report of a riot in Ajaoukuta, Kogi State. Meanwhile, the Plateau state government has described as fake the news of the incident. A statement by the governor’s spokesperson, Makut Macham, said members of the public should ignore a social media post purportedly showing luxurious buses on fire with the caption “Plateau crises and genocide worsens as 2 luxurious buses conveying Igbos down East were set on fire with 156 passengers inside.” “This is purely the handiwork of crisis merchants and mischief makers who want to create panic and instigate violence and fear among the people,” it stated. Similarly, the police in Plateau state have also asked the public to disregard the news, as there is no record of such an incident anywhere in the state. “We urge members of the public to disregard and stop the spread of such fake news capable of inspiring unwarranted panic, hatred, negativity, chaos and tribal conflict among the well-spirited residents of Plateau and Nigeria in general,” said police spokesperson, Ubah Ogaba. “We enjoin all citizens to cooperate with the Police and other security agencies by providing prompt and useful information that will help to enhance the security of the state rather than spreading unverified information capable of heating up the polity.” The claim that 230 Igbos commuters were attacked and killed by Fulani in Jos, Plateau State, is fake. Photos widely shared on social media purportedly from the incident are also fake. Dubawa found that all four photos were lifted from unrelated and past events in Zimbabwe and Nigeria.

Claim: President Buhari claims that NNPC’s  N287 billion naira 2020 profit is the first in 44 years.,"On August 26th, President Mohammadu Buhari announced on his verified Facebook page that the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has made a net profit/profit after tax of N287 Billion for the first time in 44 years.  “I am pleased to announce the declaration of Profit after Tax of Two Hundred and Eighty Seven Billion Naira (N287 Billion) in Year 2020 by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation NNPC. This is sequel to the completion of the statutory Annual Audit exercise for Year 2020.” “The NNPC losses were reduced from N803 Billion in year 2018 to N1.7 Billion in year 2019 and the eventual declaration  of Net Profit in Year 2020 for the first time in its 44-year history.” The president said.   Aside from the wide range of media coverage the announcement attracted, Femi Adesina, an  aide to President Buhari  on Media and Publicity, also also wrote a lengthy article  on his Facebook page that underscored how the profit came about. A feat he attributed  to the current administration’s efforts to strengthen the Nigerian economy. “The news came like a thundering typhoon last week. For the first time in its 44-year history, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has made a profit.” “Net profit after tax stood at N287 billion in Year 2020, sequel to the completion of the statutory Annual Audit exercise. What year? 2020. Year of the Coronavirus pandemic, when most of the world, including Nigeria, was under lockdown! And here was NNPC, recording profit for the first time in its history. How did it happen? How can it?” The Presidential aide wrote on his Facebook page. In the article, he went further to explain that  “Well, it happened because perhaps for the first time in the history of the country, and of the NNPC, there is a President who is not using the place like a personal automated teller machine. He’s not collecting millions upon millions of dollars by fiat, nor is he giving directives for any under the table deal. And that President also happens to be the Minister for Petroleum Resources.”  Both the President’s and his Aide’s announcement attracted wide media attention and a plethora of other views. While some experts commended the achievement and gave a positive response to it, others criticized it and even challenged its legitimacy.  One Facebook user, Emmanuel Ogu who commented on Mr. Femi’s post, questioned that   “What jinx did he break after 6 years of non-performance as Minister for Petroleum Resources. I beg don’t come and deceive some of us who can discern between propaganda and the reality on the ground.”  Yet it was not only him, Atebo Peterside, the founder of IBTC Stanbic Bank was reported by Punch Newspaper to have questioned the accomplishment. He was quoted to have said on his Twitter handle that  “There is an allegation that NNPC dipped their fingers in the Federation Cookie Jar in order to announce bumper 2020 profits; they should come clean and publish details of all dividends received by them and tell us which ones they recently diverted from the Federation to themselves.” Another reader, Collins who commented on Peterside’s reported views, reinforced that “It’s impossible for them to have made profit last year when oil price dropped to a near zero. These are people filled with lies, what a shame.” Though Femi Adesina quoted the President, and the President only announced the success, there are no documents or a financial report of the NNPC’S 2020 profit yet. Perhaps it will be out eventually since it is merely a profit announcement. Nonetheless, the questions around the matter, stresses the need for a closer look. Is this the first profit NNPC has made so far in 44 years? Or are there other facts to it? NNPC’s financial report may perhaps have some answers. The corporation back in 2019 published a financial report detailing an audit of its economic activities. In the report, details of NNPC’s 2018 and 2019 financial accounts were made open for public access alongside a five-year financial summary from 2015 to 2019 for the first time since its creation.  The whole crux of the initiative was to encourage transparency and translucency in the financial dealings of the corporation.  Both President Buhari and his Aide, Femi Adesina, said the NNPC made a Net profit after tax for the first time in 44 years (N287 Billion).  However, the financial audit report published by NNPC in 2019  reveals otherwise.  Though from 2015 to 2019 the corporation registered significant losses as presented in the report, in 2017, it did, in fact, made a reasonable Net profit of N111, 591 Billion.  Net profit and profit after tax means the same thing. It is the actual profit after working expenses have been paid or extracted from total income realized.  It should also be noted that digits placed in brackets signifies a loss according to the report, as also clearly identified in ‘Profit (loss) before income’ tax and ‘Profit (loss) after tax’.   According to the financial report,   the corporation registered losses in 2015 and 2016 but made an exception in 2017. However, they fell back to a  heightened level of loss in 2018 (₦803,144 billion)  but reduced drastically in 2019 (1.762 billion).  This clearly reveals that in 2017, NNPC had registered a profit of N111, 591 billion  (highlighted yellow in ‘profit after tax’ above) both under ‘Profit (loss) before income’ tax and ‘Profit (loss) after tax.   In a report  published by NNPC on their website that served as  an access link to the detailed financial report,  the corporation stated that “Barely five months after publishing its 2018 Audited Financial Statement, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has released its 2019 Audited Financial Statement with a 99.7% reduction in its loss profile from ₦803bn in 2018 to ₦1.7bn in 2019.” These are the same digits Buhari quoted in his announcements “The NNPC losses were reduced from N803 Billion in year 2018 to N1.7 Billion in year 2019 and the eventual declaration of Net Profit in Year 2020 for the first time in its 44-year history.”  These amounts were the same   presented in the 2019 and 2018 “Profit (loss) after tax”  of the actual financial report (highlighted red).  Apparently, the corporation’s  2017 financial turnover was left out of the President’s announcements.  When NNPC released its 2018 financial report, it indicated N82 billion loss in 2017. However,  months later, when the 2019 financial reports came out, the group “restated” the 2015, 2016 and 2017 figures. Just this time, the 2017 “restated” figure showed that the corporation made a profit of N111,591 billion instead of the earlier loss documented in the year.  ‘Restated’ in financial statements such as in this case, is  a revision of a previously issued financial statement to correct an error. Portions of a financial statement are required to be restated when it is determined that a previous statement is inaccurate.  Thus the 2015, 2016 and 2017 ‘restated’ figures in NNPC’s 2019 financial statements were corrected.  Conceivably, there might have been a possible communication gap between NNPC and government officials prompting them to proclaim 2020 profit as the first in 44 years by holding on to the 2017 old figure.   A screenshot from NNPC’s 2019 financial report showing the “restated” changes on 2015, 2016, and 2017 financial summary Nonetheless, to seek for more information and clarity over the findings, DUBAWA reached out to NNPC, but received no response from the corporation as of the time of writing this fact check. NNPC’s Two Hundred and Eighty Seven Billion Naira (N287 Billion) 2020 profit is not the corporation’s first-ever profit in 44 years as announced by the president.   A financial report published by the corporation shows it has registered a net profit of N111,591 in 2017. This claim is false.

"Claim: A Facebook User, Olododo Media, put up a post with images of statues depicting them to be that of a town where the ancient occupants turned to statues. The user claimed the village is in Esie, Kwara State.","On August 23, 20121, a Facebook user, Olododo Media made a post tagged “This is the town where all the entire people in the town became statues.’ The post further reads, ‘The town is in Esie, Kwara State.’ The post, as of August 31, had garnered 292 likes and 1.6 thousand shares. Nigeria has a creative custom that dates back thousands of years. While much of the country’s early art had a spiritual or religious significance, many of the traditional arts and crafts progressed over time to include practical and decorative items. Normally, the concept of art can be found in the fact that human beings express their knowledge and values through this means and that is why the art and culture of Nigeria symbolizes the glaring image of the country’s culture and history. So, is Esie town really the one in question where all the entire people in it became statues as depicted in the post? Esie is an ancient Yoruba town in Irepodun local council area of Kwara state and is generally known as a home to about 800 soapstone figures. Esie museum happens to be one of the early museums in the country, and inside it stands some mysterious statues whose origin has remained unknown till date. Esie sculptures are made from stearate (soapstone) and come in various designs and sizes- depicting an array of social roles but mostly featuring men and women who are seated or kneeling while holding on to agricultural or musical instruments. This researcher contacted the Acting Curator of Esie Museum, Johnson Ajayi, to confirm if the statues in question can be found in Esie museum. Mr Ajayi responded, saying “This information is not authentic as these cannot be found in Esie museum. We have statues here but they are not like that.” So, where are the statues of human beings in the pictures situated? A Google reverse image search of the images show that the figurines can be found in Saradiel Village. It is said to be the true habitat of Sri Lakan Robin Hood named  Soora Saradiel, and it is situated in Uthuwankanda- Mawanella. The creator of Saradiel village is Dr. Ariyasena U. Gamage, it was declared open in 2012. The artificially built village spans across 6 acres and showcases different life courses and notable moments in Saradiel’s life. The statues in the Facebook post are not soapstone statues in Kwara state but the artificially built stones/statues of the Saradiel Village in Sri Lanka.

Claim: Lime leaves extract and hot drink (ogogoro) cures toothache.,"Claim: Lime leaves extract and hot drink (ogogoro) cures toothache. There is no scientific evidence that shows the mixture (lime leaf extract  and ogogoro) works for toothache.  Toothache or tooth pain is caused when the nerve in the root of a tooth or surrounding a tooth is irritated. Dental (tooth) infection, decay, injury, or loss of a tooth are the most common causes of dental pain.  Pain may also occur after an extraction (tooth is pulled out). Pain sometimes originates from other areas and radiates to the jaw, thus appearing to be tooth pain. The most common areas include the jaw joint , ear pain, sinuses, and even occasional heart problems. Bacteria growing inside your mouth can contribute to gum disease and dental decay, both of which can cause pain. Often, gum disease will not result in any pain. Recently, a blog post by kanyinzcreativity claims lime leaves extracts when applied to the teeth for 4-5 minutes with 5ml of hot drink in your mouth for another 5 minutes and then rinse your mouth with hot drink (ogogoro) for two days, the pains will go and this will kill the worms in your teeth.  Lime leaves contain some antioxidants. They also contain limonene and citronell which both contribute to the flavor and fragrance of the leaves and have been shown to have antimicrobial properties.  Ogogoro (hot drink) on the other hand also known as “kai -kai” or “Eegun inu igo”, is a popular local gin made from fermented palm wine and sugarcane. It contains 30-60% alcohol.    Dubawa conducted a keyword search which led to some articles and video. An article claims the mixture (lime leaf extract and ogogoro) works for toothache. However, this comes with a warning that the hot drink should not be swallowed but used only to rinse the mouth. Also, a Youtuber who posted the benefits of lime leaf noted that lime leaf can be used for toothache and other purposes.  Meanwhile, in our research on the mixture, Dubawa found out that most of the articles written were on lime extract itself and just a few on the lime leaf extract and ogogoro. Mrs Freda Felix ,a dentist, said  she is aware that lime extract works for toothache as more of a home remedy for toothache but she does not know about lime leaf extract and ogogoro.  “That lime  extract can work to some extent but the ogogoro isn’t something I know to be working for the toothache. “Even the lime extract won’t cure it but will relieve you of the pain for some moment and it comes back again.” Felix added that the lime extract can be used as an urgent home remedy but  she encouraged people to go to dental clinics for proper medication. Miss Bernice Apemiye, a global health nutritionist, said according to the World Health Organization, between 65% and 80% of the populations of developing countries use medicinal plants as remedies.  She also noted that several studies show that different medical plants are used in the treatment of tooth aches in different African countries but Lime leaves and alcohol is not one of them.  “According to several reports, the use of several medicinal plants has a long history of treatment of toothaches, and have long been used worldwide. Several studies carried out showed that in Tanzania ,32 medicinal plants are used in the treatment of toothache in Cameroon, Local communities in Burkina Faso used 62 medicinal plant species for the treatment of oral diseases, of which 41 plants are utilized for the treatment of toothache alone.  “In Madagascar, local communities of Mahajanga used 63 plant species to treat dental pains and 23 plants to treat periodontal diseases. A similar study conducted by Ngari et al. and Delfan et al. also showed that local people in Kenya and Lorestan Province of Iran used 12 and 14 medicinal plants, respectively, in order to get relief from toothache. All these studies didn’t talk about the use of lime leaf and alcohol for the treatment of toothaches”. Though there are few articles that agree with  the claim that lime leaf extract and hot drink (ogogoro) work for toothache, there is no scientific evidence that shows the mixture truly cures toothaches.

"Claim: A frequently shared WhatsApp message claims that sleeping at night without light helps to fight disease in the body, boost human intelligence, and make people look younger.","A viral WhatsApp message said to have been written by one Dr. Akin itemised the benefits of sleeping without light. In the message, the writer, who cannot be authenticated whether as a medical doctor or health expert, and whose first name is not available, claimed that to sleep without night allows the “body to be able to produce a hormone called Melatonin which fights diseases.” The writer of the message also claimed that “study shows that intelligent people all over the world do not sleep at night with lights on.” This message has been shared and re-shared on WhatsApp on a leading micro-messaging platform used to spread misinformation in the world. It reads: “HEALTH BENEFITS OF SLEEPING WITHOUT LIGHT  ~Dr. Akin  1) The body is able to produce a hormone (Melatonin) which fights diseases in the body while asleep at night in the dark only. 2) While asleep in the dark, the brain cells are able to rejuvenate back to their original state ( cells which were damaged due to excessive sunlight and electricity) and function properly.  3) A study shows that Intelligent people all over the world do not sleep at night with lights on. Take note 4) Sleeping in the dark or without light at night, helps the body to fight Insomnia (check the meaning) 5) Melatonin decreases in the day time due to the presence of sun light. Hence you should not allow light at night when the body is ready to produce it again.  6) Melatonin tells us its time to sleep. Lack of it causes sleeplessness. 7) Sleeping without light at night, makes an individual look fresh, lives longer and looks younger all the times. (Healthy). The writer of the message ended it with a bit of advice encouraging people to “learn to sleep at night without a light.” He added that “nothing bad happens to those who practice it. Don’t be scared.” He also encouraged people to share it. Screenshot of the viral WhatsApp message. Credit: Rahaman Abiola According to the National Centre for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH), a United States agency, Melatonin is a hormone the brain produces in response to darkness.  It helps with the timing of circadian rhythms (24-hour internal clock) and with sleep. Melatonin is a hormone primarily released by the pineal gland at night and has long been associated with control of the sleep-wake cycle. In their paper titled Melatonin as a Hormone: New Physiological and Clinical Insights, José Cipolla-Neto and Fernanda Gaspar do Amaral argued that the hormone is “a ubiquitous molecule present in almost every living being from bacteria to humans.” The UK National Health Service (NHS) stated that the hormone can be “manmade”, that is its supplement can be made to fight “short-term sleep problems (insomnia).” Melatonin supplement has also been confirmed to help with certain conditions, such as jet lag, delayed sleep-wake phase disorder, some sleep disorders in children, and anxiety before and after surgery. Melatonin, produced at night, has been established to be significant to the sleep-wake cycle. It helps to fight insomnia and other disorders in the body. However, there is no scientific proof that it fights disease. Naturally, the body is created with an immune system function known as “antibodies” which fights invaders such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and toxins (chemicals produced by microbes).  This is made up of different organs, cells, and proteins that work together. And it can be classified into two: The innate immune system (which every individual is born with); and the adaptive immune system (which one develops when the body is exposed to microbes or chemicals released by microbes.) This looks like an exaggeration. There is no scientific study that established that “intelligent people all over the world do not sleep at night with lights.” Darkness is essential to sleep which is coordinated by the Melatonin hormone discussed above.  Melatonin, known as the hormone of sleep or darkness, “sends a critical signal to the body that it is time to rest. While sleeping itself settles the body and rearranges the cells, there is no scientific proof that sleeping without light contributes to the freshness of the body or the extension of lifespan. Science has naturally attributed young-looking to “genes”, a basic physical and functional unit of heredity made up of Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). DNA is a molecule composed of two polynucleotide chains that coil around each other to form a double helix carrying genetic instructions for the development, functioning, growth, and reproduction of all known organisms and many viruses. A study by the World Health Organisation on “health and ageing” showed that other factors that can contribute to “staying younger” and looking fresh are diets (consumption of vitamins, fruits and vegetables), regular exercise, regular rest, and taking water (good for digestion). When contacted, a health expert at the Ladoke Akintola University of Technology (LAUTECH) Teaching Hospital, Dr Lukman Adefabi, explained that Melatonin is produced by the pineal gland, a small, pea-shaped gland located in the brain. “Melatonin is a hormone that regulates the sleeping-awake cycle. It’s produced in higher quantities in the morning. But when the sun rises, or there is a body exposure to light, the production rate of the hormone can be reduced. Melatonin also increases its production in the evening when the sun is set,” he explained. Dr Adefabi emphasised further that the “major function” of the Melatonin hormone is to regulate the sleep cycle which he also said its supplement can be used to tackle insomnia when one is experiencing sleeplessness. He added that there is no proof that people who sleep without light are intelligent. According to Dr Opeyemi Yakubu of the University Teaching Hospital (UCH) Ibadan, claims that people who sleep at night without light are intelligent is “misleading.” He also added that Melatonin does not fight disease. It only contributes to part of the substance that controls sleep. “Though melatonin forms part of the substance that controls the circadian rhythm, the information contained in the write-up (the viral WhatsApp claim) is not entirely true. So, it is misleading “Intelligence and sleep without night have no correlation,” he said. Circadian rhythms, according to the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS), are physical, mental, and behavioural changes that follow a 24-hour cycle.  These natural processes respond primarily to light and dark and affect most living things, including animals, plants, and microbes.  Darkness or sleeping without light is significant to the production of the Melatonin hormone responsible for the sleeping-awake cycle and fighting insomnia. However, there is no scientific research that links sleeping without light to intelligence or youthfulness.

Claim: A screenshot of Nigeria’s National Flag and NEMA flag alongside the Saudi Arabian Flag is making the rounds on social media platforms. It suggests that it is part of plans to Islamize Nigeria.,"Claim: A screenshot of Nigeria’s National Flag and NEMA flag alongside the Saudi Arabian Flag is making the rounds on social media platforms. It suggests that it is part of plans to Islamize Nigeria.    The screenshot making the rounds on various social medical platforms depicting the flag of Nigeria, NEMA, and that of Saudi Arabia is the norm at any official event between two countries. In this case, it was an event hosted by NEMA at their headquarters in Abuja to commission the newly upgraded ‘Emergency Call Centre’ Supported by King Salman of Saudi Arabia. Thus, the alleged narrative tied to the picture is false.  A picture surfaced on different social media platforms showcasing the flag of Nigeria, that of the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) alongside the flag of Saudi Arabia. The flags were arranged in a building that appears to be an office in which the claimant alleged was the NEMA Headquarters in Abuja.  The National Emergency Management Agency of Nigeria was established via Act 12 as amended by Act 50 of 1999, to manage disasters in Nigeria. Therefore, from inception, NEMA has been tackling disaster related issues through the establishment of concrete structures and measures. In the acclaimed picture, frames of President Buhari, Sadiya Umar Farouq, the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, and the NEMA boss, Mustapha Habib Ahmed, were hung above the flags.  The claimant implied that the presence of the Saudi Arabian Flag signals plans to ‘Islamize’ Nigeria. “This is what I saw today in NEMA Office Abuja, they have brought out their flag. We must continue our prayer for the nation in more serious ways. Are we still wondering what the agenda is all about?”   On Twitter, the same claim resurfaced, with the heading: “This is Nigeria National Emergency Management Agency Office, Abuja. #Taliban”. The post attracted over 2,000 interactions. One user, Roboticanimation (@newbreed1914), even commented that “This confirmed my understanding that Nigeria is stylishly under Saudi Arabia influence.”  Another user, Badman Khaliberry (@Iam_khaliberry) added that “That’s because buhari is a religionist, him time go finish soon ,,, we will return back to a progressing Nigeria.”  The post attracted similar comments that suggested users’ ‘believability’ about the claim. It was also shared by a Facebook user,  Dr. Josh Onyekwelu Chuckuemeka, who implied that  “it is evidence that plans to islamize Nigeria are on course with the hoisting of this flag.” This claim,  emerged days after killings in Jos unfolded along religious lines. A sensitive topic in the Nigerian public sphere that, if ignored, could trigger discord and sow a seed of distrust among the populace. DUBAWA ventures to uncover the truth in the matter.  Preliminary investigations carried out by DUBAWA  revealed that the Saudi Arabian flag was actually hoisted at the NEMA office, Abuja. However, the primary reason behind this act was merely for symbolic courtesy.   On Friday the 13th of August 2021, the National Emergency   Management Agency held an event to commission a newly upgraded ‘Emergency Call Centre’ Supported by King Salman of  Saudi Arabia. As such, the flags were placed there during the event to showcase the ongoing mutuality between the two nations–Nigeria and Saudi Arabia.  The event was covered by National Dailies alongside  the actual narrative that brought about the Saudi Arabian Flag in the NEMA office.  DUBWA further reached out to NEMA via a phone call regarding  the claim. In response,  NEMA’S Head of Media and Public Relations, Manzo Ezekiel  explained that:  “the event was an official engagement and it was normal to hoist Flags of countries involved. He acknowledged that he was aware of the heralding claims and clarified that “the allegation is false as the Agency has not hoisted any strange flag. The Nigerian National Flag and that of NEMA are the only flags in the offices of the Agency. “It is unfortunate that the picture in circulation was taken by suspected mischief makers on Friday 13th August 2021, at the commissioning of NEMA’s newly upgraded Emergency Call Centre. “The Centre was upgraded with support from the King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Centre, which has also provided food assistance to persons affected by insurgency in the North East and banditry in the North West in 2018 and this year.”  He added that  “Flags are very important national symbols. Therefore, it was normal to have flags of Nigeria and that of Saudi Arabia placed behind representatives of the two nations at a bilateral function such as the commissioning of the upgraded Call Centre that was funded by an agency of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for the benefits of Nigerians. “It should be noted that present at the function were representatives of the Embassy of Saudi Arabia and a team from the King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Centre. Afterwards, the Saudi Flag was immediately removed. “This clarification has become imperative to correct the false alarm raised by purveyors of fake news with mischievous intention to misinform the public and create wrong impressions about the Agency. “The General Public is therefore advised to disregard the false alarm and failed campaign of calumny.” Mr. Ezekiel clarifies.  Dubawa went further to examine the image, using an image forensics tool. Results show that the image was NOT altered in any way and also did not emerge anywhere on the internet before Friday 13th, 2021 but after (the day of the event at NEMA).  The Narrative attached to the acclaimed picture making the rounds is false. The Saudi Arabian flag, though hoisted at   NEMA office,  was only because of an event held to commission  the Emergency call centre supported by King Salman of Saudi Arabia. This claim is false.

Claim: Social media users claim Global Times newspaper had reported that President Bio pledged a $200 million donation to the Haitian government to assist their earthquake victims.,"A purported picture edition of The Global Times newspaper dated Thursday, 19th August 2021 and bearing a front page banner headline, “Pres. Bio Pledged To Donate. . .200 Million Dollars To The Haitian Government For Their Earthquake Victims” has been shared on several Facebook groups. This has been met with mixed reactions on social media. Whilst some lamented the toll such a huge donation would have on Sierra Leone’s weak economy, others said the image is fake. This claim came in the wake of a devastating 7.2-magnitude Earthquake that struck the Caribbean nation of Haiti with nearly 1.2 million people estimated to be affected. Several international organizations and governments around the World have responded by sending aid relief to the affected victims of the disaster since it struck on the 14th August, 2021 at 8:29 Haitian local time. According to the Publisher of the Global Times, Sorie Fofanah, the viral front page banner headline image of the newspaper is fake, incorrect and completely different from what was actually published by the publisher and proprietor of the newspaper, on its edition of 19th August 2021. The true edition of The Global Times NewsPaper edition of 19th August 2021 had the banner headline, “VP Juldeh Jalloh Hails Chief Minister.” “The Global Times newsPaper did not have any document or voice record of the President Retired Brigadier Julius Maada Bio making such a claim and as a Journalist working with Global Times and  a Dubawa trainee, I can authoritatively assert that such was not published by our outlet,” said Jane B Mansaray, a reporter at the newspaper. “The headline on the fake edition of the Global Times newspaper is described to be disinformation, with deliberate intention to tarnish and smear the name and reputation of the Global Times Print Media in Sierra Leone,” she added.  The original publication, seen below, had a banner headline reporting that the Vice President, Dr. Juldeh Jalloh, commended the Chief Minister and not about any headline claiming a pledge made by President Bio to Haiti. This can be further confirmed from The Global Times newspaper website to verify the stories covered by the newspaper on the said date.  Further checks with an attache at the Government’s Strategic Communications Unit, Abu Bakar Joe Sesay, revealed that the president did not pledge any such donation. The Global Times newspaper did not publish a story of President Bio pledging any amount to Haiti. It is false and misleading.

"Claim: The Kano State Government, through the Commissioner for Information, has denied stories widely reported across media platforms that Kano’s powerful First Lady, Hafsat Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, popularly known as ‘Goggo’ had anointed the State Commissioner for Local Government Affairs, Murtala Sule Garo, aka Commander as successor to her husband claiming she was quoted out of context and had only “commended his performance”","Claim: The Kano State Government, through the Commissioner for Information, has denied stories widely reported across media platforms that Kano’s powerful First Lady, Hafsat Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, popularly known as ‘Goggo’ had anointed the State Commissioner for Local Government Affairs, Murtala Sule Garo, aka Commander as successor to her husband claiming she was quoted out of context and had only “commended his performance”  A content analysis of the video footage where the Kano state first lady, Hajiya Hafsat Ganduje made the statement including a careful observation of her disposition, length of time she took in making her point and her statement as translated reveals that she was not quoted out of context as claimed by the Kano State Government. The state governments claim therefore is MISLEADING.  The Kano state government has refuted reports attributed to the First Lady, Prof. Hafsat Abdullahi Umar Ganduje in which she is reported to have endorsed Murtala Sule Garo, commissioner for local government and chieftaincy affairs as successor to her husband come 2023. In a statement issued by the state commissioner for information, Malam Muhammad Garba, the State government explained that the governor’s wife was quoted out of contest in the trending video clip on the social media platform. In the video, the statement added, the First Lady was only thrilled by Garo’s performance whom she fondly called Commander and for his support for the policies and programmes of Governor Ganduje and his administration in the state. Recently, media reports were rife that the First lady popularly known as ‘Goggo’ has at a function in Ungogo Local Government Area of Kano State on Saturday while addressing government officials and beneficiaries of an empowerment programme, said Murtala Garo is the ideal person to succeed their government as he posses all the needed attributes. Recall that in the 2019 gubernatorial election, Mr. Garo allegedly disrupted the process by tearing result sheets at Nasarawa Polling Unit of the State which led to the declaration of the election inconclusive.  Garo was arrested by police officers alongside chairman of the Nasarawa LGA Lamin Sani and the state Deputy Governor Nasiru Gawuna for allegedly storming the collation centre and destroying election results sheets. The commissioner, who was almost stripped naked in the fracas, was reportedly beaten to pulp together with his accomplices before being arrested. They were detained at the state police command headquarters in Bompai area and interrogated before they were released on bail. The police command under then CP Mohammed Wakili, nicknamed Singham, vowed to prosecute Garo and Sani but his tenure did not last longer. A content analysis of the video footage where the first lady, Professor Hafsat Umar Ganduje popularly known as ‘Goggo’ made the statement reveals that she was addressing government officials and beneficiaries of an empowerment programme at Ungogo Local Government Area of Kano state and she had spoken at length in praise of the Commissioner for Local Government Affairs, Murtala Sule Garo who was nicknamed ‘Commander’ after the election disruption debacle. In her own words, the first lady had said, “what the governor wants is educated, agile, and hardworking young men to steer the affairs of our Local Governments. He also wants hardworking youths to succeed him. “I remember, while on a short trip. At all times… He is here listening to me, in every battle, there has to be a Commander (Mr. Garo’s nickname) had spent sleepless nights. I swear to God, he didn’t sleep because he was working hard to discharge his responsibility as a commissioner. I hope you chairmen are listening to me? You are hearing this from Goggo’s mouth. “Therefore, these are the people that His Excellency said they would succeed him,” Mrs Ganduje said. A careful observation of her disposition, length of time taken in making her point and her statement as translated reveals that she was not quoted out of context as claimed by the Kano State Government.  Commenting on the matter, Musa Sani Alyu, a broadcast Journalist with Jalla radio 98.1FM Kano said, “What happened was that Goggo spilled the beans. What is on the mind is what is on the face. What the first lady said at the event was very clear and it is directly proportional to the state government’s intention. We all know she is one of the most influential people in the government, that is the reason they opened an office for her, the office of the wife of Kano State governor, which did not happen in Kano prior to now. What Goggo said, the inclination has shown that’s what’s on her mind and she wants him to be the candidate because he is her puppet. Everyone knows the depth of his loyalty to the first lady. So she was clear enough and they tried as much to retract the anointment but the damage had already been done. As a broadcast journalist in Kano, i carefully follow all the news and i am much interested in the affairs of Kano state government and i know the first lady meant what she said. Lets wait till 2023 you will see unexpected things happening especially on gubernatorial candidates.”  Also commenting, Nura Yusuf, a Kano based public affairs commentator said,“Goggo could not hide her emotions anytime it comes to Sule Garo because If he hadn’t played the role he played at the Nassarawa collation center during the 2019 gubernatorial elections, there would be no Ganduje government today. The state governments claim is just damage control because it was obvious some forces within the party were upset on the issue that was why they brought something that will whitewash the statement,”  Another commentator, Salis Mohammad Manaja, a political analyst observed that the story was not debunked until about two days after when the issue started generating rancour within the party. “They did that to control the internal crisis emanating within the government, it would have been better if the government had claimed that the first lady preempted the situation rather than denying what is obvious from the clip we saw,” Manager said.  Arguments by the commentators are consistent with the image repair theory in crisis communication, a subspecialty of the public relations profession which is designed to protect and defend an individual or organisation facing reputational challenges. The image repair theory (IRT), recommended by Professor William Benoit, a scholar in the field of political communication, University of Missouri, identifies five general approaches to responding to accusations or suspicions. These are Denial, Evading Responsibility, Reducing Offensiveness, Corrective Action, and Mortification. Based on content analysis of the video footage of the subject matter, and arguments from public affairs commentators, claims by the Kano State government that the first lady, professor Hafsat Umar Ganduje did not endorse Murtala Sule Garo, commissioner for local government and chieftaincy affairs as successor to her husband come 2023, is MISLEADING.

Claim: A Facebook page posted on August 24th that N-power has started shortlisting its candidates.,"As seen above, a Facebook page, Badarubala Tv with over 100 followers posted on August 24th, a “breaking news.” This post informed the public that NPower has started shortlisting candidates for the two-year programme. The post asked readers to dial a provided code to check their N-Power status. Since being published, this post has generated over 50 shares and one comment.  The only comment on the post reads: “I check by showing data not found in pre-selected document.” This comment as well as the ‘Breaking News’’ tag on the post (which is reminiscent of fake platforms) calls for scepticism and the urgent need to fact-check. Setting out to check this claim, Dubawa found reports from thenationonlineng and legit.ng both supporting the claims registered in the Facebook post.   Both news platforms reported that the minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development,  Sadiya  Farouq, on August 23 has announced the inauguration of  N-Power Batch C (stream 1 ) at the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja. Farouq reportedly said 450,000 have been selected (out of the about six million applications received from applicants) to benefit under the graduate component for Batch C stream 1. She added that the USSD ‘ *45665# ‘ has been secured to provide the connectivity and technical help for the provision of information services to beneficiaries of the programme.   The claims were further affirmed to be true on the N-power website as shortlisted candidates were asked to enrol their biometric data to qualify them for the final stage of the N-power Batch C (stream 1) programme.  Further, Joshua  Ezra, who is an applicant for the N-power programme, said it is true, adding that the exercise has started since June.  “They flagged up the programme on Monday.  They have been shortlisting since June. This time around, they flagged up the programme but we are yet to be deployed to our place of primary assignment, ” he said.

Claim: A WhatsApp message that has been forwarded many times purportedly from Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH) contains several claims about things that are dangerous for women’s health.,"Teaching hospitals deliver superior health care to patients due to their pools of medical experts, premium diagnostic machines, and links to medical schools. Citizens take medical advice coming from teaching hospitals seriously and with regard. A viral social media message that has been forwarded many times on WhatsApp with the heading “MESSAGE FROM LAGOS STATE UNIVERSITY TEACHING HOSPITAL (LUTH)” claims that 56 girls died because they used certain brands of sanitary pads. The message also cautioned women against several actions that are alleged to be responsible for different forms of cancer. The message was concluded by urging recipients to share it with both men and women, and in “at least one group.” Dubawa did a first level analysis of the message and discovered a serious technical inconsistency. There are two government-owned teaching hospitals in Lagos State; one is the federal owned Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH) affiliated with the University of Lagos, while the second is Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH), which is affiliated with Lagos State University. The heading, however, said the message is from “Lagos State University Teaching Hospital” which is LASUTH but wrote the acronym as “LUTH.”  As LUTH was highlighted as the source of the message, Dubawa reached out to LUTH and a representative of the organisation, Dr. Wasiu Adeyemo told Dubawa that the message “is not from LUTH” and that it “had been in circulation for years.”  As the viral message contains various claims about women’s health, Dubawa reached out to two Consultant Gynaecologists to comment on the significant claims in the message. Dr. Fatimat Rabiu, a Consultant Gynaecologist and MD/CEO of Shifa Medical Centre, Lagos, Nigeria, said women can wash their private parts with mild soaps, and they should “use a thin layer mildly on their palms and then use their palms to wash the area.” She said the scrubbing of the soap physically on their privates is a no-no, and that “women’s vaginas have a natural flora and microorganisms that normally protect the area and using medicated soaps and harsh chemicals will affect or destroy those microorganisms.” A Consultant Gynaecologist and former Chief Medical Director (CMD) of Randle General Hospital, Lagos State, Nigeria, Dr. Kunle Oni, told Dubawa that there are authorities who approve sanitary pads before they are released into the market and “no responsible government will approve the distribution of pads if there is any indication that they can harm women.”  Dr. Rabiu agreed with Dr. Oni, adding that women should however change their sanitary towels after a maximum of five hours, whether they are soaked or not, for hygiene and health purposes. Dr. Oni mentioned that there is no medical evidence that wearing black bras in summer has any negative effects on women’s health and that the colours of the briefs that women wear do not have medical implications.  Dr. Rabiu holds the same opinion, but added that there are assumptions that some people find it comfortable to wear black bras for days without washing them. She encouraged women to be very neat with their underwear but asserted that the colour of a bra alone, without any other factor, cannot harm a woman’s health. Dr. Oni said that this assumption has not been medically tested. He mentioned that there are no known components that are unique to women’s chests to require women not to expose their chests when they are under the sun. In the opinion of Dr. Rabiu, while women should generally not expose themselves to scorching sun, there is no special damage caused by the chest being exposed to the sun. In her words, “the early morning sun is even good for people, especially children, due to its Vitamin D components.” Dr. Rabiu is of the view that there are no significant differences in both antiperspirants and deodorants. She believes that women should maintain good hygiene to reduce the use of both and that they should not use it to replace the need for regular baths. Dr. Rabiu also suggests that women should wear deodorants and antiperspirants on their clothes rather than on their skins or chests. In her words, “the only major difference between the two is that aluminium is added to antiperspirants to reduce sweat production in addition to removing odour, while deodorants just remove odours alone. The aluminium added has not been medically proven to cause any harmful effects.” The claim of the viral WhatsApp message as originating from Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH) is false and misleading. The teaching hospital did not author the message. Medical experts have also disagreed with some of the claims in the message.

"Claim: Jack Dorsey, the chief executive officer (CEO) of Twitter, the microblogging platform, recently tweeted that 32% of Nigerians own Bitcoin.","Claim: Jack Dorsey, the chief executive officer (CEO) of Twitter, the microblogging platform, recently tweeted that 32% of Nigerians own Bitcoin. This piece of information is false. Jack quoted the result of an online poll which only surveyed about 1000-4000 respondents from Nigeria which cannot be used for generalisation. On August 14, Dorsey took to his handle and wrote: “Wow: ‘32 percent of Nigerians own Bitcoin, the highest percentage in the world…” with a Nigerian flag attached.  The author, in an obvious rebuttal to the stance of United States Senator to Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren, on the new currency, wrote a letter to the Senator titled, ‘Why Progressives Should Love Bitcoin: An Open Letter to Senator Elizabeth Warren.’ Messing had highlighted instances where Warren expressed concerns over the perceived unlawfulness of the new currency.  Warren, a longtime bitcoin sceptic, had once said cryptocurrency is powered by a “shadowy faceless group of super coders.” She had also described it as a “scam,” a “bogus private digital money,” “highly opaque,” and “built to assist criminals“.  Warren recently urged Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to identify and remedy risks posed by cryptocurrencies and to craft a “comprehensive and coordinated” framework through which federal agencies can continually regulate virtual coins. Messing argued that rather than Warren’s perception, Bitcoin is the most democratised form of money ever created, highlighting the benefits such as a fixed and predetermined monetary policy; a decentralised, transparent, democratic network.  While further buttressing her argument, she quoted the outcome of a survey by Statista, a popular database company saying, “…32 percent of Nigerians own Bitcoin, the highest percentage in the world…” Jack had obviously lifted this part of the article and shared it on his platform generating over 4, 000 retweets and about 19, 000 likes as of the time of this report. The Twitter CEO has remained consistent in his support for the Bitcoin revolution among Nigerians and was one of the campaigners for the use of cryptocurrency during the #EndSars protests. Dubawa ran a keyword search on google and found out the claim that 32 percent of Nigerians use bitcoin had been misquoted from the outcome of a survey by Statista, an online portal that provides data on the global digital economy, industrial sectors, consumer markets, public opinion, media, demography, macroeconomic trends among others.  The Statista Global Consumer Survey 2020 selected respondents from 74 countries and Nigerian respondents were the most likely to say they used or owned cryptocurrency. Nigeria ranked 32% higher than some citizens from countries even within the G7 with the United States, Germany and Japan with 6%, 5% and 4% respectively.  However, it was explicitly stated that respondents from each country were just about 1,000 to 4, 000.  Meanwhile, Triple A, a Singapore financial company, noted that there are over 300 million crypto users worldwide with 13 million of them in Nigeria representing just 6.31% of the over 200 million population of the country.  Researchers can generalise if they meet up with a certain number of the sample size.  According to Worldometer, Nigeria currently has an estimated population of over 212,000,000 people. This means that using a meagre 1000 — 4000 respondents from Nigeria cannot be generalised. Statista might have factors considered before arriving at a sample size but this is not enough to say 32 percent of Nigerians own Bitcoin. This number might be lesser or even more. This report has been quoted several times in the past by different media houses including BBC Africa, Coin Desk and here. These reports have adequately confirmed that the figure represented the respondents of the survey, unlike Messing whom Jack quoted.  It cannot be authoritatively said that 32 percent of Nigerians own Bitcoin. Rather, 32 percent of Nigerians who partook in the survey conducted by Statista own or use Bitcoin.

"Claim: A viral video claims the late King of Pop, Michael Jackson, had sung a song titled “waiting for the call” in which he stated that he is waiting for the call of Allah to perform Hajj among his ‘Muslim brothers,’ with further claims that it was purchased by Saudi Arabia by paying off debts accrued during the production and the song is now being used for Hajj operations.","Claim: A viral video claims the late King of Pop, Michael Jackson, had sung a song titled “waiting for the call” in which he stated that he is waiting for the call of Allah to perform Hajj among his ‘Muslim brothers,’ with further claims that it was purchased by Saudi Arabia by paying off debts accrued during the production and the song is now being used for Hajj operations. The song in the widely circulated video was sung by Irfan Makki, a Pakistani-Canadian singer with a silky, soothing voice that could pass for Michael Jackson’s, and not by Michael Jackson. Therefore, claims that Michael Jackson sang the song before his death which was later purchased by Saudi Arabia is FALSE. The video was shared mostly on WhatsApp with the following caption, “Michael Jackson an American artist completed this song b4 his death which never get released. Then Saudi Arabia purchased this song on the occasion of Hajj by paying all the debts accumulated on its production and bought its copy rights. It is about Kaaba, Black stone,  Safa/Marwa, Zam Zam water, throwing of pebbles, and all about other Hajj rituals.  Pls listen and enjoy the song. It is an amazing performance (sic).” Part of the song’s lyrics reads: “Miles away, oceans apart…When the day will come, Standing there before you, Accept this Hajj of mine, Standing in ihram, making my tawaf, Drinking blessings from your well, the challenges that I have suffered Rekindles my imaan O Allah! I am waiting for the call, praying for the day when I can be near the Kabah wall, O Allah! I am waiting for the call, praying for the day when I can be near Your Kabah wall,” Michael Joseph Jackson was an American singer, songwriter, and dancer who was dubbed the “King of Pop.” He was and still is regarded as one of the most significant cultural figures of the 20th century. Over a four-decade career, his contributions to music, dance and fashion, along with his publicized personal life, made him a global figure in popular culture. He influenced artists across many genres, and through stage and video performances, popularizing complicated dance moves such as the moonwalk, to which he gave the name, and the robot. He is the most awarded music artist in history. He died on 25th June, 2009. A simple online search of the term “who sang waiting for the call” turned up the name Irfan Makki, a Pakistani-Canadian singer with a silky, soothing voice that could pass for Michael Jackson’s. Makki has a music album with 13 tracks titled “I Believe”, featuring the Swedish-Lebanese musician Maher Zain. Several other links point to the same singer with the same song, same lyrics and Makki’s name featuring as the singer on several websites where it was uploaded including on dezeer – a French online music streaming service which allows users to listen to music content from record labels. It was also found on Universal Music Group, Sony Music and Warner Music Group as well as podcasts on various devices online or offline – and on Amazon Music, therefore, establishing that the song was actually sung by Makki and not Michael Jackson. According to business insider, Michael Jackson was reportedly at least $400 million in debt when he died unexpectedly in 2009 but his estate has resolved the financial issues and Michael has been the top-earning dead celebrity since 2012. While most of his debts were reportedly due to numerous expensive lawsuits, properties and jewelries, there was nowhere it was reported that Jackson accumulated debts on the production of any song which may have prompted Saudi Arabia to offset after his death. A further online search of the key words “Michael Jackson Saudi Arabia” and “Saudi Arabia Waiting for the call,” among alternate keywords did not reveal any reasonable news item that validates the claim. Claims that late pop star, Michael Jackson, sang an Islamic song before his death, accumulated debts during production of the song which are now being paid off by Saudi Authorities with proceeds from the song that is now being used during annual pilgrimage to Medina is FALSE.

The forward-as-received message states that applications are expected from all parts of Nigeria to fill vacant positions, urging interested persons to forward their applications and CVs via : [email protected] The post reads: “KADUNA UPDATE: EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES   Nigeria’s first steel manufacturing plant comes on-stream in Kagarko Local Government, Kaduna State after more than 50 years of failed efforts in Ajaokuta.  There is a multi billion naira Iron ore mining company located in Gujeni, Kaduna State, 19 km from Abuja. The mining plant is situated on over 500 hectares of land with an expected workforce of 2,000 workers made up of Nigerians and 300 expatriates. The plant is under construction and the first phase is about to be completed and will resume operations by January 2022. A massive national workforce is required and experienced hands are also required to support the Iron Ore Processing Project to run effectively. The iron will then be further processed into steel in Nigeria. Be part of this historic feat by applying! Urgent Positions required are: 1. Field Engineer 2.

Instrumentation Technicians 11. Chemist 12. Planning Engineer Applications are expected from all parts of Nigeria. All applications/CVs should be sent to : [email protected]“ The same claim has also been making the rounds on Facebook. The Governor of Kaduna State, Nasir El-Rufai, has also shared the same claim on his verified Facebook timeline which attracted massive traction from users. It garnered close to 3,000, over 450 comments and around 1,000 shares. A user,  Abdulrahman Abubakar,  who reacted to the post on the Governor’s timeline inquired thus, “The email address given is not working, Sir, are there any alternative methods for sending the CV to the company?”  Another user, on WhatsApp, discredited the job offer “this is fake, you should be careful where and to whom you share your CVs.”  Regardless of the diverse opinions, similar Job offers have been used by charlatans to collect the personal information of unsuspecting members of the society for fraudulent and malicious purposes.  As such, DUBAWA opts to verify the veracity of the information.  DUBWA first surveyed websites of both the Federal Ministry of Mines and Steel and the Kaduna State Government to find out  if there is any information regarding the recruitment. But no such information emerged.  Further query on the identity and activities of the  company  showed that the  mining company is registered with the  Corporate Affairs Commission  with the name “African Natural Resources and Mines” (ANRML), in 2012.  However, the registration status reads “inactive” which means the company has not filed its annual returns up to date. Dubawa contacted the special adviser on media and communications to the governor of Kaduna state, Muyiwa Adekeye, via text message, and he confirmed the company is accepting applications as published  the Governor’s page.  He clarified that, “The message is authentic, the company is currently recruiting to start operation by January 2022.”  Other facts gathered  from the response also revealed the recruitment is in bid to achieve a novel feat by the mining company.  In fact, the company has been working on the initiative for over 9 years now.  African Natural Resources and Mines (ANRML)  is an African Industry Groups Company, and it started setting up an Integrated Iron Ore Mining and Processing Plants Project, first of its kind in Nigeria. The Project will mine over 4.704 Million tonnes of Iron ore per annum to scale up to 5.88 million tonnes per annum. The Iron ore resource is certified as per NI 43 101 international standards by a reputed international agency and has completed the Techno Commercial Viability (TCV). ANRML has conducted Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) as per IFC performance standards. The steel plant will generate 36 megawatts of electricity to the national grid and would boost the already generated megawatts of power for other economic activities and increase power supply to Kagarko Local Government to help develop other industries and urbanize the local area. The company’s steel will also carry out beneficiation, pelletizing and converting of iron into direct used iron for steel manufacturing and that it will galvanise the industrial space into a hub of production of finished goods for local consumption and export. No, the history of Nigeria’s attempt to develop the steel industry in Nigeria dates back to the establishment of the Ajaokuta Steel Project in September 1979. Designed as an integrated iron and steel complex, the first phase was designed to produce 1.3million tonnes (MT) of liquid steel per annum with capacity to expand to 2.6 MT and 5.2MT in three phases. The Federal Government also established the Delta Steel Company in Aladja which was commissioned in 1982, (now privately owned) with a capacity of 1.0MT per annum.  Agbaja Iron Ore Project, in Kogi state was completed in January 2014, and the production of iron ore concentrate was anticipated to start by the end of 2016 or early 2017. These companies have, however, not been fully functional owing to a myriad of factors including poor corporate governance. No doubt the African natural resources and mines company is the first major investment in the mining sector in more than two decades, but not the first mining company in Nigeria. The project will have a capacity of 5.4 metric tonnes per annum and will create 3,500 direct jobs and thousands of indirect jobs if it actively starts to operate in 2022. Findings have revealed the claim circulating on  WhatsApp asking Nigerians to apply for the vacancies in the multi-billion naira Iron ore mining company,  located in Gujeni, Kaduna State is true. The initiative is  intended to boost the  massive national workforce that is hoped to  resume operation by January 2022. Hence the claim is true.

"Claim: Nigeria’s Guardian Newspaper, Sahara Reporters, Opera News and other local media claim that soldiers killed and injured Farakwai youths who were chasing bandits from their community on Wednesday, July 21, 2021.","Banditry has now reached an all time high in Nigeria, with constant reports of school kidnappings, murders and attacks on villages. The Nigerian government, as well as the international community are concerned, and rightfully so, as banditry is threatening food security, national mobility, foreign trade and is further discouraging more parents in Northern Nigeria from sending their children to school. It is, therefore, not surprising that local communities have created vigilante and hunter groups to protect and defend themselves against bandits as the federal government has not succeeded in exterminating the dreaded groups. Therefore,this situation can explain the dismay of citizens when a reputable media organisation like The Guardian Newspaper, along with other online media and blogs like Sahara Reporters, Opera News, Lindaikeji Blog, Tori.ng, Olorisupergal and Naijalumia report that Nigerian soldiers attacked youths who were chasing bandits from their community, killing three and leaving about 10 others hospitalised. The incident reportedly occurred on Wednesday, July 21, 2021 in Kwanar Farakwai village, Igabi Local Council of Kaduna State. But, what actually happened? Would Nigerian soldiers kill and harm youths trying to protect their people and community?  Dubawa read all the news stories about the event published on The Guardian Newspaper, Sahara Reporters, Opera News, Lindaikeji Blog, Tori.ng, olorisupergal, as well as Naijalumia, and the narratives were all the same. Youths from Kwanar Farakwai village in Igabi Local Council of Kaduna State, which happens to be some kilometres away from Zaria were chasing away kidnappers from their village when the kidnappers entered a cave. The youths were said to have beseeched the cave and it was alleged that a company around the area thought the youths were the criminals, they called security operatives to the scene and the soldiers on arrival killed three youths and injured about 10 others. An indigene and resident of Kwanar Farakwai village, Dr. Bashir Mijinyawa, told Dubawa that the incident did not happen at Farakwai, a town about 15 kilometres to Zaria. Dr. Mijinyawa said that the narration in the media is far from reality, noting that about 23:00 hours on July 23rd, 2021, some bandits attacked the Maraban Jos Division Police Headquarters in Kaduna, storming the station in three Sharon buses to override the divisional armoury but they were resisted by operatives. And that bandits did not attack Farakwai Village on that date and no youths were killed by soldiers. Dubawa also received a press statement by the Kaduna State Police Command dated July 24th, 2021 stating that the state’s police command on Maraban Jos was attacked but that the force fought them off. The press release was signed by ASP Muhammad Jalige, the Police Force Public Relations Officer for the Commissioner of Police, Kaduna State Command. There was no mention of Kwanar Farakwai youths nor of report of any encounter with them. The news stories on the killing of youths in Kaduna state are false and misleading. There is no evidence that youths in Kwanar Farakwai were killed and injured by soldiers. The only recorded incident that happened in Kaduna State between Wednesday 21st and Friday 23rd, 2021 was an attack on the Maraban Jos Divisional Police Station in Kaduna State.

"Claim: A tweet shared on Twitter claims that Kenya took  87 athletes and 90 officials, a ratio of 1:1, to the Olympics while China took 200 athletes  and 20 officials, a ratio of 1:10","Even though Kenya emerged top in Africa in the recently concluded Tokyo 2020 Olympics, concern about the team’s performance, compared to the previous record in Rio, kindled speculations on social media. Some Kenyans attributed the setback in Tokyo to the ratio of athletes taking part in events.  One such claim shared by a user on Twitter on 2nd August 2021, already garnering 241 retweets, 8 quote tweets and 773 likes alleged that Kenya took 87 athletes and 90 officials, a ratio of 1:1, compared to China’s 200 athletes to 20 officials, a ratio of 1:10.  The Olympics, bringing together the world’s best athletes, is one of the most-watched events worldwide. Although the threat of COVID-19 raised the question of whether the quadrennial competitions would and should take place, the 2021 Olympics did proceed and deliver an exciting thrill. The USA ranked top in the world, winning a total of 113 medals-39 gold, 41 silver and 33 bronze, with China coming in second place with 88 medals.  Despite a slow start at the Tokyo Olympics, Kenya maintained its reign as Africa’s champions by sealing a first-place finish with 10 medals. While the team did emerge successful in Tokyo, the Rio 2016 Olympics remains the best Olympic performance in Kenya’s history and the most embarrassing. Kenya, which first participated in the Olympics in 1956 in Melbourne, competing in events in athletics, hockey, shooting and swimming, has sent athletes to compete in every Summer Olympic Games since then, except for the boycotted 1976 (Canada) and 1980 (Russia) Olympics.  In 2016, Kenya returned home from the Rio Olympics with six gold medals, six silver medals, and one bronze—winning the most medals of any African team. Kenya came in 15th globally in medals, and was second only to the United States in track and field medals.  However, Kenya’s glorious moment was dogged by allegations ranging from mismanagement,  corruption and bribery and misappropriation of team uniforms provided by Nike, which were intended for athletes to wear during the opening ceremony of the Rio Olympics but got missing. Six officials were implicated in the scandal. It was also alleged that Team Kenya allowed unauthorized people to travel to Rio and some athletes were stranded in a shanty town in Rio. The Rio scandal not only tarnished Kenya’s name but left Kenyans in embarrassment and skepticism that boiled over to the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. In January 2021, The National Olympics Committee Kenya (NOCK), which had an uphill task in getting back in Kenya’s good books, issued a statement resolving to deliver a well managed, well financed, and best resourced Kenya team for 2020. The aim, they stated, was to have over 100 athletes participating in the 2020 games later postponed to 2021. According to the official Olympics website, the National Olympics Committee Kenya had 87 athletes across nine disciplines; however, the team Kenya website listed 110 athletes. The International Olympics Committee permits a maximum number of 3 entries for individual events per country. Nonetheless, both websites do not list the total number of officials that formed the Team Kenya and Delegation for Tokyo.  In adherence to COVID-19 protocols, athletes and officials had to travel in batches. The first batch of Team Kenya, based on news reports, left Kenya on 6 July 2021 and consisted of the chef de mission, Waithaka Kioni and chief executive Officer, Wangui Kibe alongside athletes’ representative, Humphrey Kayange and COVID-19 liaison officer Susan Adhiambo. The rest of Team Kenya departed between 9 July and 2 August, but there is no official record of the team Kenya’ delegation.  Dubawa made efforts to reach the COVID-19 liaison office for clarification on the claim but the liaison office has not responded as of press time. No evidence supports the claim that Kenya took 87 athletes and 90 officials to the Olympics, a ratio of 1:1, whereas China took 200 athletes and 20 officials, a ratio of 1:10. From the Official Team Kenya website, the team had 110 athletes, but we cannot verify the information on the officials. China, on the other hand, took 431 athletes and 146 officials.

Claim: A Facebook post claimed that kidney stones are formed when one does not drink an adequate amount of water.,"Over the years, questions on how much water one should drink a day have been in public discussions. A recent example is a screenshot of a Facebook post by Nurse Abigail Esang with a claim that kidney stones form when one does not drink adequate amount of water. The image was tagged, “This is what forms in your kidney when you don’t drink adequate amount of water. It’s called kidney stone. It’s formed as a result of salt on other minerals clogging together. It forms stones in the kidney. Drink enough water, water does not have over dose. Love you all. Share to spread awareness.” This researcher also found out that the message was copied from a post by Nairaland Forum which has garnered over 56,500 views since it was posted in 2018. Before now, water has been said to be good for the body , this is just as some note that it is important to drink plenty of fluids, especially when the temperature is hot outside. According to studies water keeps every system in the body functioning appropriately through aiding digestion, preventing constipation,  carrying nutrients and oxygen to the cells among others. It also gives the body enough fluids to carry out necessary tasks required by proper hydration. Experts also note that the daily four to six cups of water rule is for healthy people and it is possible for some to take in too much water if they have certain health conditions, such as kidney, liver or heart problems and thyroid diseases or if one is taking medications that retain water in the body such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). A kidney stone is a hard object that is made from chemicals in the urine. Urine has various wastes dissolved in it. When there is too much waste in too little liquid, crystals begin to form. The crystals attract other elements and form together into a solid that gets even larger unless it is passed out of the body with the urine. The stone forming chemicals are calcium, oxalate, urate, cystine, xanthine and phosphate. After it is formed, the stone may stay in the kidney or trail down the urinary tract into the ureter. But stones that do not move may cause a back-up of urine in the kidney, ureter, the bladder or the urethra and this is what causes the pain. What causes kidney stones According to the Urology Care Foundation, a major risk of kidney stone is constant low urine volume. Low urine may come from dehydration- which is loss of body fluids, from hard exercise, working or living in a hot place, or not drinking enough fluids. Concentrated urine means there is less fluid to keep salts dissolved. Increasing fluid intake will dilute the salts in the urine and by doing this, one can reduce the risk of stones forming. Other factors that can lead to kidney stones include: diet, bowel conditions, obesity, medical conditions such as (abnormal growth of the parathyroid glands) or distal renal tubular acidosis , medication and family history/genetics among others. This is also corroborated by the Harvard Medical College, where it states that a risk factor for all stones regardless of type is dehydration. Anyone who is prone to kidney stones should pay attention to good hydration, adding that a randomized trial has shown that drinking 2 liters of fluid a day reduces the likelihood of stone recurrence by about half. The American Urological Association guideline for medical management of kidney stones also recommends that patients who form kidney stones should aim to drink more than 2.5 liters of fluids per day. For the studies, it is concluded that all kidney stone sufferers should remember the phrase, “Dilution is the solution to the Pollution.” Good hydration is a safe and useful therapy for all stone formers. A Consultant Nephrologist with the University of Medical Sciences Teaching Hospital (UNIMEDTH), Dr Akinwunmi Akinbodewa, said although not drinking enough water does lead to the formation of kidney stones, it is not, however, an absolute factor as kidney stone is a combination of genetic and environmental factors. “Yes it is true that not drinking enough water can lead to kidney stones, but it is not absolute, we have other factors like genetic and environmental ones. Genetic in the sense that some people are stone formers, they form stones in their body like in the pancreas, bladder, kidney etc. and so they tend to form stones. It is hereditary, so even if they drink enough water or do not drink enough water,  they would still form kidney stones,” he said. “And for the environmental factor, such could arise from one’s diet as there are different types of the kidney stones – acid or alkaline. So, if someone is having too much acid in the system it will result in acidic stones. Take for instance, eating certain chemicals that will form acid like preservatives, one is likely to develop acidic stones. And if you are consuming alkaline, say like vegetables, what you find is that you have alkaline types of stones.” he added. Dr Akinbodewa noted that kidney infections too could lead to the formation of kidney stones and as such the formation of kidney stones is not only limited to one not drinking enough water but is hinged on many other factors. Although not drinking enough water can lead to kidney stones, it is not absolute as there are other factors such as diet, bowel conditions, obesity, medications and family history/genetics which can lead to the formation of kidney stones.

Claim: Did the Sierra Leone Government enforce compulsory vaccinations for employees of government institutions to accelerate the administration of vaccines before they expire?,"The Government of Sierra Leone through its COVID-19 response body National COVID-19 Emergency Response Centre (NaCOVERC) issued a public notice on 17th June 2021 instituting measures to combat the third wave of the virus in Sierra Leone. One regulation stated that “Government ministries, departments and agencies will only be accessed by employees and members of the public with proof of at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccination.” Though not stated in clear terms, the notice was enforcing compulsory vaccinations for people especially employees who want to access the offices.  NaCOVERC say the decision was informed by the Word Health Organisation (WHO) reports and by an examination of the epidemiological data, which showed increasing cases of COVID-19 and related deaths. However, there were public speculations that the Sierra Leone Government was enforcing vaccinations because the vaccines available were about to expire. Sierra Leone received 96,000 doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine on 8th March 2021 shipped through the COVAX Facility, a partnership between the Government of Sierra Leone, Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), Gavi, United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and WHO.  On 20th March 2021, 42,000 doses of the Oxford-Astrazeneca vaccine were sent by the African Union’s African Vaccine Acquisition Task Team (AVATT) which redistributed 925,000 doses to 13 countries on the continent. Two hundred thousand (200,000) doses of Sinopharm vaccines were donated to Sierra Leone by the Chinese Government and later in April an additional 40,000 doses from China’s Ministry of Defense to the Sierra Leone Defense Ministry specifically.  Altogether, Sierra Leone has received 378,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccines. The official vaccine rollout in the West African state started on 15th March 2021, targeting people over 70, teachers, firefighters, government officials and health workers. The launch ceremony of the vaccination campaign  took place at State House in the capital Freetown where some government officials, including President Julius Maada Bio, were vaccinated.  According to Dr Tom Sesay, the Vaccine Pillar Lead for NaCOVERC, by 31st May 2021, before Sierra Leone released the new regulations under the third wave of COVID-19, 72,888 people had received their first dose and 17,502 people had received their second dose of vaccines. This makes up 1.44% of the population 18 years and above targeted for vaccination.  The Sinopharm vaccines donated by China are due to expire in February 2023. The batch of 42,000 Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines received from the AU had an expiration date of 13th April 2021.  The batch of Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines received from the COVAX Facility were to expire on 16th July 2021 – exactly one month after the notice was released. The World Health Organisation advises against using any vaccine that has passed its expiry date and recommends that expired doses are removed from the distribution chain and safely disposed of.  In May, the BBC reported that Malawi destroyed almost 20,000 doses of the AstraZeneca (AZ) vaccine. Other African countries have also not been able to use up all their vaccine doses before the expiry date. A more recent report by the BBC claims up to 450,000 vaccines have been destroyed in nine African countries including Sierra Leone.  Sierra Leone’s NaCOVERC has denied destroying expired vaccines saying 29,000 vaccine doses were administered from the AU batch which expired in April and 13,000 which expired before they could be used have not been administered nor destroyed but have been stored away.  The same statement released by NaCOVERC confirms that all 96,000 AstraZeneca vaccines supplied through the COVAX Facility were administered before their expiry date of 16th July 2021.  In a press conference organised by the country’s Information Ministry on 21st July 2021, Dr Tom Sesay stated “we could have paced the utilization of the AstraZeneca vaccines but because they were to expire on the 16th of July, we had to expedite the use of that particular vaccine”. This is not conclusive evidence to prove that the regulation for compulsory vaccination was imposed to amp up vaccine administration and beat the expiration date. However, it speaks to the pressure to use up the vaccines before they expire. “The call on citizens to be vaccinated is to break the chain between case surge and hospitalization and eventually attain herd immunity. Invariably, as people get inoculated, even our donors will have a very positive impression of SL as a worthy recipient of COVID-19 vaccines, and prioritize us for more supplies…because the 96,000 covax-donated AstraZeneca shelf life was considerably shorter than Sinopharm, we worked hard to exhaust that consignment before its July 16 expiration date and not to necessarily prioritize it over Sinopharm,” the Spokesperson for NaCOVERC, Solomon Jamiru, said when contacted for clarification. As at 20th July, 2021, a total of 135,590 people had received their first dose of COVID-19 vaccination and 32,607 people had received the second dose. This represents 2.7% of the population over 18 years targeted for vaccination. This data compared to the end of May shows over 86% increase in vaccine administration during the period the regulations were enforced. ConclusionWhile it is true that the Oxford-Astrazeneca vaccine doses received from the COVAX Facility were to expire on 16th July 2020 – one month after the NaCOVERC’s public notice, there is not sufficient evidence to show this was the reason for enforcing vaccination for employees of government ministries, departments and agencies. People were afraid of taking the vaccines because of the difference complications the hear about like deafness, nervous problem, lost of memories and so on Taking the second dose was the problem ",INSUFFICIENT-EVIDENCE,24/08/2021,https://dubawa.org/did-the-sierra-leone-government-enforce-vaccinations-to-beat-vaccine-expiry-date/
"Claim: Viral reports claimed home remedies such as insecticides, kerosene mixed with substances like camphor kill head lice.","Claim: Viral reports claimed home remedies such as insecticides, kerosene mixed with substances like camphor kill head lice.  There is no sufficient evidence that the home remedies mentioned could cure head lice but they are believed to be rather dangerous to human health.  Social media is awash with success stories of do-it-yourself remedies for head lice, a very dreaded disease common among females. Platforms such as YouTube are replete with videos showing how people reportedly got rid of lice using the various home remedies and urging the public to do the same. One of such is this user who applied kerosene to a louse placed in a basin. In the video, she proved that kerosene could kill the louse. Another user recently gave the same advice. Also, groups on Facebook, most especially those with titles such as ‘Do-it-yourself’ ‘Home Remedies’ among others, also are places where claims regarding hair lice are shared.  With over thousands of followers, the group members with such problems seek advice on how to get rid of hair lice and bring up age-long practices such as the application of insecticide to get rid of hair lice. Some also have recommended the use of Kerosene mixed with camphor as a head lice treatment as seen here, here and here.  Others have advised people with this challenge to make use of pain-relieving balm such as ‘Aboniki’ balm on the affected head because of the healing ability of the ointment.  This is despite stories of those who have been killed by these remedies, particularly a corps member in 2019 who applied Sniper insecticide to get rid of head lice in 2019. Also, in 2020, a young woman was advised by her hairdresser to apply the same insecticide on the scalp of her two daughters to get rid of hair lice. While one died, the other was saved after much effort by medical practitioners.  According to Medical News Today, head lice (singular louse) are tiny, wingless, parasitic insects that live in human hair. They are a common problem and highly contagious. They can also be hard to get rid of. The eggs are known as nits They live in the hair on one’s head and feed off the blood from the scalp.  While head lice move from person to person, there is insufficient evidence to prove that it can be transmitted via inanimate objects such as comb, pieces of clothing of the affected persons among others.  However, while it has been said that head lice do not pose a very serious medical threat, they may cause the carrier to be uncomfortable, causing severe itching.  It has also been emphasized that having head lice does not mean the carrier is dirty. “These pesky creatures don’t fly or jump — they crawl over to the closest head they can find. This is called head-to-head contact, and most people get lice this way. But they also can spread onto hats, helmets, combs, bedding…” Dubawa contacted Gogo James Owo, a clinical pathologist with De-Integrated Medical Diagnostics and Research Laboratories, Port Harcourt, Rivers State, who warned strictly against the use of kerosene/camphor, insecticide and other pesticides in getting rid of head lice. He said such home remedies are inimical to health. “I will advise that people stay away from using Sniper because the active ingredient in Sniper pesticide is Bifenthrin. It is a highly toxic organic pollutant. When bifenthrin gets on the skin, it can cause tingling, itching, burning, or numbness at the site of contact. The sensations usually go away within 48 hours.  “However, inhaling bifenthrin can irritate the nose, throat, and lungs and in severe cases, respiratory damage is observed,” he said. He also highlighted reasons why kerosene should never be applied to the scalp or any part of the body.  “Kerosene poisoning can cause symptoms in various parts of the body: it can cause breathing difficulty (from inhalation), it may cause throat swelling and the person may develop abdominal pain. “Exposure to kerosene can also cause a person to start stooling blood, develop low blood pressure, convulsions, coma, dizziness among others.” He suggested the use of Dimethicone, a highly effective head lice treatment lotion, with a low risk of adverse effects. “Two applications of dimethicone one week apart results in successful eradication of lice in at least 70% of patients. Dimethicone is not an insecticide. It kills lice by suffocation and disrupting their ability to regulate water,” Owo said. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention also listed pediculicides (lice medicine) as the treatment for head lice. It also stated that there are many head lice  “over-the-counter” medications.  It noted that over-the-counter products approved by the FDA for the treatment of head lice contain one of the following active ingredients: pyrethrins combined with piperonyl butoxide; permethrin lotion. Supplemental tips to be followed by people trying to get rid of lice infestations include: washing the hair with shampoo and using a nit comb; vacuuming furniture and floors, washing clothing worn or used by the infested person using hot water as lice and eggs are killed by exposure for 5 minutes to temperatures greater than 53.5°C (128.3°F). It also warned against fumigant sprays stating, “insecticide sprays are not recommended and can be harmful to people and animals”. The use of insecticide, kerosene for head lice removal can be dangerous. A person infested with head lice can consult a doctor if the over the counter remedies are not effective.

"Claim: A picture making the rounds on social media depicts a collapsed bridge alleged to be in Tatabu, in Niger State. Further, motorists were advised to avoid the road and use the Lokoja bypass instead.","Claim: A picture making the rounds on social media depicts a collapsed bridge alleged to be in Tatabu, in Niger State. Further, motorists were advised to avoid the road and use the Lokoja bypass instead.    Analysis conducted by DUBAWA reveals the picture of the said collapsed bridge was taken in 2017 when it collapsed but was soon after rebuilt and open for use in 2018. Thus this claim is false.  Full story Tatabu is a local community in Mokwa Local Government Area of Niger state and is  strategically located in that motorists and trains park to pass through to get to different parts of the country.  It’s a route that links the northern part of the country to the South and vice versa. The Tatabu bridge is positioned within a valley that cuts across the  rivers that serve the hydro stations in nearby Jebba. Sometimes in June 2017, the bridge collapsed, unleashing hell to those who had to pass through the area. Lives and properties were lost, rail tracks damaged, fishery and other activities in the nearby lake destabilized. Nonetheless, pictures making the rounds on different social media platforms now claim that the bridge has collapsed again.  The claim attracted reactions from a number of social media users.  Abraham Okpataku Agbons who commented on the claim on facebook, wrote; “How about the road that leads to Tatabu and all along.?” His inquiry suggests that he has condescended to the claim and as such, seeking other options.   Another user, Musa Muhamed gave a sarcastic reference to the Buhari Administration “God bless our PMB for his good deed.”  The acclaimed picture amassed interactions and several shares across board. One Tokunbo Aremo Odua posted on his facebook page the same claim and attracted over  263 interactions.  Although it got other reactions from a user, Romoke W. Ahmed, and four others who appeared to debunk the claim and implied that the incident happened two years ago. Their assertion was not enough to stop the claim  from spreading to different  groups on WhatsApp, such as the “QES set  of 90”, and that of Kwara Christians WhatsApp Group.  Infact, Legit, a renowned online media outlet released a news story with direct reference to the claim, headlined: “Breaking: Photos Emerge as Mokwa Jebba link bridge collapse,road users scamper for safety”.  This reality attracted DUBAWA’s interest to trace and track the reality in the claim.  DUBAWA first subjected the acclaimed picture to a Google reverse image search. Results from the query reveal the picture is indeed genuine but the incident, though actually happened in Tatabu, Niger State  took place back in 2017 and not in 2021 as claimed.  In fact, the alleged pictures shared were directly lifted from the ones shared back in 2017. Other results from the search show the 2017 incident was widely reported in the media and the bridge itself was repaired soon after its collapse in 2017.   Pictures of the Tatabu bridge shared on the official Facebook page of the Niger State Media. This was after it was repaired in 2018. Other findings show the Bridge has been a subject of reference to fake news since it collapsed in 2017. Back in 2019, Premium Times, Nigeria’s foremost investigative online newspaper, debunked a similar claim that alleged the collapse of the bridge in 2019, same also in 2018. DUBAWA reached out to Fatima Abdullahi Nasir, a resident and indigene of the Mokwa local government in Niger state. She confirmed that the bridge did not collapse and is in fact in good shape. “No, it’s not true. The bridge is okay and nothing has happened to it. My uncle passed there this morning and it’s still normal and functioning.” Fatima clarified.  The pictures of Tatabu bridge going viral that the same bridge has collapsed again is an old shot of the collapsed bridge in 2017. It is false,  and with wrong intent to mislead  motorists, railway travellers, the community, and Nigerians at large.

"Claim: Posts on social media are using the photos of a child whom they claim has kidney cancer, to solicit help from people.","The story of Miss Hubert Ikoi Nkanu came to the public after information about her condition was shared on the internet in 2018.  Born medically fit and sound, Hubert’s parents, who are based in Calabar, Cross River State, said they were worried when they noticed that her stomach was growing unusually bigger, sometime in 2017. “We observed that her stomach started growing big and she was also losing weight,” Nkanu Okoi, her father recalled.  “It made us very worried, so later we took her for a scan at Asi Ukpo Diagnostics to find out what was wrong.” Diagnosis after a Computed Tomography (CT) scan revealed that Hubert, aged 2 at the time, had Nephroblastoma with metastasis to the lungs. Also known as Wilms’ tumor, Nephroblastoma is a rare kidney cancer that primarily affects children aged 2 to 5. It occurs mostly in one kidney, but can sometimes be found in both kidneys at the same time. “We did not have money for her medical care and she was going through lots of pain, so we started looking for help,” Nkanu said. The family made videos and pictures of the ailing child and the medical report, which were circulated on news websites and social media, soliciting donations from members of the public. Donations were requested to be made to the Sterling Bank Account of Vital Signs with Account Number 0065009571. Hubert has since recovered after surgery and other medical treatments. Her father said “she now attends school and is doing well.” But in 2021, pictures and videos of Hubert before her treatment resurfaced on the internet, but with a different name and a different bank account details, in posts seeking financial donations for her surgery and medical treatments. The posts have been widely shared between May and August by many social media users, bloggers and influencers, including ex-Big Brother Nigeria housemate, Ike Onyema. Dubawa found that the recently circulated posts seeking help with the girl’s photos are scams. In an interview with Dubawa, Nkanu Okoi, father of the girl in all the photos, revealed that his daughter’s real name is Hubert Okoi Nkanu. This implies that all the posts using the girl’s photos and/or videos with different names, such as “Beatrice or Beatrice Alimi”, are fake.  Mr. Nkanu also said that the posts did not emanate from him or his family, adding that the bank account details attached to the posts (Wema Bank, Fidelis Alimi Agbahi, 7810604013), are scams, which suggest a ploy to defraud unsuspecting members of the public. He confirmed that his daughter was diagnosed with Nephroblastoma in 2018, after they took her for a scan, due to an unusual swelling of her stomach. “We spent all our money, borrowed money, and even had to sell my shares in Zenith bank to get money, but it was not enough,” he said. He said they found hope when they met the CEO of Vital Signs and Ayade Care Home Health Services, Calabar, Dr. Genevive Barnaby, who advised and assisted them to reach out to the public, to help raise the money needed for their daughter’s treatment. They made videos and uploaded pictures of the girl and the medical report, which were shared on social media to solicit for donations. She was referred to the University of Calabar Teaching Hospital, where doctors prescribed surgery and 21 weeks of chemotherapy, which was pegged at Nine Hundred Thousand Naira (N900,000). Although a total sum of N800,000 was donated, Mr. Nkanu said Dr. Barnaby only remitted N75,000 to the family.  He said his daughter’s case got the attention of the doctors at the UCTH Doctors’ Welfare unit, who facilitated her treatment, surgery and chemotherapy, free of charge. He confirmed that Hubert recovered after the surgery and had since started school. “We spent 6 months at UCTH for the surgery and treatment, after which my daughter recovered. This happened  3 years ago. She has been attending school. I was surprised when I saw those old photos and videos online again with posts asking for money,” he said. “My daughter’s name is Hubert Okoi Nkanu and not Beatrice Alimi. It is a scam.” Hale and Hearty: A recent photo of Hubert Okoi Nkanu Edu Ele, a social worker who is close to the Nkanu family, said the scam had received wide attention due to the large followership of celebrities and influencers who had shared the posts. “With their posts on those celebrities’ pages, it’s spreading like wildfire,” she said. She has engaged a campaign on twitter and instagram to draw attention of the public to the scam, and has tried to get celebrities and influencers to take down the posts. Dubawa found many burner accounts, including one in the fake name “Beatrice Alimi”, which are involved in perpetuating the scam. While some made the posts, others were in comment sections, cajoling people to make donations. Screenshot of comments section showing one of the fake accounts cajoling users for donations One of the posters even claimed to be the little girl Beatrice Alimi’s uncle and the person who has been taking care of her since she was diagnosed with the illness – a claim that Dubawa has confirmed to be false. Dubawa has found that the real name of the girl in the photos circulated on social media is Hubert Okoi Nkanu. Every post carrying the same photo but identifying her with a different name is fake. It was also discovered that the girl in the photos, Hubert, was diagnosed with nephroblastoma 3 years ago, but has since recovered and is now in good health.

"Claim: Former presidential aide, Reno Omokri, claimed the federal government used $593 million to purchase twelve Tucano fighter jets.","Claim: Former presidential aide, Reno Omokri, claimed the federal government used $593 million to purchase twelve Tucano fighter jets. The federal government’s purchase of 12 Tucano jets from the United States in a solidified effort against Boko Haram terrorism and banditry did not come at the price of $593m. A former presidential aide and UK-based Nigerian preacher, Reno Omokri, in a Facebook post on August 16, claimed that “Nigeria bought 12 Super Tucano jets from the US for $593 million.” Reno made this claim in the wake of the political crisis currently bedevilling Afghanistan, a mountainous landlocked country at the crossroads of Central and South Asia. He feared the Tucano super jets obtained by Nigeria in the fight against insurgency and other sundry crimes may be hijacked if the federal government continues its romance with weapon-wielding terrorists in northeast Nigeria. Omokri also warned against the rehabilitation of repentant terrorists under the program codenamed “Operation Safe Corridor,” arguing that Nigeria must “learn her lessons before it is too late.” Nigeria bought 12 Super Tucano jets from the US for $593 million. The Taliban got them for free by defeating the US and the Afghan government. With the way Buhari romances Boko Haram, I just pray Nigeria’s 12 Super Tucano jets will not become their property one day! Because what is happening in Nigeria today first happened in Afghanistan.  The rehabilitation of so-called repentant Taliban by the US and Afghan government allowed them to act first as spies, then as enemies within, which was a chief causative factor in the rapid victory of the Taliban. May Nigeria learn her lessons before it is too late! the Facebook post read. After 20 years of its coalition and presence in Afghanistan with trillions spent in reinforcing the Afghan military operation against the Taliban, the United States withdrew its troops and embassy from the country on Sunday, August 15. This followed the directive given by President Joe Biden who has been arguing that it is high time the Afghanistan troops faced the reality of their country. The Taliban declared victory after Afghan president, Ashraf Ghani, fled and his government collapsed amid heightened Taliban invasion. Kabul, the last major city in Afghanistan, fell to a Taliban offensive that began months ago but accelerated in recent days as the conservative Islamists gained control of more territories. The city has since become a scene of chaos, with heart-wrenching pictures and videos of Afghans trying to escape the Taliban draconian rule as they struggled to board a US military cargo plane leaving Kabul for Qatar flooding the social media. Hundreds of Afghans were packed into a US Air Force cargo plane leaving Kabul with 640 people reported to be on board. Defending his position in a national address on August 10, President Biden argued that the US troops withdrawal was necessitated because “our mission in Afghanistan was never supposed to have been nation-building.” Boko Haram, officially known as Jamā’at Ahl as-Sunnah lid-Da’wah wa’l-Jihād,  began as a dissenting voice in Borno State with the aim of “purifying” and overtaking the Nigerian government like the Taliban in Afghanistan. Founded in 2002 by its late founder Ustaz Mohammed Yusuf, the history of the Nigerian/African jihadist movement supersedes what has been written so far because a lot of its atrocities in Nigeria and Lake Chad Basin were left unreported. It would be recalled that after Yusuf’s controversial death in 2009, his vicegerent Abubakar Shekau took over and his reign ended in 2021 after being overpowered by a rival militant group ISWAP.   Shekau’s reign was characterised by terrors in manifolds, with Boko Haram being already responsible for the death of tens of thousands of people in frequent attacks against the police, armed forces and civilians.  The dreaded insurgent group has displaced over 2.3 million from their homes and contributed to regional food crises and abductions including Chibok Girls (Borno) and Dapchi Girls (Yobe) As a result of its atrocities, Nigeria was ranked number 3 in the 2020 Global Terrorism Index behind Afghanistan and Iran.  Although the Nigerian government ordered the purchase of twelve Tucano super fighter jets from the United States in an intensified effort against the onslaught of the Boko Haram insurgent group, findings revealed that the fighter jets do not come at the price of $593 million as claimed by Mr Omokri. Here is the background: The idea to purchase 12 Tucano jets was strongly conceived in 2018 by the federal government under retired Air Marshal Sadique B. Abubakar when he was the country’s Chief of Air Staff (COAS). Speaking with journalists on Sunday, January 28, 2019, retired Air Marshal S. B. Abubakar said the President Muhammadu Buhari-led government had “released funds for the purchase of 12 Super Tucano aircraft from the Government of the United States of America, while another 5 attack/utility helicopters have been ordered from Italy.” The former chief of air staff also disclosed that “a total of 200 personnel have been receiving training in nine different countries of the world on handling combat aircraft.” In July 2021, the Nigeria Airforce (NAF) said it had received the first batch of six A-29 Super Tucano aircraft from the United States. The fighter jets, according to the NAF director of public relations and information for Edward Gabkwet, landed in Kano State where they were received by Minister of Defence Bashir Magashi, the Chief of Army Staff (COAS), Faruk Yahaya and Chief of Air Staff (COAS) Oladayo Amao. Security experts submitted that the arrival of the super fighter jets would be a game-changer in the fight against insurgency in the country, especially in the northeast. Findings by Dubawa established that the fighter jets were purchased at the price of $469.4million. According to Premium Times and International Centre for Investigative Reporting (ICIR),  the money was transferred to the US government in 2018. This clearly contradicts the $593 million figure given by Mr Omokri. President Buhari had in a letter to the National Assembly (NASS) disclosed that the sum of $496million was withdrawn from the Excess Crude Account (ECA) for the purchase of military aircraft. Worth mentioning is that the deliberation over the purchase of new super jets was partly responsible for the delay in the passage of the 2018 budget. Reno Omokri was indeed right that the federal government purchased twelve Tucano super fighter jets to combat insurgency in the northeast. But his claim that $593 million was spent on the jets is wrong and misleading.

"Claim: Photos of a 10-year old girl who gave birth to a girl child have been trending on Facebook, with many claiming that the incident occurred in Lofa County, Liberia.","Claim: Photos of a 10-year old girl who gave birth to a girl child have been trending on Facebook, with many claiming that the incident occurred in Lofa County, Liberia. The county health officer of Lofa County, Dr. John S. Doedeh, has denied the claim. Further research shows the incident occurred in Nigeria where the 10-year old, who was raped, got pregnant and gave birth through caesarean section. The claim which was posted on Facebook on August 7, 2021 by a social media platform ONE Liberia states “Breaking News! Monrovia- A 10 years old girl successfully delivered a bouncing baby girl 2.5kg in a local hospital located in Lofa county today.” When contacted, the county health officer of Lofa County, Dr. John S. Doedeh, said the claim is untrue. “Information about the 10-year old girl giving birth at a hospital in Lofa is absolutely not true,” Dr. Doedeh said in a text message.  Speaking via phone, the administrator of the biggest government referral hospital in Lofa County, the Tellewoyon Memorial Hospital, Albert Cooler, said they have not received such cases at the hospital. “Though there are minors who give birth, however, a 10-year old girl giving birth at the hospital is false.”  Also a health practitioner who works with the reproductive and maternal mortality unit at the Ministry of Health in Liberia, madam Younger Mulbah Pewee stated that there is no such case that involves a 10-year old girl giving birth at any of the hospitals in the country. In an effort to further verify the facts, our research showed that the incident occurred on August 4, 2019 and that the 10-year old girl actually gave birth to a girl child. It also unveiled  that  the story was  published on August 7, 2019 by a Nigerian Organization based in Abuja, the Premium Times , which revealed that the  10-year old girl was allegedly raped in Benue State, Nigeria by an 18-year old man named Terna Tega who got her pregnant.   A media company in Abuja, Daily Trust, published the story in 2019, quoting an activist, Ukan Kurugh, who through his advocacy was able to transfer the minor from the Foundation Hospital in Makurdi. Ukan Kurugh is quoted as saying “the girl was given a Caesarean section to deliver a baby girl weighing 2.5kg. Pulseng.com also published the story in August 2019. The story was also posted in 2019 on Twitter by other social media outlets. From our research, the incident circulating on social media of a 10-year old giving birth to a girl child occurred in Nigeria in 2019 and not in Lofa County, Liberia as claimed by Facebook posts.

Claim: Drinking okra water first thing in the morning treats diabetes.,"On August 1, 2021, a Facebook user Aramide health tips posted a claim that “drinking okra water first thing in the morning treated diabetes”. In the post, it was claimed that okra contains insulin-like properties, which are beneficial for the treatment of diabetes. Okra water helps to reduce the sugar level in the blood.  Meanwhile, some people have suggested that drinking okra water helps lessen diabetes symptoms. The drink is made by putting okra pods in water and soaking them overnight. Some of the valuable nutrients in the skin and seed pods will be absorbed by the water. What is Okra? Okra (Abelmoschus esculentus Hibiscus esculentus Linn) known by some as lady’s fingers or gumbo is a flowering plant in the mallow family. It is an annual herb that is widely cultivated for its edible green seed pods in tropical, subtropical and warm temperate climates. Okra is also a good source of minerals, vitamins, antioxidants and fiber; it contains a sticky juice that people use to thicken sauces. It is an essential crop in many countries due to its high nutritional value. Also, people can use many parts of the plant including the fresh leaves, buds, flowers, pods, stems and seeds. Nutritional Components of Okra According to the U.S department of Agriculture (USDA) National Nutrient Database, one cup of raw okra, weighing 100 grams (g) contains: 33 calories 1.9 grams of protein 0.2 grams of fat 7.5 grams of carbohydrates 3.2 grams of fiber 1.5 grams of sugar 31.3 milligrams (mg) of vitamin K 299 milligrams of potassium 7 milligrams of sodium 23 milligrams of vitamin C 0.2 milligrams of thiamin 57 milligrams of magnesium 82 milligrams of calcium 0.215 milligrams of vitamin B6 60 micrograms (mcg) of folate 36 micrograms of vitamin A Okra also provides some iron, niacin, phosphorus and copper.  Generally, Okra is a high-value crop because it represents a source of nutrients that are important to human health, e.g., vitamins, potassium, calcium and unsaturated fatty acids such as (inolenic and oleic acids) among others. However, evidence of okra having anti-diabetic properties has increased in recent years with multiple vito (laboratory) and vivo (animal) studies confirming okra as a potent blood glucose-lowering (or anti diabetic) food. And one of such is a Facebook post by Aramide health tips claiming  that “drinking okra water first thing in the morning treats diabetes”. According to the  World Health Organization (WHO), diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs either when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces and insulin is a hormone that regulates blood sugar. The various types of diabetes include: type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, gestational diabetes, monogenic diabetes and cystic fibrosis related diabetes. Over time, having too much glucose in one’s blood can cause serious problems. It can damage the eyes, kidneys and nerves. Diabetes can also cause heart disease, stroke and even the need to remove a limb. It should be of note that various studies have been done on the effectiveness of okra in treating diabetes, but only on animals and there are no conclusive research of its impact on humans. A Nutritionist, Tolu Arowolo, said it is a well known fact that okra has good nutritional value as a vegetable, but nothing has been ascertained yet about its insulin-like properties. She said, “Although, I have heard the claim that drinking okra water in the morning treats diabetes, what nutritionists are aware of is that it is a good vegetable with high nutritional value.”  A medical practitioner, Dr. Ademola Ayodele, said the claim that diabetes can be treated by drinking okra in the morning is medically not feasible. According to him, “Medically, such a claim is not only doubtful but can be easily argued against. First, we need to understand what causes diabetes, it is said to be a relative or absolute lack of insulin. Now, okra is not going to reduce insulin, so how will it treat diabetes?” “Perhaps, if explored further, there may be some benefits in terms of managing the complications, but the main treatment for now remains, either the production or supplement of insulin or to have a drug that will make the insulin which is in the body to be more effective. So, that claim can never be approved by any medical practitioner.” A Consultant Endocrinologist with the University of Science Teaching Hospital, Ondo (UNIMED), Dr Adenike Enikuomehin, said the claim that drinking okra water in the morning treats diabetes is false as it is yet to be scientifically proven. She said, “No, if you take green okra, it is good for you as a vegetable, but it does not treat or cure diabetes and that’s why we have so many complications of diabetes coming to us in the hospitals. Because, they would follow things they see online and later this leads to complications.”  “And so, there is nothing like that, scientifically that claim is yet to be proven and there is nothing like such medically. I will advise that people don’t do this, so as to avoid presenting themselves in the hospitals with eye, kidney and heart complications among others. The claim that drinking okra water treats diabetes is false.”  The claim that drinking okra water first thing in the morning treats diabetes is misleading as it is yet to be proven medically and scientifically that okra has properties that can be used to treat diabetes.

Claim: A picture appeared recently on both WhatsApp and Facebook claiming that American Doctors Association gave out a warning that eating food in plastic causes 52 types of cancer.,"Claim: A picture appeared recently on both WhatsApp and Facebook claiming that American Doctors Association gave out a warning that eating food in plastic causes 52 types of cancer. There is insufficient evidence to substantiate this claim, even though some researchers believe that plastic, especially when heated, may be injurious to human health. Recently, a picture went viral on social media, including on WhatsApp and Facebook, containing claims that eating hot food, drinking tea in plastic cups, and microwaving foodstuff in plastic bags will cause cancer. The image on social media contained a message attributing a claim to the American Doctors Association and linked plastic to 52 types of cancer. It also contained warnings and advised the message be shared to others. Alongside warnings, the message had a list of a few of the causes of cancer by the American Doctors Association. In the first instance, a search by the researcher shows that the image is not a new one, it has merely been re-circulated recently repeatedly. It appeared on Nairaland in 2016, and many other places including Facebook. This researcher combed the internet to confirm whether the image, and its content truly emanated from the source to which it was attributed, the American Doctors association. The Association of American Doctors has a dormant Facebook account. According to information on its Facebook account, it was created on 29 March 2015, it has 581 followers, but its last activity (a self-generated content) is a profile picture posted on December 22, 2016. The search on Google did not yield any organization by the name, giving the hint that it does not exist. Rather, what is available includes Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, and American Medical Association, but no American Doctors Association. In other words, the source or authority to which the cancer claim was attributed is non-existent, and therefore fake.  Various studies say there is no single cause of cancer. Many scientists or groups, like Stanford HealthCare, maintain that it is the interaction or aggregation of many factors that produces cancer. In some broad forms, they say that the factors may include genetic, environmental, or constitutional characteristics of the individual. But they list some of the cancer risk factors to include, lifestyle (such as smoking, high-fat diet, working with toxic chemicals); family history (inheritance, genetics); some genetic disorders, exposure to certain viruses and environmental stimuli. They believe also that some forms of exposure to chemotherapy and radiation can predispose to cancer. In 2019, the Cancer Research Institute stated that a number of behavioral factors can lead to genetic mutations and, as a result, lead to the development of cancer. Such behavioral factors include, tobacco, tanning (excessive exposure to ultraviolet light), diet (red and processed meats), alcohol, unsafe sex (leading to viral infection) and inflammatory conditions such as ulcerative colitis or obesity. In addition, the substances referred to as carcinogens have been reported to be implicated in cancer. They include chemical carcinogen exposure, hormonal drugs, immune-suppressing drugs taken by transplant recipients, and radioactive materials. Some studies have found that certain chemicals are released from plastic into our food and beverages, and have been linked to some metabolic disorders including obesity and reduced fertility. When heat is involved, the release of the chemicals can be faster especially when using the microwave, but other experts insist no sufficient research has been carried out to make this claim evident; ‘so far there’s no research that answers how much amount actually gets into our body’. However, some studies strongly believe that at certain exposure levels, some of the chemicals in plastic beverage containers, some disposable plates, and toiletry bottles, such as bisphenol A (BPA) may cause cancer in people. BPA is a weak synthetic estrogen found in many rigid plastic products, food and formula can linings, dental sealants, and on the shiny side of paper cashier receipts (to stabilize the ink). They insist, however, that if you must use plastic, they must be plastic with recycling symbol 2, 4, and 5 which with recycling symbol 7 are safe, as long as they also have a leaf symbol on them. Researchers conclude that even though some studies have found certain chemicals in plastics can end up in things we eat and drink, the levels are low and within considerable range safe for humans. They insist that there is no good evidence that people can get cancer from using plastics. ‘So, doing things like drinking from plastic bottles or using plastic containers and food bags won’t increase your risk of cancer’, they insist. ‘No controlled study has been done to show that plastic can cause cancer. But some observational studies have found that it does have harmful chemicals.” According to Cancer Research UK, even if a little quantity of chemical enters the food, their probability of being dangerous is very low. And, of a truth, that using plastic in microwaving food causes cancer has basically been enlisted as a ‘rumor’ circulating about the disease. It is almost a consensus that no research has been able to establish that plastic causes cancer. In fact, this is the submission of Dr Jimoh Mutiu a clinical oncologist, at the University College Hospital, Ibadan, who told this researcher that there is no scientific basis in any part of the world to show that eating food in plastic causes cancer.  He said, “We work with evidence. The only thing that has been proven is processed food or smoked food that are carcinogens. Even in smoked food, we always advise cancer patients to eat smoked food in moderation. Smoking has been proven to be a risk factor for the majority of cancer, same as alcohol. [But] there is no scientific proof to support eating in plastic.” While responding to claims that making moin moin (Nigerian steamed bean pudding) in nylon could cause cancer, he stated that this is also within the realm of speculation. For him, ‘all these things need to be based on evidence. People can just assume anything. If there is no scientific background, science will not agree with it.’ He concluded that even if any study is carried out, the average result of the study will still be insufficient to generalise that it is universal. While there is evidence that plastic contains a measure of chemicals that scientists say are injurious to human health when used in packaging or processing food and drinks, there is a strong belief that plastic cannot be sufficiently and exclusively linked to cancer. Thus, there is insufficient evidence to substantiate this claim that eating hot food, drinking tea in plastic cups, and microwaving food in plastic bags will cause cancer.

Claim: Boy’s skin peeling off after he was bitten by insect,"Claim: Boy’s skin peeling off after he was bitten by insect  There is no evidence the child in the graphic photo was stung by a centipede  A picture making the rounds recently on WhatsApp shows a small child lying on his side with cracked skin over half of the body, with an accompanying text that reads “This boy’s skin has been peeling off since he was bitten by this insect.  “Doctors said they don’t have any treatment for its venom because it has Not been discovered by scientists,” it continues. It then asks users to share the graphic and “pray for this dying child,” it added.  An inset photo showing what looks like a centipede was added to the picture. Dubawa began its search by doing a google reverse image on the picture. The search returned a Facebook post on the wall of Shatta Wale Fans WorldWide, made on July 18, 2018 with the picture and the same message.  Screenshot of the picture when it first surfaced online  The claim was also repeated on Nairaland Forum, a Nigerian discussion forum on the same date in 2018.  Screenshot of the post on Nairaland  However, two specialists told Dubawa that the child’s skin disorder could not have been as a result of a centipede bite.  Dr Shola David Ola-Fadunsi, a senior lecturer at the department of veterinary parasitology at the University of Ilorin, said there is no documented evidence of a centipede causing such type of lesion on the skin.  Dr Ahmad Ibrahim Mustapha, a veterinary doctor, said he could not conclusively say the child’s condition was a result of the centipede bite.  He, however, stated that while centipedes might be venomous they only produce few effects, which cannot be as much as what is shown in the picture.  He added that from the look of the boy’s skin in the picture suggests an extensive lesion which looks more like a fungal growth leathery in appearance. Further findings on a UK based Health Newsletter, Medical News Today in one of its articles, discussed extensively possible symptoms and treatments of a centipede bite, as well as the resultant appearance of a person who receives one.  It added that Centipede stings can be painful but rarely cause health complications in people, and aren’t dangerous. The sting can be identified by swelling and redness.  Centipedes are carnivorous and venomous. They sting and eat their prey, which typically consists of insects and worms. They’re not aggressive towards humans, but may bite humans that provoke them.  Although people use the term “bite,” a centipede does not actually use their mouthparts to damage the skin. When a centipede feels threatened, it will pierce the skin of its prey with the pincer-like tips of the legs closest to the head, which are called forcipules.  The bite looks like two red marks on the skin, which form a V-shape due to the positioning of the forcipules of the centipede.  Screenshot of centipede bite on the hand   Screenshot of bite on the leg Centipede bites can be very painful to people. The larger the centipede, the more painful its bite may be. All centipedes use venom to kill their prey. Centipede bites rarely cause health complications in humans, and aren’t typically dangerous or fatal. People rarely report any serious symptoms from a centipede bite.  Some possible effects of a centipede bite include: localized pain, swelling and redness, bleeding, itchiness or burning, numbness, tingling, and tenderness, hardening of the skin, throbbing red streaks on the skin, localized infection, tissue death, swelling of the lymph nodes etc  The UK Health News Letter stated that in extremely rare cases there have been reports of more severe symptoms, such as: Lack of oxygen to the heart muscle, heart attack, blood in the urine, hemoglobin in the urine rhabdomyolysis, which is the break down of damaged skeletal muscle tissue, excessive bleeding and skin infections.  According to the article some people may experience an allergic reaction to a centipede bite. Researchers in Thailand described a situation in which a 23-year-old man experienced anaphylactic shock (a severe allergic reaction) after a centipede bit him.  An allergic reaction may occur within minutes of receiving a bite. Some of the symptoms of a severe reaction include: facial swelling, generalized hives and rash on the skin, chest discomfort, loss of consciousness or responsiveness, severely low blood pressure, called hypotension.  When centipedes bite a person, they inject venom into the skin. The production of the venom takes place in a gland in the forcipule. Centipedes inject venom into their prey to protect and defend themselves. Sometimes, the centipede may feel threatened by a human. Researchers have isolated more than 500 components of centipede venom, but they have only described a few of these.  Some of the components include chemicals that occur naturally in the brain, such as serotonin and histamine. Researchers note that these chemicals do not typically cause neurological effects in humans.  The article stated that rarely, some people may report the following neurological symptoms from a centipede bite: headaches, anxiety, and dizziness.  It added that a few people have reported euphoric feelings, psychological effects, and memory disturbances following a centipede bite.  It revealed that people may feel anxious when a centipede bites them, due to both the pain of the bite and the appearance of the multi-legged creature. However, in most cases, a person will not need to seek medical attention because a centipede bite is rarely serious.  If a person does see a doctor, the doctor may suggest using treatments to soothe the pain, itchiness, and swelling of the skin. However, the symptoms tend to resolve on their own within a few hours or a few days at most.  Some people may need a pain reliever, such as acetaminophen, or an anti-inflammatory, such as ibuprofen. Cortisone cream and antihistamines can also reduce symptoms of allergies.  If a person experiences a severe allergic reaction to a centipede bite, such as an anaphylactic shock, such a person needs immediate medical attention. People with centipede bites may experience local reactions in the affected area, but the symptoms will typically resolve within a few hours to a few days.  In some situations, underlying diseases may affect the outlook of a person with a centipede bite. For example, people with diabetes may experience more severe skin reactions and infections following a centipede bite.  In cases of anaphylactic shock, clinical signs are likely to improve without long-term consequences if a person receives prompt treatment. Doctors may prescribe an epinephrine auto-injector and suggest avoiding centipedes.  Explanations provided by medical experts show that it is unlikely the extensive lesion on the child’s skin in the picture was caused by a centipede bite. There is, however. insufficient evidence to prove or disprove the claim.

"Claim: a recent Facebook post, Dapo Abiodun, the Governor of Ogun State, claimed Emeritus Professor Theophilus Ogunlesi is the first professor of medicine in Nigeria.","Claim: a recent Facebook post, Dapo Abiodun, the Governor of Ogun State, claimed Emeritus Professor Theophilus Ogunlesi is the first professor of medicine in Nigeria. True, Professor Theophilus Ogunlesi is the first professor of medicine in Nigeria. In a Facebook post dated Monday, July 12, Governor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun state claimed that Emeritu  s Professor Theophilus Ogunlesi is Nigeria’s first Professor of Medicine. The governor made this claim in a tribute to Ogunlesi on the occasion of the celebration of his 98th birthday. Governor Abiodun, while showering a flurry of encomiums on the nonagenarian claimed that Ogunlesi “has set Ogun State on the global map, where other states envy.” He further added that Ogunlesi set up “principles that impact society positively.” “I felicitate  with Emeritus Professor Theophilus Ogunlesi on his 98th birthday. Professor Ogunlesi deserves to be celebrated today, not just for enjoying the rare grace of clocking the age but for living a life dedicated to setting up principles that impact society positively. “Amongst others, Prof’s status as Nigeria’s first Professor of Medicine has set Ogun State on the global map, where other states envy. “I am delighted to wish Professor Ogunlesi a memorable birth anniversary, with prayers of renewed strength,” the full text read. Without any iota of doubt, Emeritus Theophilus Ogunlesi has put his feet on the sands of time in the field of medicine as a pedagogue in the Nigerian academic space spanning decades as a mentor and medical practitioner. Born on July  12, 1923, the nonagenarian is one of the leading lights of Nigerian education.  Ogunlesi’s status as a stellar star of Nigeria’s golden generation was shown in President Muhammadu Buhari’s heartfelt tribute to him on his 98th birthday where he was described as a man who “had spearheaded the training of generations of Nigerians, many of whom became vice-chancellors of universities, ministers of health, and distinguished medical professionals in Nigeria and across the globe.” However, a finding by Dubawa shows that Ogunlesi is not the only Nigerian to be called the first professor of medicine in Nigeria as another Emeritus professor, late Oladipo Olujimi Akinkugbe, was widely referred to as the first Nigerian to reach the pinnacle of academic rank in medical studies. For instance, in its publication of July 15, 2020 announcing Akinkugbe’s demise, Vanguard newspaper described the late physician as “the first Professor of Medicine.” The Nigerian Tribune of the same day also described Akinkugbe as Nigeria’s first medicine professor while Legit.ng also described the late physician as the pioneering professor of medicine in Nigeria. In its own report, The Guardian also announced Akinkugbe as the first professor of medicine. Often referred to as ‘Prof’ or ‘Baba’ (father), Akinkungbe (DPhil, FRCP, CON, CFR, FAS) who died on Monday, July 15, 2020, was a distinguished professor of medicine at the University of Ibadan. He, according to the Royal College of Physicians, was a pioneer in the speciality of hypertension and nephrology in Nigeria and across Africa. His citation on the University of Ibadan (UI)’s website reads that he was a professor at 35 and became dean of the faculty of medicine at the University of Ibadan at 37. His university undergraduate education began at University College, Ibadan and was completed, as was the practice then, at the London University where he took his medical degree in 1958… His academic career at Ibadan had started in 1965. He had a meteoric rise and was promoted to Professor of Medicine in 1968 at the age of 35. He served as the Dean of Medicine from 1970-1974 and Head, Department of Medicine briefly in 1972.  He had the distinction of having been one of the few, not just in Nigeria but in the whole of academia, to have concurrently held the positions of Head of Medicine, Dean of Medicine and Acting Vice-Chancellor at some time, the citation read. In a citation by Kidney International, Akinkugbe was hailed for “pioneering work in the speciality of hypertension and nephrology, not only in Nigeria … but also across Africa.’’ According to GCI Museum, an organisation archiving relevant information (written, audio & visual docs) about the School, Old Boys, Akinkugbe was referred to as “the foremost  professor of medicine to be appointed by an African university.’’ He was said to have contributed to the medical literature, having written over 100 journals and served as the editor of numerous journals.  Despite his enviable erudition, Dubawa’s findings show that late Emeritus Professor Akinkungbe was not the first professor of medicine in Nigeria but  Theophilus Ogunlesi. Born in Sagamu in Ogun State on July 12, 1923, to a blacksmith, Ogunlesi went to St Paul Primary School in Sagamu between 1931-35 and proceeded to CMS Grammar School in Lagos between 1936-40. He went to Higher College in Yaba between 1941-42. According to Sagamu Club, a socio-cultural group in Ogun State, he was inspired for the medical profession by R.L Oluwole, a son of bishop Oluwole, who recommended him for a scholarship after his program at the Yaba Higher College in 1942. Ogunlesi started on the path of the medical profession in 1947 through the Yaba Medical School. And in the quest to improve his medical qualification obtained in Nigeria, he went to the University of London in 1953 and subsequently qualified as a medical officer in Britain registered in England. The nonagenarian physician was conferred a medicine professorship by the University of Ibadan in 1965 four years after joining the institution’s department of medicine. He took after pioneer professor Alexander Brown and three others who were from Britain when Ibadan was to host an annex of the University College of London in 1948.  Ogunlesi’s ascension to the status of professorship followed his enviable career from an assistant medical officer at the Nigeria Medical Department between (1947-48) and a medical officer of the Western Nigeria Civil Service (WNC) between 1950-56. He retired in 1983 at the age of 60 from lecturing. Meanwhile, according to the official University of Ibadan (UI) website Akinkugbe became professor of medicine in 1968 at the age of 35 after a meteoric rise in lecturing –three years after Ogunlesi was conferred a medicine professorship. In an interview with The Sun newspaper dated January 18, 2017, Professor Ogunlesi narrated his journey as Nigeria’s first professor of medicine.  I became a professor at the University of Ibadan in  1965. I joined the university in 1961 and I became a professor 4 years later and the year I became a senior lecturer and that was because I was already a specialist in the civil service.  I joined at a time when Ibadan (UI) ran mostly by expatriate teachers. So, I was one of the first Nigerian lecturers in Medicine. That’s why I became the first Nigerian Professor of Medicine at the University of Ibadan,” he said. Both Professors Ogunlesi and Akinkugbe tower high in the history of academics in Nigeria in respect to medical studies. They trained the first generations of medical doctors in the country including the former minister of health, Professor Isaac Adewole. However, records show that Ogunlesi is the first professor of medicine in Nigeria contrary to the claims backing Akinkugbe Abiodun.

Claim: Sucking a pregnant woman’s breast prepares her for breastfeeding after delivery.,"On August 5, 2021, a Chief Nursing Sister, Roseline Oladimeji, advised pregnant women to allow their husbands to suck their breasts to prepare them for breastfeeding after delivery. She said, “Allow your husbands to suck your breasts during pregnancy. Apart from bonding, it will help the nipples to be out and make it easier for your baby to latch on. ‘You can also rub Vaseline on your nipples at night before going to sleep. It also helps to soften it (the breasts)’. the nursing sister added. She urged pregnant women to prepare their breasts during pregnancy to avoid lactation problems after delivery. Breastfeeding is when a mother feeds her baby breast milk, usually directly from the breast, and it is also called nursing. Breast milk has been said to provide an infant with essential calories, vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients for optimal growth, health and development. Breastfeeding is beneficial to both a mother and her infant and also offers an important opportunity for the pair to bond. According to the World Health Organization, WHO breast milk contains all the nutrients an infant needs in the first six months of life. And, while some infants born at term can breastfeed directly following birth, some term infants and many preterm infants may not be able to do so for various reasons and thus require feeding by alternative methods. These methods may include cups, spoons, syringes, parental feeding tubes or feeding bottles or treats. However, the inability to breastfeed directly may be only temporary or permanent depending on the reasons behind it. One of such reasons is because breastfeeding hurts. Pain while breastfeeding is usually down to sore, tender nipples, especially once the milk ‘comes in’ around two or four days after giving birth. With the baby feeding every couple of hours, it means the problem can worsen quickly with some mothers finding their nipples crack, bleed, or become blistered. So, does sucking a pregnant woman’s breast really prepare her for breastfeeding after delivery? The Chief Medical Director, Mother and Child Hospital Akure, Dr Banke Oluwafemi, said it is true sucking a pregnant woman’s breast helps breastfeeding after delivery but it is not applicable and suitable to all pregnant women. she said “it is true because it will help the nipples to shoot out. and the alternative is that when the woman is having her bath, she uses her hand to pull out the nipples. But there are some women that can not stand that stage of pregnancy. But it is also good to find solutions to whatever issues that could arise, so that there won’t be frustration between the mother and the baby in terms of breastfeeding subsequently.” “For women with retracted nipples, there are existing methods we use in the hospital like syringes. It is true but not all pregnant women can tolerate this, because she could get stimulated which could lead to an irritable uterus and she could start contracting which is not a palatable condition and that is why such a method is only feasible for women who can tolerate it.” she added. A Consultant Pediatrician with the University of Medical Science Teaching Hospital, Ondo, UNIMEDTH, Dr. Olasehinde Bello, said it is medically correct that sucking a pregnant woman’s breast helps breastfeeding after delivery but the society does not encourage it. He said, “it is true to a large extent but because of the peculiarities of our environment such things have really not been spoken off. However, the most important thing is for the areola to get stimulated and other methods come into play here. But it is good to note that breast pumps are not good stimulants and as such we advocate that the woman uses her fingers to stimulate the areolas.” He also added that the baby also stimulates the breast after delivery by sucking it because the more the baby sucks, the more the mother lactates (produces milk). This position is also supported by the World Health Organization WHO, which reveals that infants should be put to the mother’s breast shortly after birth to keep skin to skin contact when they have the strongest instinct to suckle the mother’s nipples. Other studies also show that to stimulate the nipples and remove milk from the breast, while ensuring an adequate supply and a good flow of milk, a baby needs to be well attached so that a baby can suckle effectively. Difficulties are said to occur only because a baby does not take the breast into its mouth properly and does fail to suckle effectively. The claim that sucking a pregnant woman’s breast prepares her for breastfeeding after delivery is true. However, it is not suitable for all pregnant women as some of them get irritable uteruses or start to contract a major health challenge during pregnancy.

"Claim: a certain web-based message making the rounds on different social media platforms claims Tinubu is offering Nigerians 19,800  Naira as part of a support grant.","A serious threat on Social Media is that misinformation spreads faster than credible news. At the click of a button, users share information on health, politics, volunteer opportunities, jobs, businesses and all manner of things. A typical example is the message making rounds on social media asking people to follow a link to receive ₦19,800 from the Tinubu organization.  Bola  Ahmed Tinubu, is a foremost Nigerian politician; two-term former Governor of Lagos State, and current national leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC) whose dominant status in the Nigerian society is perhaps why the acclaimed link was widely spread on WhatsApp groups. In one group where the link was shared, one member commented that “I am sure Tinubu is sharing this money to boost his 2023 presidential aspirations” while another member rendered that “this is a scam, Tinubu is not giving out any money.”  Whatever the case may be, DUBAWA conducted multiple similar fact checks on typical links offering financial grants in the guise of prominent persons. In one case that was fact checked, the former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar was also said to give out grants, but like all former related claims, DUBAWA confirmed it to be a ruse.    Fraudulent websites are quite common and this sort of scams are often attempts by scammers to pretend to be trustworthy companies or organisations in order to get personal information from victims. Previously, it has been easier to identify fraudulent websites but scammers have now upgraded their tactics. As a result, DUBAWA opts to investigate the alleged link and the message in question.  As juicy and inviting as the claim appears to be, there is no official statement from Bola Ahmed Tinubu that backs it up or media reports that suggest its validity.   An analysis with Domainbigdata, a web tool used to verify a  website ownership, revealed that the website has been reported several times for abuses, attacks, and malware. Even more, the website in question was forcefully redirecting users to another site that appears to be for betting. This is a typical scheme by ‘malvertiziters’ to illicitly boost traffic to websites by forcing users to visit them. Another alarming reality noticed with the acclaimed website was the dummy testimonial comments it displayed. This is a typical strategy used by online scammers to lure prospective victims into their den. Another clear-red flag is the disparity between the amount of money pledged and the one outlined by the alleged testifiers (screenshot below). While the alleged grant offered 19, 800 Naira, others presented testimonies of N100, 000. This contradiction signals a shady  complot.  DUBUWA also noticed that the acclaimed link is a ‘Bitly URL’. Bitly URL is a shortening service and a link management platform that was established in 2008. It is privately held and based in New York City. Bitly  shortens over  600 million links per month, for use in social  networking, SMS, and email. While the motive behind its creation is to help entrepreneurs to easily share their links on social media, attract customers and sell their product or services, charlatans are now using it negatively to maladvertize, and draw traction to websites that offer no services at all.  According to Pandasecurity Bitly URLs are dangerous and people should be wary of them.  “Anyone who randomly scans bit.ly URLs will find thousands of unlocked OneDrive folders and can modify existing files in them or upload arbitrary content, potentially including malware. This way of distributing malware is worrisome because it is both quick and effective.” Evidenty, the points rendered proved true, as the alleged website demands users to share further to other users before accessing the said grant as seen in the screenshot above. This is a typical tactic used by scammers to draw traction to websites   Apparently, Tinubu is not offering a grant, and the acclaimed website is a scam. Based on the analysis carried out:  One key indicator of a genuine website would be the small padlock symbol next to the website address on the address bar.  The small padlock indicates that the website is secured by an TLS/SSL certificate that encrypts user data making the connection secure. It is easy to obtain an SSL certificate and scammers have taken advantage of this fact.  It is not unusual to have a single page website; some organizations use them to make it easier to navigate their content. All information is usually contained on the page including contact information and relevant information pertaining to the organization. The website in question does not have the contact information about the organization and the links on the website are redirected to a betting site. The process of redirecting links is known as deceptive redirection and is often quite common with spammers and fraudsters. Although many websites ask for some personal information one has to be careful with the information they provide online. Your personal information can be used to steal your identity and commit fraud. There is no website with full safety and privacy, so one has to be very careful while sharing any personal information.  To confuse people, fraudsters often use website names and URLs that are similar to websites they are trying to mimic.   Bola Tinubu’s organization holds the name Bola Tinubu Support Organization while the fraudulent website is Bola Tinubu Support Organization Support funds.  When in doubt, use a website checker to verify if a website is secure. A secure website check can let you know any vulnerabilities on the site, if it is using encryption and what level of verification a site has. Look out for trust indicators on a website Trust indicators or signals are elements that are often displayed on websites that help users feel more secure and are proof of a business’ conduct or trustworthiness. The most common indicators are: While genuine websites may not have trust indicators, most of them do. However, you should be careful and skeptical of sites that do not have these indicators.  If you receive a link to a fraudulent site, do not provide any sensitive information like your name and contact information. Additionally, do not repost or share the links to minimize the spread of misinformation.  You can also do something about Fraudulent websites. The Internet Crime Complaint Center or Google Safe Browsing are designed to deal with fake websites. To make submissions, you can easily copy the URL to the fake website and submit it to any of the above mentioned platforms. The process is easy and the results are usually timely.  As findings show, Bola Ahmed Tinibu, or any of his organisations, is not offering N19,800 as grants. This scheme is perpetrated by online scammers to lure and extort from unsuspecting members of the public.

Claim: A viral WhatsApp message claims Australian authorities are offering fully funded scholarships for international students at the University of Western Australia.,"A viral post on WhatsApp claims that the Australian Government is giving out fully funded scholarships to international students to study at the University of Western Australia. As usually done by many online fraudsters, the message moving across WhatsApp is a forward-as-received message that attempts to direct readers to a website with an URL that says it belongs to University of Western Australia. The content contained in the WhatsApp message reads: “AUSTRALIA SCHOLARSHIP 202I, STUDY IN University of Western Australia FULLY FUNDED SCHOLARSHIP FREE”. It says the scholarship will cover full tuition fees, accommodation, medical facilities, traveling, and stationary allowances of successful students.  The WhatsApp message ends with the instruction to apply via the link, https://bit.ly/Australia-scholarship-2021 The URL in the WhatsApp message directs users to a page where they are asked to provide personal details like names, email, country of origin among others.  The next option allows them to apply and when that is clicked, another page displays “congratulations” in bold. Here, they are further sent to another page where they are requested to share the link with people on WhatsApp and are also requested to make payment for a visa in order to enter Australia for studies.  Dubawa also found out that the site has an addition of a ‘Secure Sockets Layer’ (SSL certificate) which enables it to carry https://bit.ly/ to convince users that it is credible. According to Web Titan, the HTTPS or a SSL certificate alone is not a guarantee that the website is secure and can be trusted. Many people believe that an SSL Certificate means a website is safe to use. Just because a website has a certificate or starts with HTTPS does not guarantee that it is 100% secure and free from malicious intent. It just means that the website is probably safe. In the vast majority of cases, the sites may be. A check of the website shows that the Uniform Resource Locator URL, which shows the address of a given resource on the worldwide web, does not have the .gov.au domain which is used by most Australian government websites.  It only has bit.ly/Australia-scholarship-2021 domain that raises suspicion. Further checks on the website domain shows that the “ly” is the country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Libya.  In 2011, the bit.ly address was set to redirect to bitly.com. The .ly top level domain, TLD is controlled by the Libyan government, which has previously removed one domain deemed incompatible with Muslim law, and not the Australian Government or the University of Western Australia. According to Macaria.com Network, to register a website in Australia, one will have to “enter the “.COM.AU” and/or “.NET.AU” domain name(s) assigned to the country and not bit.ly. The University of Western Australia official website is https://www.uwa.edu.au/home. It has no information about fully funded foreign scholarships as purported in the WhatsApp message. Furthermore, the Australian Government’s information for international scholarships are posted on this website. If you check carefully, you will observe that the web address contains .gov.au and Australian-education/scholarship as opposed to the one in the viral WhatsApp message. Even though the website contains an SSL certificate, research and analysis of the site show it is not authentic.

MTN Nigeria launched its services on August 8, 2001. Since its launch, MTN has steadily deployed its services across Nigeria, connecting approximately 69 million people in communities across the country with each other and the world. Dubawa clicked on the link and it directed this reporter to a page with a cloned MTN logo. A cloned Facebook post which shows purported beneficiaries of the giveaway testifying can also be seen on the website. The website asked this reporter to answer three questions to get rewarded. “Question 1 of 3: How Long Have You Been Using Mtn? Question 2 of 3 questions: How Is Our Service In Your Locality? Question 3 of 3 questions:Rate Our Customer Care Services Out Of 5 ?” After answering the questions, users are required to share the information with 15 friends or five groups in order to get N20,000 cash, 5gb worth of data and win a car.

The page reads: “Now Select Your Choice Below “GET DATA  “GET CASH.” Selecting either of the options redirect users to another website and no money or data was given as claimed. Further analysis using Domingdata, a web tool used to look for a website ownership information, showed that the website has IP geolocation of the United States and it has several abuse reports. Dubawa checked the official Facebook page of MTN Nigeria and found that to celebrate its 20th anniversary, the company is giving all customers free calls of up to 5 minutes, free 200MB data and 20 Honda HRVs to 20 lucky customers. The post was accompanied by a photograph and a caption saying: “Wow! It’s been 20 years of connecting with hearts and families. You have played a huge role in our growth over the years. “Cheers to brighter years ahead. #TogetherAt20.” Findings have shown the claim is false and the website is fraudulent.

Claim: A photo making the rounds on the social media shows an organ trafficking alert purportedly issued by the Office on Drugs and Crime department of the United Organisations (UNODC) urging readers to beware of agents/companies offering them jobs abroad.,"Claim: A photo making the rounds on the social media shows an organ trafficking alert purportedly issued by the Office on Drugs and Crime department of the United Organisations (UNODC) urging readers to beware of agents/companies offering them jobs abroad.  No, this alert didn’t originate from the UNODC; it’s only a mimicry of another publication on the department’s website.  Organ trafficking, under the broader spectrum of human trafficking and migrant smuggling, has remained a huge problem the United Nations, other international bodies and governments of various countries seek to tackle.  The United Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons Especially Women and Children, provides the sole internationally accepted definition of trafficking in persons. Article 3 (a) of the protocol stipulates that “Trafficking in Persons shall mean the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of persons, by means of the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person, for the purpose of exploitation.  “Exploitation shall include at a minimum the exploitation of the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labour or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude or the removal of human organs.” It has been identified that migrants seeking greener pastures in other countries but do not have the option to migrate legally form the majority of those who fall victim to these organ harvesters. “Some victims are tricked or coerced into having their organs removed,” UNODC says. Several programmes have been organised to curb the spread of this menace by educating the people on the need for a legal migration process. These programmes are handled by organizations such as the International Organization for Migration among others.  Trafficking in persons for the purpose of organ removal is not a new phenomenon. Over the years, the crime has received significant attention from media, NGOs, academia and also from international and regional actors. These include the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially in women and children, Special Representative and Co-ordinator for Combating Trafficking in Human Being and Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe. Also, in 2013, the UN Economic and Social Council and the General Assembly adopted resolutions that inter alia request UNODC to collect and analyse information on trafficking in persons for organ removal and encourage Member States to provide to UNODC evidence-based data on patterns, forms and flows of trafficking in persons, including for the purpose of the removal of organs respectively. It has, however, remained a persistent problem, hence the focus. The international (transplant) community has developed standards and guidelines to govern transplantation, to regulate care for donors and thereby prevent organ-related crimes, including trafficking in persons for the purpose of organ removal. Of particular relevance are the WHO Guiding Principles on Human Cell, Tissue and Organ Transplantation, as well as the Declaration of Istanbul on Organ Trafficking and Transplant Tourism. Particularly in Nigeria, the establishment of the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP) on 14 July 2013 shows a concerted effort to put a stop to trafficking and consequently organ trafficking. The photo (pictured below) has been circulated on social media as an organ trafficking alert from the UNODC establishing the fact that there is a black market for human body parts.  The alert highlighted the most valuable organs and listed the cost of each one in dollars.  According to the alert, a kidney is said to cost $262,000 (N107, 813, 000); a heart goes for $119,000 (N48, 968, 500) and a liver $157,000 (N64, 605, 500). It reads, “The black market for parts of the human body is booming in the Middle East. A kidney now costs 262,000 dollars (131 million CFA francs); the heart costs 119,000 dollars (60 million CFA francs) and the liver costs 157,000 dollars (79 million CFA francs).  Beware of fake foreign agencies promising to make you work abroad.   “They process your papers, pay your plane ticket and just take you abroad pretending they want to find you a job, but instead, they kill their victims, recover all the precious parts of their bodies. Many people have been offered jobs in the Middle East and so far their families have been unable to locate them. Share to save lives.” This has been shared on some websites and across social media platforms such as Nairaland, a blog and on Facebook. According to a global report from 2020, while still detected in small numbers, trafficking for the purpose of organ removal was reported in North Africa, South and South-East Asia, Central America and Europe during the reporting period. It indicated that in 2017, about 25 victims were reported, and in 2018, this number had risen to more than 40. Meanwhile, females comprised most of the victims trafficked for sexual exploitation, and two-thirds of the victims were trafficked for forced labour. Most of the men were trafficked for organ removal. A link on the alert was entered and it brought out an error result. It is, however, observed that it is a mimicry of an archived link from UNODC.  While the comments on the photo highlighted the prices of human organs in the black market noting that it is on the rise in the Middle East, the archived link from the UNODC states that desperate situations of recipients and donors of human organs create an avenue for exploitation by international organ trafficking syndicated. It also stated that victims of these crimes could be vulnerable by virtue of poverty.  Dubawa also observed that the alert has previously been flagged by the AFP fact-check which stated that UNODC Pakistan had confirmed that the purported alert is fake. AFP quoted the regional branch of the UNODC as saying that the message “does not originate from UNODC and contains out-of-date information that is not related to current UNODC activities”. The photo had not originated from the United Nations as the body is yet to give a warning about a black market for human organs in the Middle East. Although there are efforts to curb the menace of organ trafficking by the organization, the Middle East was not one of the continents highlighted in past reports regarding this. Also, the UNODC is yet to give a cost for each vital human part.

"Claim: Several social media posts claim the United States of America (USA) gave Nigeria’s Federal Government 48 hours to detain suspended Deputy Police Commissioner, Abba Kyari, or face severe sanctions.","Claim: Several social media posts claim the United States of America (USA) gave Nigeria’s Federal Government 48 hours to detain suspended Deputy Police Commissioner, Abba Kyari, or face severe sanctions. The claim is false and misleading. The US did not give Nigerian Federal Government 48 hours ultimatum to detain Abba Kyari. Tons of reactions have greeted the indictment of suspended Deputy Police Commissioner, Abba Kyari, by the United States District Court for the Central District of California. The court indicted Kyari following his alleged involvement in the international scheme to defraud a Qatari school founder of over $1 million. The fraud scheme was masterminded by popular Instagram celebrity, Ramon Abbas, also known as Hushpuppi. According to the US court documents, Huspuppi allegedly bribed Kyari to have Kelly Chibuzor Vincent, one of his allies, jailed in Nigeria after a dispute over how to share the $1.1 million loot received from the Qatari businessperson.  Kyari arranged for Vincent to be arrested and jailed at Hushpuppi’s behest, and then sent Abbas photographs of Vincent after his arrest. Kyari also allegedly sent his bank account details to Hushpuppi. The said account was used to receive payment for Vincent’s arrest and imprisonment. The US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) secured a court order to arrest Kyari on July 26 and  to hold him in U.S. custody for his role in the fraud perpetrated by Hushpuppi. Soon after his indictment, Nigeria’s Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba, suspended Kyari and ordered a probe of the fraud allegations against him. Pressure is presently being mounted on Nigerian authorities to extradite Kyari to the US in order to face trial. Several social media accounts on Facebook and Twitter then started circulating a claim that the United States of America (USA) gave Aso Rock 48 hours to detain the suspended Kyari, or face severe sanctions. A Facebook post by Biafra TV with over 14,000 followers alleged that the US threatened to sanction Aso Rock if Abba Kyari is not detained within 48 hours. The post has gathered over 400 likes, 60 comments and 47 shares. The post reads: “BREAKING NEWS WE GIVE YOU 48HOURS TO DETAIN ABBA KYARI OR FACE SEVERE SANCTIONS – USA WARNS ASO ROCK.” On Twitter, Xpsliver(@Xpsilver1) shared the same post which has generated over 500 likes, and over 500 retweets. Dubawa checks revealed that the claim was not attributed to any source or office, even though it was widely circulated. A keyword search on the news showed that no credible media organisation has published reports on the purported US’ threats to the Nigerian authorities. According to a detailed report by Premium Times, the court ordered that Kyari and others indicted in the case be arrested. “The U.S. government’s ‘Notice for Request of Request For Detention’ signed by an Assistant Attorney of the U.S government, Anil Antony, highlighted the reasons for asking for Mr Kyari’s arrest and his subsequent detention. “Plaintiff, United States of America, by and through its counsel of record, hereby requests detention of the defendant. The government is entitled to a detention hearing under § 3142(f)” because Mr Kyari as “serious risk defendant will flee,” the report read. The claim that the United States of America gave 48 hours ultimatum to Aso Rock to detain Kyari or face severe sanctions is false and misleading.

Claim: A viral post by Naija Reality news claims that four FBI operatives arrived at the office of the Inspector General of Police in Abuja.,"A viral post surfaced on Naija Reality news Facebook page on the 1st of August 2021, with the claim that four US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) operatives arrived at the Inspector General of Police’ office in Abuja. The post was accompanied by a photo of four purported FBI operatives walking on the street.  The post generated 110 comments and 55 shares. The post was greeted with mixed reactions, as some of the users tagged the post to the Deputy Inspector General of Police, Abba Kyari. A reply by Hon Abdulqodir Yaqub reads “Arrest who. I laugh in Igbo. Abba Kyari is untouchable…” Another reply by David Okkolo, reads “Hon Abdulqodir Yaqub Abba Kyari welcome to America, Abba goes to foreign court, Hon Abdulqodir e shock u?” While several users tagged the post fake news. A reply by Olutayo Babatunde Emmanuel reads “These News look like a scammer News.. As well… Just Tell us… You want to make Money. Where is bandits shaa…. Cuz I’m still wondering where these FBI.. Landed” On July 29, 2021, an infamous Nigerian fraudster (Ramon Abbas) popularly known as Hushpuppi, who is currently facing charges of money laundering leveled against him by the United States Government implicated the Deputy Commissioner of Police, Abba Kyari as a party in an international scheme to defraud Qatari school founder and then launder over 1.1million dollars in illicit proceeds. A 69 page court document outlines a dispute among members of the crime syndicate which allegedly prompted one Vincent to contact the victim and claim that Abbas and Juma (Also a fraudster) were engaged in fraud. After this, Abbas allegedly arranged to have Vincent jailed in Nigeria by Kyari. The document further provided that Kyari allegedly sent Abbas’ account details into which he could deposit payments for Vincent’s arrests and imprisonment. Kyari, however, debunked these serious allegations leveled against him via his verified Instagram and Facebook accounts, even though the post was later deleted. A report by BBC shows that the United States Department of Justice has issued a warrant of arrest and has ordered the Extradition of the Deputy Inspector General of Police. The  IGP, however, suspended him pending the report from the committee in charge of investigation. Report has it that Kyari, who appeared before the panel headed by the Deputy Inspector-General of Police in charge of the Force Criminal Investigations Department, Joseph Egbunike, on the 4th August 2021, claimed he was innocent in the $1.1million Internet fraud perpetrated by the serial fraudster, Hushpuppi. Since this post didn’t give full details on why (FBI) operatives arrived at the Inspector General of Police’s office in Abuja, Dubawa clicked on the link below the post to get details but it redirected this reporter to a new website, with a story published on the 5th of June 2019, which is entirely different from the actual headline and photo. Dubawa then ran a word search to verify the information. A word search also revealed that  Sahara reporters published a story on the 30th of July 2021, stating that the FBI agents have met with the Inspector-General of Police (IGP), Usman Alkali Baba, on the 29th and 30th consecutively to demand the arrest and extradition of the Deputy Commissioner of Police. “According to a top source, four FBI agents met with the IGP on Thursday asking that Nigeria’s celebrated cop, Kyari be taken to the United States for interrogation over his role in the activities of suspected serial internet fraudster, Ramon Abbas, more commonly known as Hushpuppi.” This shows that Naija Reality news was trying to cull the report by Sahara reporters. Dubawa also conducted a Google Reverse image search ( a web tool used to verify the authenticity of images) on the photo of the four (FBI) operatives walking on Abuja street that was attached to the post, and  result revealed that the photo was attached to a publication on The Atlantic in 2019 with the caption “FBI agents near YouTube headquarters following an active-shooter situation in San Bruno, California, in April 2018.”  To verify the claim, Dubawa reached out to the Police Public Relations Officer, Frank Mba via calls and messages. None was answered or replied. Further verification revealed that the office of the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice has said that it has not received any official communication on the arrest warrant issued against Kyari, by the FBI  in the United States over the indictment in the  cyber fraud  saga, noting that a transfer process would not commence until there was a request from the United States to that effect.  At the time of filing this report, Dubawa didn’t get any public record in any credible platform to show that four FBI operatives arrived at the Inspector General of Police’s Office in Abuja, even though a top source has revealed that four FBI agents met with the IGP on Thursday and Friday, to ask for the release of the Deputy Commissioner of Police, so that he can be taken to the United States for interrogation over his role in the activities of suspected serial internet fraudster, Hushpuppi, there is insufficient evidence to back this claim,  since the Nigerian Police is yet to make this public. Verification has revealed that there is no public record in any credible platform to show that the viral post circulating social media that four FBI operatives arrived at the Inspector General of Police’s Office in Abuja.

"Claim: Oyo State Governor, Engineer Seyi Makinde, claimed recently that the Oyo State Pacesetter Quarry and Asphalt Plant, concessioned to Caboncor International Technology Limited under a public-private partnership arrangement, had started producing asphalt for the construction of our roads in the state.","Claim: Oyo State Governor, Engineer Seyi Makinde, claimed recently that the Oyo State Pacesetter Quarry and Asphalt Plant, concessioned to Caboncor International Technology Limited under a public-private partnership arrangement, had started producing asphalt for the construction of our roads in the state. Our investigation revealed that the plant is currently functional. Therefore, the governor is correct and the claim is true. In his State of State Address on June 10 2021, delivered before members of the Oyo State House of Assembly, Governor Seyi Makinde said that his administration had rescued some of the state’s moribund facilities, one of which is the Pacesetter Quarry and Asphalt Plant. The plant was concessioned to Caboncor International Technology Limited under a public-private partnership arrangement in 2020. Governor Seyi Makinde said, ‘We are resuscitating moribund industries. We concessioned the once-moribund Agbowo Shopping Complex, Ibadan and it is now being upgraded and reconstructed. The Pacesetter Asphalt Plant and Quarry, ljaiye, which we handed over to concessionaires in May last year is now producing asphalt for the construction of our roads.’ A check on Oyo State Investment and Public Private Partnership Agency indicated that commercial activities had commenced as of 31 May 2020 ‘after several years of the facility being moribund.’ The project which cost N750 million and managed by the concessionaire Messer Caboncor Technology Limited has a reactivation capacity from 100mt/d to 350mt/d within one year from May 31, 2020. On the 19 of December 2020, the Voice of Nigeria reports that the quarry ‘is now back to full production,’ giving indication that it was already fully operational, when Governor Makinde paid an on-the-spot assessment visit to the site of the firm. A June 4 report listed Carboncor International Tech. Ltd, the company managing the Quarry and one other company, as partners in the Oyo State government’s Zero Potholes project, an on-going initiative to rid the state of potholes. According to the report, the two companies were doing the project free of charge for one year, as part of their corporate social responsibility. An inside source who elected to remain anonymous told this writer that the quarry is indeed operating. ‘Yes, we are working. We have got some machines, and have upgraded the quarry from 100 tonnes per hour to 250 tonnes per hour. The Asphalt plant is currently operating at the capacity of 100 tonnes per hour.’ Based on media reports, reviews and criticisms, the evidence of the use of the asphalt from the Pacesetter Quarry and Asphalt company in the zero porthole initiative of the Oyo State Government, and the checks by the researcher, it is evident that the quarry is functional, and the Governor’s claim is true.

"Claim: An image of the suspended Deputy Police Commissioner, Abba Kyari, standing beside a man in a suit in the US to answer allegations over indictment by the FBI.","The immediate past head of the Inspector General of Police’s Intelligence Response Team (IGP-IRT) in Nigeria, Abba Kyari, has been in the eye of the storm in recent times following his indictment by the US District Court of California over his alleged involvement in a $1.1million fraud committed by social media celebrity, Ramon Abbas, otherwise known as “Hushpuppi”. Kyari’s indictment followed months of discreet investigations by the US’s Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) which accused him of ties with Abbas and requested a pre-trial arrest and detention for 10 days based on the order of the US court.  Following the outcry that greeted the indictment of Nigeria’s acclaimed super-cop by the US intelligence agency, the Police Service Commission (PSC) suspended kyari, a deputy commissioner of police, based on the recommendation of the Inspector-General of Police, Mr. Usman Baba with effect from July 31, 2021. Kyari is presently facing an investigation panel set up by the IG and headed by DIG Joseph Egbunike. However, numerous social media posts are circulating the image with claims that Kyari has presented himself to officials of the United States.  More than 500 people have shared the claim in a Facebook post published  by Jihar Katsina A Yau. On August 2, 2021, a Facebook user Jihar Katsina A Yau made a post claiming  The post alleges that Kyari was in the United States, trying to prove his innocence against the charges levelled against him. The picture, which is accompanied with some words captioned in Hausa, reads: “Political leader of Nigeria, DCP Abba Kyari has landed in California, USA to protect himself from all the accusations thrown against him. May he be protected from any form of accusation and lies and may Allah protect him. A righteous person can’t be stabbed”. The Facebook post has elicited sympathy and prayers from  viewers since its publication on August 2, 2021. A reverse image search conducted on the photo found that it was taken in 2019 and posted on Facebook by Kyari himself.  It was posted with the caption, “A visit to the office of the Secretary of States in Washington DC as part of our program. Despite many challenges, I believe we Nigerians can make our country to be equally great by God’s grace,” reads Kyari’s caption on the post published on April 20, 2019.  Kyari is currently facing a probe panel set up by the Nigeria Police. The picture circulating in posts purporting to show Kyari has travelled to the US to answer allegations of indictment by the FBI is false as it was recycled from 2019.

Claim: A viral WhatsApp message is urging Nigerians to apply for the 2021 Commonwealth Scholarship to study for free in the UK,"Nigeria is said to be the number one country of origin for international students from Africa. It sends the most students overseas of any country on the African continent, and outbound mobility numbers are growing at a rapid pace.  According to data from the UNESCO Institute of Statistics (UIS), the number of Nigerian students abroad increased by 164 percent in the decade between 2005 and 2015 alone– from 26,997 to 71,351, At least 40 percent of Nigerian overseas students are said to rely on scholarships. Recently, a viral  message  on WhatsApp asking Nigerians to apply for the commonwealth fully funded scholarships that “will cover full tuition, living expenses, accommodation, medical facilities, travelling allowance, stationery allowance and unlimited work permit,” caught attention. The message ended with the provision of a bit.ly link for applicants to apply. “*APPLY FOR UNITED KINGDOM SCHOLARSHIP 2021, FULLY FUNDED SCHOLARSHIP TO STUDY FOR FREE IN Uk.* *It takes a few seconds to apply. Dont miss this opportunity.* *Benfits of COMMONWEALTH 2021 scholarship Program.* *The scholarship will cover.* -Full Tuition Fee -Living Allowance -Acoomodation -Medical Facilities -Traveling Allowance -Unlimited Work Permit. *APPLY HERE* bit.ly/UK-FreeScholarships” It was first noticed that the message contained several grammatical errors and irregular capitalisation of words. Dubawa clicked on the bit.ly link and it directed this reporter to a new website with a welcome message that reads “Study in United Kingdom With Course of Your Choice For Free through-out The years program.The CommonWealth Scholarship Program Enables International Students to Study in United Kingdom Comfortably and Free. Applicants are to fill the form bellow and click on Apply 👇👇👇” The form requested applicants to fill in their full names, course, email address, country and whether this was their first application.  Dubawa filled in fake information, and this writer was led to another website. The new website congratulates the applicant, notifying them that their applications have been received, then it went further to request answers  to three questions quickly;  1. Current Level Of Study 2. Age Range 3. State of Interest After answering the questions, a message popped up immediately, that the application “has been approved for free” and that the applicant should fill the visa application form below. Applicants are then requested to share the link with their friends and groups.  Dubawa noticed irregular pop-ups while filling the application form,  in addition to excessive ads. Further analysis using Domainbigdata, a web tool used to verify the authenticity of a website,  showed that the website has  IP geolocation of United States, California, Sun City and it has been reported several times for abuses, fraud, and attacks. It is an agency-nominated master’s programme, funded by the UK Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) for candidates from eligible lower and upper middle income Commonwealth countries, to undertake full-time taught Master’s study at a UK university. These scholarships are offered under six development themes: Dubawa discovered that the commonwealth website looks different from the so-called scholarship website. Applicants must make their application through the Commonwealth Scholarship Commission’s  (CSC) online application system, in addition to any other application that they are required to complete by their nominating body. The CSC does not accept any applications that are not submitted via the online application system. So first off, applicants must apply to one of the following nominating bodies in the first instance – the CSC does not accept direct applications for these scholarships. So each nominating body is responsible for its own selection process and may have additional eligibility criteria.  Applicants must check with their nominating body for their specific advice and rules for applying, their own eligibility criteria, and their own closing date for application. Dubawa also observed that the Minimum qualification for the Scholarship is that applicants must be under 40 years of age as of September 1st of the current year, and applicants must hold a Bachelor’s or Master’s degree as of August 31st of the current year for applying for Master’s degree or Doctoral degree respectively. Dubawa also saw that the scholarship covers fees, approved fares, and personal maintenance. Other scholarships, awards, or bursaries that cover the same costs may not be held concurrently. Though it is true that the Commonwealth is offering fully funded scholarships, verification has revealed that the so-called website open for registration is a click bait and the  message is misleading.

Claim: An online medium published a supplementary list of the Nigerian Navy Recruitment  in 2020 claims  all 44 successful candidates are Northerners.,"The above is the headline and a screenshot of a news update from an online news platform – Sahara Reporters – on 12th July, 2021. The publication purported that candidates on the Nigerian Navy Supplementary List under the Buhari Government are all Northerners. How true is this? This claim is questionable as the Nigerian Navy had always ensured equal representation of all the regions in all its lists of successful candidates for its recruitments.  Did the Nigerian Navy release a supplementary list? Dubawa searched the Nigerian Navy website, where it found the Nigerian Navy recruitment and enlistment portal. The portal announces the LIST OF SUCCESSFUL CANDIDATES FOR THE NIGERIAN NAVY BASIC TRAINING SCHOOL BATCHES 31 AND 32 and presents an item list for shortlisted candidates as well as the list of names which was provided at the bottom of the page. The list was released in two batches as PDF files, titled batches 31 and 32. Further, Dubawa found that the lists published by the Nigerian Navy has candidates from all states and each PDF has 21 pages each. Batch 31  has 16 names from the FCT, 22 from Niger, 23 from Ondo and Taraba states while the remaining states have 24 names each. 852 names in total. Batch 32 has 851 names in all: FCT has  16 candidates, Niger and Ondo states – 22, Taraba – 23, Other states 24.  However, Dubawa  did not see a supplementary list on the Navy website and wondered why the list would not be published on the same platform that houses the original lists. Another thing worthy of question is why the Nigerian Navy would adopt different formats for the purported list. The arrangement and general outlook of the lists are different; Nigerian Navy made provision for three columns for names on the original lists published on its website (Surname, First name, other name(s)) while the list on the alleged supplementary list has  only two columns for names (Surname and First name).  In additional search by Dubawa, it found a disclaimer  issued by the Naval Headquarters, distancing itself from the purported supplementary list.  A call  to a reporter with Armed Forces radio  requested anonymity due to service rules. While addressing a question about the veracity of the purported supplementary list, she said a statement has already been issued through the Navy Director of Information, Suleman Dahun, referring to the statement  Dubawa has embedded above. Further Search by Dubawa showed that no credible media organization has published reports of any supplementary list of the successful candidates from one particular zone of the country.  In contradiction to the claim that the Nigerian Navy released a supplementary list which contains 44 names from the north, Dubawa found that there is no such list as the Nigerian Navy has debunked the claim in a press statement. In addition to this, no credible media platform has published the news. Hence, this claim is false.

"Claim: A Facebook user claims that the highest rank a woman can attain in the Nigerian Armed Forces is two-star general, due to certain policies.","Over time, there have been debates on gender inclusion and women representation in the Nigerian Armed Forces, with claims that female military personnel lack access to career advancement opportunities and are underrepresented in the senior cadres of the military. In March 2021, a Facebook user, Emmanuel Maduka Nwazue, claimed that the highest rank a woman can attain in the Nigerian military before retirement is two-star general, despite her impressive educational qualifications, training, experience and expertise. He claimed that this situation was due to certain “absurd” and “wicked policies”. The post reads: “So, no matter her impressive educational qualifications, training, experience and expertise, the highest rank a woman can attain in the Nigerian military is Two-Star General and she’s retired? “Now this is absurd! Wicked policies like this one are what we all should join hands and fight. Most importantly, I feel they’re what feminism should be up and against, and not the misplaced hatred for men that seem to characterise the behaviour of some ladies in Nigeria. “To put my expression simply, I’m only saying that if a boy has to go to school, a girl also has to; if both should graduate as engineers, both should be employed and paid as engineers without gender considerations. It’s called equity, as what’s good for the goose is equally good for the gander.” This claim attempts to drive a narrative of the underrepresentation of women in the Nigerian Armed Forces, with umbrages of institutional-driven gender segregation. It also seeks to paint the Nigerian Armed Forces as a gender insensitive and unequal opportunities employer that prevents women from attaining career advancement. This could have implications on public perception and discourage women who may be interested in careers within the Armed Forces. DUBAWA studied the Harmonized Terms and Conditions of Service (HTACOS) of the Nigerian Armed Forces and found no policies or provisions that limit the promotion of female military officers in the Nigerian Armed Forces. HTACOS is a document that spells out the terms and conditions of service for officers in the Nigerian Armed Forces – Army, Navy and Airforce. It is incontrovertible that women have distinguished themselves in service of the Nigerian Armed Forces, even rising to the rank of highly revered and exclusive level of generalship. For instance, Aderonke Kale, a psychiatrist, was promoted to the rank of Major General in 1994, becoming the first female to hold the rank in Nigeria and West Africa. She led the Nigerian Army Medical Corps. Another woman, Abimbola Olatilewa Amusu, also attained the rank of Major General in the Nigerian Army. She commanded the Nigerian Army Medical Corps from 2015 to 2018. There is also a Brigadier General Cecilia Akagu. These giant strides by women are not limited to the Army. Itunu Hotonu, a woman, also rose to the rank of Rear Admiral in the Nigerian Navy and the first in Africa. Others include Rear Admiral Ekanem–Nesiama and Navy Commodores Christie Okpara, Jamila Abubakar Sadiq Malafa. Contrary to the claim that “the highest rank a woman can attain in the Nigerian military is Two-Star General” due to “wicked policies”, Dubawa found that there were no policies in the Nigerian Armed Forces that limited women from attaining ranks beyond two-star general. The ranks of two star generals in the nigerian military are Major General (Army), Rear Admiral (Navy) and Air Vice Marshal (Airforce). Dubawa found that the rank of two-star general is arguably the highest substantive rank attainable through the normal promotional track in the Nigerian Armed Forces, and this is not gender-specific.  Promotions to the rank of three-star and four-star generals (Lieutenant General and General in the Army and their equivalent in other arms) were exclusively reserved for the country’s service chiefs. Following their appointment as service chiefs, officers are promoted to the ranks of General (Chief of Defence Staff), Lieutenant General (Chief of Army Staff), Vice Admiral (Chief of Naval Staff) and Air Vice Marshal (Chief of Air Staff). The essence of this is to set them aside in seniority and place them ranks above other officers of the Armed Forces.  Although rare, there have been some exceptions to this rule in the past. For instance, in July 2019, Lamidi Adeosun was promoted to Lieutenant General, the same rank held by the then Chief of Army Staff, Tukur Buratai. As Commandant of the Nigerian Defence Academy, Abel Akale also held the same rank of Lieutenant General, with the Chief of Army Staff at the time, Martin Luther Agwai. These are two of many cases of officers who, although not service chiefs, were promoted beyond two-star generals. In Nigeria’s history, no woman has ever been appointed a service chief in any of the three military branches or as chief of defence staff. Findings by Dubawa link this to the type of non-combat commissioning that had been available to females in the past. There are five types of commission in the armed forces namely; Regular Combatant Commission, Short Service Combatant Commission, Direct Regular Commission, Direct Short Service and Executive Commission. “Of all these types of commissions, it is only the Regular Combatant Commission that can give an officer the opportunity to aspire to head any of the services or rise to become the Chief of Defence staff,” Nigeria’s ex-Minister of Defence, Adetokumbo Kayode revealed during a media parley in 2011. That year, President Goodluck Jonathan issued a directive permitting the admission and training of female candidates at the Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA) and their subsequent enlistment as combatants in the Nigerian Armed Forces. These female cadets were nicknamed and have been known to be called “Jonathan’s Queens”. With this directive, the minister said: “The female regular combatant officers will therefore have the opportunity, as their male counterparts, to command major units of the army, fly fighter jets of the Airforce and to be seamen officers who could command a combat going vessel of the Nigerian Navy.” This arrangement and others, such as the recent establishment of the Nigerian Army Women Corps (NAWC), empowers women to participate in combat roles and discharge their duties effectively and raises the possibilities of the appointment of women as service chiefs and promotion to the rank of three or four star generals in the nearest future. The claim by a Facebook user that due to wicked policies the highest rank a woman can attain in the Nigerian military is two-star general, no matter her impressive educational qualifications, training, experience and expertise, is misleading.  Dubawa found that there are no policies that support the claim that the highest rank a woman can attain in the Nigerian Armed Forces is two-star general.

Claim: A social media post claims there are plans by the Kano State Government to ban women from driving vehicles in the state.,"Kano, alongside 11 other states in Nigeria’s predominantly muslim north, operates the Sharia code, an islamic legal system it adopted in 2000. The code outlaws the consumption of alcohol, adultery, homosexuality, and conversations between men and women in public places on the grounds of alleged immorality. It prescribes serious punishments such as public flogging, amputations, and stoning to death – all of which are enforced by the Hisbah Corps, the state’s special police force. Some of these laws have often been portrayed as particularly regressive in terms of women’s rights. For instance, in 2005, the state introduced a law segregating public transport. The law prohibited women from riding in the same buses as men and also banned women from riding behind men on motorcycles. “Our aim is to be at the forefront of conducting our activities decently and to protect Allah’s Sharia,” the then Kano governor, Ibrahim Shekarau, said of the law. The media space was recently hit with a claim that the Kano State Government was secretly working to enact a law that will bar women in the state from driving. The report, which was published by a blog, The Reflector, claimed the decision was a “secret plan” by the state government and the Council of Ulama in the state. “Barring any unforeseen development, Kano State Government in conjunctions (sic) with state’s Council of Ulama are planning to enact a law prohibiting women irrespective of any faith from driving vehicles in state (sic),” it reads. “This is from the fallout of a highly secretive meeting held at Sharia Commission during Sallah break between the Commissioner for Religious Affairs, Dr. Mohammed Tahir (Baba Impossible) with the team of the state’s Ulamas led by Sheikh Abdulwahab Abdallah BUK.” The report claimed that the purported bill whose drafting is in progress at the Kano State Ministry of Justice, would soon be presented to the State House of Assembly for ratification and enactment into law. It said the call for the ban was led by Sheikh Abdallah Usman Umar Gadon Kaya who said “allowing women driving in the state represents the darkest moments” for muslims. The report further reads: “In his submission, Dr Sani Umar Rijiyar Lemo posited that Kano State should borrow a leaf from Saudi Arabia, which, according to him, is a society governed by Islamic sharia laws. “In his remarks, Sheikh Abdallah Pakistan opined that there is no better time to enact such a law than now because the state is undergoing Islamic revivalism under Governor Ganduje. “Earlier, the state’s commissioner for Religious Affairs, Baba Impossible, assured the gathering of Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje’s commitment to sanitising Kano from all social vices. “As a Servant of Islam, Governor Ganduje would do everything to ensure Kano is set on the path of sanity, moral rectitude as enshrined by Islam,” he said. Participants at the secret meeting, as identified in the report include: “Sheikh Abdallah Usman Umar Gadon Kaya, Sheikh Abdallah Pakistan, Sheikh Abdulwahab Abdallah BUK, Sheikh Sani Umar Rijiyar Lemo, Professor Salisu Shehu, Dr Aliyu Umar Al-Furqaan among others.” If passed into law, the bill will bar women, irrespective of religion, from driving cars or any automobiles within the state. The blog post was seen by over 5,000 readers. The post which was also shared on social media, generated 414 retweets, 1,100 quote tweets and 320 likes. Dubawa did a keyword search and found that the report was not published on any credible news platform in the country. The claim has also been debunked by Mohammed Garba, the Kano State Commissioner for Information. In a statement on Tuesday, Mr Garba described the reports as “fallacious” and lacking credibility. “The trending story lacks credibility and that is why it is wholly attributed to a source that cannot be substantiated,” he said. Mr Garba noted that the state government would not hold a “secretive meeting” to decide on a critical issue that concerned its teeming populace, adding that even Saudi Arabia, a leading islamic country, had in 2018, repealed the law that barred women from driving. The report quoted a cleric who it said asked the Kano State to borrow a leaf from Saudi Arabia, which, according to him, “is a society governed by Islamic sharia laws”. However, a check reveals that women have been driving in Saudi Arabia for the past three years. In 2018, the Government of Saudi Arabia repealed a law which banned women from driving. The lifting of the ban was presented by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (commonly referred to by his nickname, MBS) as part of a sweeping initiative to modernize and diversify the economy away from heavy reliance on oil.  The move sought to open the Saudi society to the rest of the world, as well as attract foreign investments. The Crown Prince was hailed by Saudi rulers and much of the rest of the world as a feminist reformer. Thus, the ban on women driving in Saudi Arabia held more of a cultural outlook unlike the religious motive behind laws in Nigeria’s prevailing muslim north. The Kano Commissioner also expressed delight that some of the scholars mentioned in the report as supporting the alleged ban, had already dissociated themselves from it. One of them, Sheikh Abdullah Kaya, has described it as “fake news”. “I, Abdullah Usman Umar Gadon Kaya, strongly say that this is fake news. I don’t have any hands in it. It’s the act of enemies who want to crack peace in our dear state (Kano) and Nigeria at large,” the cleric wrote on Facebook. Dubawa also reached out to the Chairman of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) in Kano State, Reverend Samuel Adeolu Adeyemo and Sheikh Ibrahim Khali, the Chairman Council of Ulamas, who both described the information as “baseless.”  The claim in a widely circulated report that the Kano State Government was planning to ban women from driving vehicles in the state is false and unfounded. The report was not published by any credible news platform in the country.  Consequently, stakeholders in the state including the Chairman of the Council of Ulamas, the state’s Commissioner for Information, Chairman of the Christian Association of Nigeria, as well as one of the clerics mentioned in the report, have publicly debunked the claim, describing it as falsehood.

CLAIM: A viral video allegedly shows Hon. Ibrahim Abuna throwing cash at his people.,"CLAIM: A viral video allegedly shows Hon. Ibrahim Abuna throwing cash at his people.  The claim that Hon. Ibrahim Abuna representing Konduga, Mafa & Dikwa in the House of Representatives is throwing cash at his people as a form of empowerment is TRUE. The member representing Konduga, Mafa, & Dikwa Federal constituency of Borno State, in the House of Representatives, Engr. Ibrahim Abuna BUR BUR (APC), was alleged to be the person in a 25 seconds video making rounds on social media especially WhatsApp groups and Twitter, where cash is seen to be thrown at a group of people from a balcony and the people beneath scrambling to get their share.  The action was described as disappointing and disgraceful by many users who posted a comment on the video describing it as an act which is unbecoming of a federal lawmaker and the action was described as treating his people like dogs which peanuts are being thrown at. Dubawa began its verification using Google Image search with the name of the honourable to see any similarities between him and the man in the video.  Search returned a Facebook page of the legislator from Konduga, Mafa, Dikwa Federal Constituency, Borno State, with 2,598 likes. It contains several pictures of the member representing the above-named constituency with the name Engineer Ibrahim Abuna.   Screenshot of Hon.

Claim: Deputy Internal Affairs Minister Lahai Leema beaten up by an OSD guard because of his girlfriend.,"An image circulating on Facebook claims Sierra Leone’s Deputy Internal Affairs Minister Lahai Lawrence Leema was beaten up by an OSD Police officer over a woman. The claim has two other images attached with one depicting a disfigured face of someone that has been severely beaten and punched with one of the eyes completely closed as a result of punches and the other attached photo shows two unrecognizable men fighting on a street and believed to be the incident between the OSD and the Minister. The statement added to the post in Krio translates in English as “ Leema you know very well your legs are not strong, now look at the damage that has been caused to your face by the OSD guard”. As three images purports to be the minister of Internal Affairs in Sierra Leone- with one having the original photo of the Minister and others supporting the claim of an altercation and its outcome, Dubawa decided to have a verification done on the said claims to ascertain its veracity. The reverse image search was used and it identified the image with the punched face with that of Joshua Robinson. Joshua Robinson was an African American that was brutally manhandled by the US Police and severely beaten for allegedly breaking traffic rules in 2013. The image of his brutalized face after the assault in 2013 flooded the internet as it was a case of police brutality and  Google Reverse was able to keep hold of it. This is the image that was attached to the post claiming it is that of Sierra Leone’s Deputy Internal Affairs Minister. The third image that shows two grown men fighting on a street according to Reverse Search happened somewhere in Nigeria as you can hear Yoruba from the background and Yoruba is not one of our local dialects in Sierra Leone; clearly stating that the photo was not taken here and the video of the fight from which the image was screenshot clearly exposes the face of the two men of which none is our Deputy Internal Affairs Minister of Sierra Leone. From the analysis done on the images using the Google Reverse Image tool and its glaring explanation of the origin of the photos plus video evidence of the fighting claim clearly states that incidents are not connected to Sierra Leone and the Internal Affairs Minister.  It is therefore a false and misguided claim. ",claim,30/07/2021,https://dubawa.org/the-claim-of-deputy-internal-affairs-minister-beaten-up-for-a-woman-is-not-true/
Claim: A viral Twitter Screenshot making rounds on social media claims Bill Gates tweeted in solidarity with the Slaughter of  animals by Muslims during the Eid-El-Kabir celebrations,"Just few days before the Eid-El-Kabir festivity, a tweet by the Microsoft founder, Bill Gates went viral where he allegedly stated he was in support of killing animals for the Muslim festivities. A screenshot of this tweet has been shared across various social media platforms including WhatsApp status updates as a validation for the belief. The tweet reads, “I don’t want to see any tweet hating on Muslims for slaughtering animals; about 1 million animals get killed each day by KFC, McDonald’s, Burger King etc. to feed the rich & make hella money out of it. During Eid, Muslims sacrifice them to feed the poor for Free & y’all lose ur mind (sic).” Recently in Nigeria, the fight for animal rights has been gaining momentum especially on social media.  The fight also campaign against the act of fighting with rams during the Muslim festivals, describing the whole idea and process as animal brutality. Those who opposed the idea described that act as ‘barbaric’ and tantamount to animal brutality. Also, a petition filed on a website known as Change.org has been signed by over 9,000 people. The petition which started over a year ago was initiated by a UK-based international animal rights activist, Natasha Choolun. The petition, which was titled “Stop Nigeria’s Barbaric Dog Meat Industry,”  seeks a ban and shutdown of the dog meat trade industry in Nigeria. The petition alleges that the dog meat trade in Nigeria has become so prosperous so much so that dogs are “taken” from neighboring countries such as Niger and transported to Nigeria, to maintain the country’s growing demand for dog meat. It is the latter of the two official holidays celebrated within Islam (the other being Eid al-Fitr or ‘Festival of the Breaking of the Fast’), Wikipedia explains.  It honours the willingness of Ibrahim to sacrifice his son Ishmael as an act of obedience to God’s command. Before Ibrahim would sacrifice his son, however, God provided a lamb for him to sacrifice instead.  In commemoration of this intervention, animals are sacrificed ritually. One third of their meat is consumed by the family offering the sacrifice, while the rest is distributed to the poor and needy. Sweets and gifts are given, and people visit and welcome extended family members during the festival. The day is also sometimes called Big Eid or the Greater Eid. In the Islamic lunar calendar, Eid al-Adha falls on the 10th day of Dhu al-Hijjah and lasts for four days.  There are two Eid celebrations every year – Eid al Fitr, which marks the end of Ramadan and Eid al-Adha which celebrates Abraham’s sacrifice. Simply, Eid al-Adha is considered the holier of the two religious holidays and so it is referred to as ‘Big Eid’ whilst Eid al Fitr can be known as ‘Lesser Eid’. Eid al-Kabir means ‘Greater Eid’ and is used in Yemen, Syria, and North Africa, whilst other translations of ‘Big Eid’ are used in Pashto, Kashmiri, Urdu and Hindi. Dubawa’s first point of action was to trace the acclaimed tweet on Bill Gates’ Twitter Timeline. Our search was limited to the week of the Eid celebrations since the debate regarding the acclaimed screenshot started gaining traction on social media around that time. However, after a thorough search on Bill Gates twitter timeline was carried out, the acclaimed Tweet was neither found on his page nor was there a stamp of deleted tweet. Another  noticeable red flag is that Bill Gates rarely tweets on religious issues. The contents of his tweets are largely on climate change, environment, health, philanthropy and other major issues affecting humanity. As a result of this reality, we carried out an analysis of the acclaimed tweets to trace its actual source and results show that it was fake, forged using an online tool called ‘TweetGen’.  The Tweet generator is a website based application that allows online users to create fake tweets. The application can be used to create a tweet template of choice, with a date of choice and all other things that a real tweet embodies.  We also conducted image forensics of the fake tweet to compare it with  a real one taken from the ‘Twitter Public Policy’ page and an error level analysis on the two images,  checking the authenticity of opacity (0.95), error scale (94), JPEG Quality (94) on the same scale.  Image1 Image2 Also, a careful grammatical and syntax comparison of the acclaimed tweet with numerous of other tweets made by Bill Gates on his Twitter timeline shows that he does not tweet in abbreviations or slang English and he is also efficient with various spelling and punctuation rules which are all found on the acclaimed tweet attributed to him.  A content search of the acclaimed tweet also revealed that it was not the first time it went  viral. In August 2019, the tweet had gone viral arousing diverse reactions on the internet. Another check on Bill Gates’ Twitter handle showed that he never tweeted that. Also, a keyword search on Twitter revealed that a lot of people had tweeted the post originally and for those who retweeted the post none of the searches included Bill Gates’ as part of the originators of the controversial tweet. The tweet did not come from Bill Gates; rather it was photoshopped for the sole purpose of misinforming the public. It is false, Bill Gates never tweeted such.  EDITOR’s NOTE: The tweet image captioned ‘An example of tweet created by DUBAWA on the tool’ is not real. It was only created  for the purpose of illustration and clarity.

"Claim: A viral WhatsApp message claims that billionaire businessman, Obi Cubana, is giving out N25,750, as part of plans to celebrate his mother’s funeral.","Recently, Obinna Iyiegwu, popularly known as Obi Cubana, thrust himself and his hometown, Oba in Anambra State, into limelight when he laid his mother to rest with the mother of all funerals, a lavish event that would make the living envy the dead. Mr. Iyiegwu, a billionaire and chief executive officer of Cubana Group, is known to be a philanthropist, who has empowered youths within and outside his community. Mrs Iyiegbu, who passed away in December 2020, was buried on Friday, at Oba, in Anambra State. At the funeral, wads of money in various currencies and denominations rent the air and scattered across the grounds, in a show of extravagance, courtesy of friends and associates who came to rejoice or mourn with Obi and family. Days after the funeral, the media space is still filled with frenzy from the event – the most talked-about in Nigeria at the time. A WhatsApp message making rounds claims that Obi Cubana is giving out N25,750 to people as part of  celebration of his mother’s funeral. The forward-as-received message seeks to direct users to a blog website using the URL shortener service, bit.ly. The message reads: “OBI CUBANA GIVEAWAY N25,750 giveaway as part of OBI CUBANA Mothers Burial. This Giveaway is Available to All Get Now. http://bit.ly/Obi-Cubana-25k-Giveaway” After clicking the attached link, users are directed to https://obigiveaway.blogspot.com/?m=1, a site which opens with a message: “OBI CUBANA is celebrating his mother’s burial with giveaway to all interested people, Get Your Own ₦25,750 By Filling The Form Below👇👇”. Dubawa found that the page is hosted on blogspot, Google’s free blogging and domain service.  The layout and design of the page is shabby and unprofessional, which is quite odd for a scheme purportedly owned by a billionaire. The page requests an email address and Dubawa submits a wrong one to enable access to the other pages of the form. The next page opens with a congratulatory message: “You have been selected to benefit from the GIVEAWAY provided by OBI CUBANA MOTHERS BURIAL”. Thereafter, users are requested to answer three successive questions “to benefit immediately”: “Question 1 of 3: Are you Obi Cubana fans? Yes, No, Others Question 2 of 3: What is your marital status? Married, Single, Divorced Question 3 of 3: Why do you What This Giveaway? Data, Food, Alcohol”. After supplying answers to the questions, users are required to share the information with “15 friends and groups”. Completion of this step, the site says, will allow users “obtain the withdrawal code from the electronic counter” . Screenshot of the invitation page The notification reads: “You may get the with only one step, kindly click the “Invite Friends/Group” button below to share this information with 15 friends or 5 groups on WhatsApp so That They Can Also Benefit.” Assessment of the information on the page shows irregular capitalization of words, grammatical and spelling errors, which breeds doubts about its authenticity. These errors are spotted in the headline and some questions. For instance Question 3 asks:“Why do you What This Giveaway?”. Dubawa also observed a section on the page purportedly showing facebook comments. A closer look revealed that it is actually an image designed by the owners to deceive gullible users with the impression of an embedded facebook comment section. Following through with the process, Dubawa did 15 clicks on the “invite friends/groups” button and got redirected to the final page – “the final step of human verification”. The page reads: “To facilitate the sending of money you must complete this final step of Human Verification! You need to be careful to carry out tasks that you will be paid according to your Account Type. (Remember, this step is very important) Now Select your account type”. Users are given the options: Savings Account and Current Account, to select from. Selecting either of the options, opened another website in a new tab. Using the inspect element option, Dubawa observed that both account options had been programmed to redirect users to this website and not a payment gateway to process the transfer of the supposed N25,750 giveaway, as one would expect. Using a keyword search, Dubawa also found other phony websites (here and there), spreading the same giveaway claim, further deepening doubts on their authenticity. The message widely circulating on WhatsApp claiming that billionaire businessman, Obi Cubana, was giving out N25,750 to celebrate his mother’s burial is FALSE.  At the end of the process on the website, no money is given as claimed. Dubawa found that the website is not authentic, spotting spelling and grammatical errors. We also found other phony websites sharing the same false claim, further casting shadows on the authenticity of the scheme.

Claim: Several social media  platforms claim that there was a plane crash at the Ilorin International Airport on the 22nd of July 2021. It was also tweeted by Sahara Reporter and  BBC English News among others.,"Claim: Several social media  platforms claim that there was a plane crash at the Ilorin International Airport on the 22nd of July 2021. It was also tweeted by Sahara Reporter and  BBC English News among others.  Findings revealed that although there was a tyre burst of an airplane while it was taxiing at the Ilorin International Airport, there was no crash and no casualties. The Ilorin airport became an International airport in 2007 with both a domestic and International terminal. In order to boost the standard of the airport, the then administration of Kwara state led by Dr. Bukola Saraki, upgraded the airport to an International Standard, including the construction of a Cargo shed to create employment and improve the state’s gross domestic Product (GDP).  But recently, aviation activities were boosted with more airlines landing and taking off, resulting in improved economic activities in the state. Air peace, the owner of the purported plane that was claimed to have crashed, began aviation business in Ilorin on the 11th of June 2021. On the day of its inauguration, the ceremony was delayed because the inaugural plane had a hitch. Consequently, when it had a tyre burst at around 10a.m. on Friday the 23rd of July 2021, various social media platforms were quick to release Headlines such as “JUST IN: Plane crashes in Ilorin as passengers escaped death” This was by a media platform called Solacebase.com. This no doubt caused pandemonium in Ilorin Metropolis and in many parts of the country as every newsroom scampered to make headlines of the report. Screenshots of captions from Daily post and BBC news Dubawa called the Head of Corporate Affairs of the Nigeria Airport Authority Ilorin, Adeyeoluwa Oluwakayode who clarified that there was no crash.  “Yes, there was no plane crash,  the Air peace plane had a burst tire on landing roll while it was still on the runway of the Ilorin International Airport” Mr. Oluwakayode said. He Added that, “all sixty-six passengers alighted safely from the aircraft. This is just a case of unconfirmed information.” Also, in a press release titled “No Air Peace Aircraft involved in accident” signed by Sam Adurogboye, the Public Relations Officer, Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA), the rumour regarding the plane crash was debunked and a more detailed explanation was offered, highlighting the actual situation that took place. Even more, the Accident Investigation Bureau (AIB), also in another Press Release, said the Bureau is not investigating the matter because it is not an unusual hitch with planes at airports. Dubawa also visited the airport and found that there was actually a hitch on the runway and the affected aircraft was positioned at a point where other planes were supposed to pitch landing. As a result, flights had to be counseled to clear the runway. However, there is no sign of a plane crash site as flight operations have resumed already at the airport. Although it is true that there was a tyre burst of an Air Peace plane B737-500, with registration number 5N-BQR at the Ilorin International Airport, it is not true that the plane crashed as reported by some media platforms.

Claim: A TikTok video that has gone viral on WhatsApp in Nigeria shows a desperate feminist begging for a husband.,"Feminism is an ideology that seeks to protect women’s rights, especially from patriarchal men and institutions, as well as from cultures that subjugate their interests. Feminism is believed to have started in the West when women fought for the rights to vote and own property. It has now grown to become a global ideology with multiple variants and waves, depending on the contexts of its proponents. Many think feminism prevents women from getting married or sustaining their marriages, especially in Africa, because the ideology is thought to discourage women from submitting to their husbands, who are regarded as the heads of the family in culture and religion. The excitement is therefore understandable when Nigerians saw a video of an ex-feminist renouncing the ideology, pleading for marriage and promising to be submissive. The TikTok video has been “forwarded many times” on WhatsApp. The 1 minute 45 seconds TikTok video shows a black woman crying over how feminism has led her to become very lonely without a man. She expresses regrets over her previous feminist ideology and begs for a husband, pleading that she would serve and obey him as a wife should. The video was also seen on Instablog9ja, a popular Instagram blog. Dubawa searched TikTok and found the video on Peace Loise Mbae’s page. She has 28,400 followers and has generated over 281,000 likes. She identifies as female and ex-feminist and produces content around satire, commentary and comedy. Dubawa searched for the video and saw that it was shared just days ago but it has been watched over 23,000 times, shared over 4,500 times and has attracted over 3,200 comments as at the time of this writing. But do people believe this satire? Many people actually do, and there are several comments trying to give her hope and encourage her to be positive.  Interestingly, not all Peace’s followers believe in the satire. Some caught the joke and had a good laugh. Interestingly, some followers are so loyal they feel a need to protect her from those enjoying the comedy. They continue to admonish people to take the video seriously. At some point, Peace confirms to some followers that the video is indeed a satire, but will most people see this comment? The TikTok video uploaded by a Kenyan lady, Peace Loise Mbae and forwarded many times on WhatsApp in Nigeria is a satire. You can learn more about satires by reading this article.

Claim: A written text on a viral WhatsApp video claims that a large entourage followed Sunday Igboho to court in Benin Republic.,"Nigerians have increasingly grown curious about the state of affairs of Mr. Sunday Adeniyi Adeyemo (popularly known as Sunday Igboho) since his arrest by Beninise authorities on July 20, 2021.  Sunday Igboho, a separatist and tribal activist has been calling for the creation of an independent nation (Oduduwa Republic) for the Yoruba ethnic group which dominates Nigeria’s South West region. Sunday Igboho is a dual-citizen of Nigeria and Germany.  The Nigerian government regards Igboho as a dissident and ordered his arrest but he escaped when his house was raided on Thursday, July 1, 2021. Sunday Igboho had since been on the run, with various disinformation about his arrest until he was apprehended by authorities in Benin Republic, Nigeria’s West African neighbour at the country’s Cardinal Bernadin International Airport while trying to escape to Germany. The mainstream and social media in Nigeria have been bombarded with opinions on what should happen to Igboho, how he should be treated in prison and what positions they think Beninise and German authorities, as well as Yoruba leaders should take on his repatriation, freedom as well as his agitations.  A 29-second video went viral on WhatsApp in Nigeria, showing a video of Igboho in an entourage with a large crowd of people celebrating him. The video has a text on it which reads “D LION OF AFRICA SUNDAY IGBOHO IS ON HIS WAY TO COURT IN COTONU”. While Sunday Igboho has indeed been to court in Benin Republic, there has been no credible report of an entourage accompanying him to court.  Dubawa did a keyword search and found two links with longer versions of the videos but without the text. The first link took us to a 9 minutes 58 seconds video on FaceTV Africa’s YouTube page which contains background comments from a Yoruba speaking crowd praising Igboho. The video which was posted on June 6, 2021 had the following description: “SEE THE MASSIVE CROWD THAT WELCOME CHIEF SUNDAY IGBOHO TO ODUDUWA NATION MEGA RALLY IN EKITI STATE”. The video had been watched 1,303 times. The second link reveals a 10 minutes 2 seconds video on the YouTube page of Gbefila TV which contains the same video posted on FaceTV Africa with the description “SEE THE CROWD THAT WELCOME CHIEF SUNDAY IGBOHO IN EKITI STATE MEGA RALLY”. The video has been watched 630 times. Screenshot of the video on Gbefila TV’s YouTube page Dubawa also got a yahoo link to several videos of the different rallies he had held across South West Nigeria before his arrest, but none since he had been arrested in Benin Republic. The text on the short video claiming that Sunday Igboho went to court in Cotonou with an entourage is misleading. The video was from a June, 2021 rally in Ekiti State, Nigeria.

"Claim: A video that recently went viral on YouTube showed the General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, Pastor Enoch Adeboye, saying late televangelist, Temitope  Joshua tried to kill him.","Claim: A video that recently went viral on YouTube showed the General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, Pastor Enoch Adeboye, saying late televangelist, Temitope  Joshua tried to kill him.  This video is misleading as it had been manipulated.  On June 5, news of the death of the founder of the Synagogue Church of All Nations, Temitope Joshua filtered into the surprise of many Nigerians. The death of the popular televangelist was confirmed in a statement by the church on Sunday, June 6th. The statement reads, “On Saturday 5th June 2021, Prophet TB Joshua spoke during the Emmanuel TV Partners Meeting: Time for everything – time to come here for prayer and time to return home after the service. “God has taken His servant Prophet TB Joshua home – as it should be by divine will. His last moments on earth were spent in the service of God. This is what he was born for, lived for and died for. T.B Joshua, before his death, was one of the most powerful preachers in Africa with thousands of followers in Nigeria and abroad. He was in the good books of some political leaders, sports stars and entertainment celebrities who paid visits to his church for miracle healings, predictions of victories during elections among other matters. Joshua was also widely known for his philanthropy as he distributed food items and money to less privileged members of society. This was usually aired on his channel, Emmanuel TV, alongside the church’s programme and miracle sessions. The cleric before his death was bedeviled by controversies from Christendom and the secular world.  Many Nigerian pastors often kept T.B Joshua and his church at arm’s length possibly over his style of miracle healing, which some claim is not biblical. Notwithstanding, the late televangelist courted some big wigs in the Christian Community as evident in the status of clerics who visited SCOAN premises paying tributes to T.B. Joshua.  There have also been allegations of sexual harassment levelled against Joshua by former female church members.  Also, there have been some prophecies he had given which ended up being false. In 2016, the founder of The Synagogue Church Of All Nations, predicted a ‘narrow’ victory for Hillary Clinton, the Democratic Party presidential candidate, ahead of the November 8 election. This turned out to be false as Donald Trump emerged as President.  With the ravaging effect of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Nigerians had longed for a cure and an end to the lockdown. In the midst of this, T.B Joshua gave a prophecy that the virus will end on March 27. This has also proved to be false as a year on, the delta variant of the COVID-19 was confirmed in Nigeria. In September 2014, a guesthouse in the SCOAN premises believed to be for foreign members of the church collapsed, leaving many worshippers dead.  But, in his defence, Joshua said reports that the church auditorium had collapsed and that there had been heavy casualties were not correct. “The few people that were there are being rescued,” he said He linked the collapse of the building to a “strange aircraft” which he said hovered around the building before its collapse. However, a Nigerian journalist, Nicholas Ibekwe, accused Joshua of offering bribes to reporters covering the collapse of his Church’s guest house. With a life shrouded in controversies, philanthropism and prophecies, the death of T.B Joshua came as a shock to Nigerians as the cleric died a few days to his 58th birthday.  Following his death and burial rites that took days, General Overseers of major churches in Nigeria had come under fire for not sending condolence messages to T.B Joshua’s family and church.  One of these men is the General Overseer of Redeemed Christian Church of God, Pastor Enoch Adeboye, who had lost his son barely a few weeks before Joshua’s death.  The basis of the argument was that when Adeboye’s son died, T.B Joshua sent a condolence message, explaining why many questioned Adeboye about not returning the same courtesy when the prophet died.  Amid this, a manipulated video surfaced online showing Adeboye telling his congregation that, “T.B Joshua tries to kill me, I’m not dying yet.” Dubawa observed that YouTubers have shared the video as one part of the video where Adeboye mentioned T.B Joshua was merged with another part of the video where the cleric said, ”…tries to kill me.” It then appeared as if the cleric said, “T. B Joshua tries to kill me, I’m not dying yet.”   A YouTuber, Youtube Queen who initiated the conversation alleging that Pastor Adeboye recently said T.B Joshua tried to kill him, garnered over 322, 000 views and over 3,000 likes for the video.  The YouTuber further claimed the video was very recent as it had just surfaced in June 2021 when T.B Joshua was confirmed dead.  She further kindled a conversation about perceived animosity between Adeboye and Joshua.  She said, “The video is not old, for those of you who think it is an old video. He said this just four days ago, we were all waiting for Daddy G.O to say something but he refused, imagine what he has now come out to say.” However, in a recent development, Adeboye, in a letter signed on June 15, before the claim surfaced, sent a condolence message to Evelyn Joshua, wife of the late cleric. In the letter, Adeboye said he joined millions of people worldwide to register the church’s condolence with her on the passing of her husband. He also said he believed he would meet Joshua at the feet of the Lord Jesus on the resurrection morning. Dubawa observed that the video was from one of the church sessions during the 2018 Holy Ghost Congress of the church with the theme: ‘Glory Ahead’. Running a keyword search on Google, Dubawa observed that the speech of the cleric was reported by reputable media organizations on December 10, 2018.  In the original video, Adeboye had warned members to desist from purchasing keyholders which carry his pictures or that of his wife as he emphasized that he is an ordinary man who cannot take the place of God.  Adeboye explicitly stated that anyone who is glorified like God or above God is likely to be in very great trouble.  He advised members of his congregation to report anyone selling such keyholders to the police and made a brief reference to one of such keyholders containing his picture with that of T.B. Joshua.  His words, “It has been brought to my attention that some people are selling car keys, bracelets etc with my picture and the picture of my wife on it. May I appeal to you in the mighty name of Jesus, don’t buy it from them. “If you have bought them, throw them away, if you see those who are selling them, report them to the police, I didn’t send them. I have nothing to do with them, I am an ordinary man, I am not God.  ”What these people are doing can lead to serious trouble, not for them but for me. God will not share his glory with any man. If at any time, God senses that a man is trying to share his glory, that man is dead and whether the devil likes it or not, I’m not going yet. I am not going anywhere yet so if you find anybody selling anything whatsoever with my picture there, either my picture or my picture with my wife or with somebody else, report them to the police. “It is not only that, a woman bought one from them, gave it to a child and you know children, anything you give them, they think it is food, so the child began to eat it and when the mother tried to take it away, she saw that my picture there had opened and underneath my picture was the picture of TB Joshua and you know what that means.  ”Please do not cooperate with anybody that tries to kill me, I’m not dying yet.” From checks, the first 8 seconds of the video has been edited and manipulated. The video is not new, neither did Adeboye make a direct reference to Pastor T.B. Joshua as someone who tried to kill him.

Claim: Sleeping with one’s phone under the pillow is dangerous to one’s health.,"The usual practice for most people, especially youths who fiddle with their phones the most, is to sleep with it close to them, especially underneath their pillows. This is because it aids easy access to the phone and enables them to hear when it rings. However, an article by Pulseng recently was posted online on the reasons why one should not sleep with a phone under the pillow. The article is tagged “Why sleeping with one’s phone in bed can affect one’s health.” And as such, people have now reacted to it, saying that sleeping with one’s phone under the pillow is dangerous. According to the article, sleeping with your phone near you can be harmful for your bodily functions and tends to limit the production of many significant hormones. It could even damage one’s brain. The article advocates that it is better to place the phone several feet away from one’s bed if it is not going to be switched off. Some Twitter users SG(@sgxphotos) and Redheaddevilchild (@redheaddevilch1) have reacted to the claim in different posts. So, is it then true that sleeping with one’s phone under the pillow is hazardous to one’s health? This researcher discovered that this question has been raised a couple of times, especially on Quora, an American question and answer website. A user of the website identified as Owen Saltvold while answering the question, said it is completely safe for one’s brain and health to leave the phone close when one sleeps. While another user  Lieselotte Laura said putting her phone close to her head for use as an alarm clock caused her headache and as such that practice is not safe at all. This researcher also discovered a video on Facebook that spells the danger of sleeping with one’s phone underneath the pillow and it has so far garnered 226,000 views. According to an IT education website Technopedia, a mobile phone is a wireless handheld device that allows users to make and receive calls. While the earliest generation of mobile phones can only make and receive calls, today’s mobile phones do a lot more, accommodating web browsers, games, cameras, video players, extra voice and data services. A mobile phone typically operates on a cellular network, which is composed of cell sites scattered throughout cities and even villages. However, the cellular network used for mobile phones now called ‘smart phones’ has also evolved. Every day, we’re swimming in a sea of electromagnetic radiation (EMR) produced by electrical appliances, power lines, wiring in buildings, and a heap of other technologies that are part of modern life. From the dishwasher and microwave oven in the kitchen and the clock radio next to your bed to the cellular phone you hold to your ear—sometimes for hours each day—exposure to EMR is growing and is said to be becoming a serious health threat. For some, it is the EMR from cellular phones–both the radiation from the handsets and from the tower-based antennas carrying the signals, which some studies have linked to development of brain tumours, genetic damage, and other exposure-related conditions. Mobile phones are low-powered radio frequency transmitters, operating at frequencies between 450 and 2700 MHz with peak powers in the range of 0.1 to 2 watts. The handset only transmits power when it is turned on. The power (and hence the radiofrequency exposure to a user) falls off rapidly with increasing distance from the handset.  A person using a mobile phone 30–40 cm away from their body – for example when text messaging, accessing the Internet, or using a “hands-free” device – will therefore have a much lower exposure to radiofrequency fields than someone holding the handset against their head. A Consultant Radiologist with the University of Medical Sciences, Ondo (UNIMED), Dr Femi Akindeju, said it has not necessarily been proven that sleeping with a phone underneath a pillow is dangerous to one’s health, adding that phones however emit low radio waves that have little or no effect on one’s health. He said, “when it comes to physics, phones use radio waves and in electromagnetic waves, we have so many in the spectrum, some with very low energy and others with very high energy and we know that all these smartphones use radio waves, but they are in the lower chain of the spectrum and to a large extent this shows that it has very low energy unlike those with high energy like X-ray and gamma ray.” “The thing with electromagnetic waves is that it has the potential of causing Ionization, especially if it has high energy. However, radio waves do not have such power or effect as the energy is not enough so as to cause ionization of the cells.  “I would however discourage the long exposure of people to their phones, but as for sleeping with phones under a pillow, I won’t actually say it is dangerous, because the length of time one will have to be in contact with one can usually not be reached as far as radio wave is concerned,” he said. A radiographer with the University College Hospital (UCH), Dr Taiwo Orimogunje, said that sleeping with a phone under a pillow is dangerous. Dr Orimogunje said “well, it’s been known that gadgets like mobile phones do emit some radiation, and this could readily affect one’s brain, especially children. It has also been said to cause tumours in the brain and so it is a risk factor for the development of some brain tumours like Meningioma which is a tumour that covers the brain and spinal cord just inside the skull.” Meanwhile, a Consultant Neurologist, Dr Taofik Sunmonu with the Federal Medical Center (FMC), Owo, Ondo state, said there is no evidence to support such claims, adding that it is just what people have come to believe over time. “We have been hearing about this claim before now, and this is due to the radiation which emits from the phones and other gadgets but the quantity varies. And it is also believed that if the phone is too close to a person for too long, then the amount of radiation will be different and could be dangerous- but that is basically what we know for now.” “However, it is not the best practice to put phones close to one’s head, because anything that emits radiation over time can damage tissues in the body and as such when you want to sleep, it is better to put your phones away from you” he said. Although there is no evidence to prove medically if indeed sleeping with a phone under a pillow is dangerous to one’s health, it has been proven that phones do emit a level of radiation. So, it is, therefore, advised that users prevent prolonged usage of the phone and always keep the phones away from themselves when going to bed.

"Claim: A viral report making the rounds on social media and some online news media claimed that the Nigerian customs, in Niger State, intercepted a truck loaded with 200,000 live ammunition along the Wawa-Banana border on the way to Onitsha from Benin Republic, on the 10th of July 2021.","A viral report making the rounds on social media and some news platforms  claims that officials of the Nigeria customs service in Niger state have recently intercepted a truck loaded with 200,000 live ammunition. The truck with Lagos registration number AKD904X was reported to have been intercepted at Wawa-Babana area of Niger state, a border town with Benin republic. Aside from social media, some blogs published the report. CKNNigeria had the headline, “Customs intercepts truck carrying 200,000 live ammunition in Niger.”  It didn’t stop there, on the 11th of July 2021, Naijanews published the same story with the same headline, giving it a touch of recency.  Same claim, shared by NaijaNews on July 11th, 2021 On Facebook, Vanguard Newspaper also shared the same post on the 11th of July 2021. A user commented; “Good job to the security forces” while another added that “What is this country even turning into?”  Vanguard news on Facebook shared the claim on July 11, 2021 While the claim has enjoyed multiple shares across platforms, some internet users  claimed the incident happened in 2018 and not in 2021. This inconsistency led DUBAWA to investigate the actual year the interception of live ammunition happened.took place.  Firstly, Dubawa reached out to the Nigeria Customs Public Relations Officer for Niger/Kogi Area Command, Emmanuel Tangwa, who said the event took place three years ago and that the recent publications were misleading to make it look new.  “The operation actually took place, and it was widely reported in the media. The contradiction here is that it took place three years ago in 2018 and not as recently implied,”he said. He added that a press statement has already been released to clear the air on the publication. DUBAWA received a copy of  the press statement on WhatsApp and it clearly stated that it took place in 2018 and not recently in 2021.  Also tracking the time trail of the information via google search, DUBAWA noticed that the news first emerged in 2018 and was widely published by many media outlets.  Channels Television published it on its website back in 2018 and also broadcast it via its news Television Channel. TheCable also published the news of the interception back in July 2018 with the caption “Customs: we seized a truck conveying 200,000 live ammunition.” Though it is true that the Niger/Kogi Area Command of the Nigeria customs intercepted a truck load of 200,000 live ammunition, the event took place  in 2018 and not in 2021 as it is now widely and recently shared. This claim is therefore misleading.   ",Tangwa,22/07/2021,https://dubawa.org/nigeria-customs-intercepted-200-000-live-ammunition-in-2018-not-2021-as-viral-report-suggests/
"Claim: Nigeria’s Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, recently claimed that the administration of former President Olusegun Obasanjo spent between €300 million and €400 million on equipment for fighting insecurity in the maritime sector, and alleged that the equipment purchased is nowhere to be found.","On Thursday the 10th of June 2021, Nigeria officially launched the Integrated National Security and Waterways Protection Infrastructure, also known as the Deep Blue Project.  The project displays some of the $195 million of equipment with the primary objective of securing Nigerian waters along the Gulf of Guinea and the country’s oil infrastructure with a coordinated combination of land, sea, and air forces. According to a statement by Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency,   Nigeria’s Maritime Security Unit (MSU) of the Deep Blue Project, comprised personnel from the Nigerian Navy, Nigerian Army, Nigerian Air Force, Nigeria Police, and Department of State Services, and their goal was to demonstrate their preparedness for full deployment to fight the ongoing menace of piracy, mostly emerging from the Nigeria’s Niger Delta region. It was during the official inauguration of the Integrated National Security and Waterways Protection Infrastructure in Nigeria (also called the Deep Blue Project) at the ENL Terminal, Apapa Port, Lagos, the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, alleged that President Olusegun Obasanjo administration spent between €300 million and €400 million on equipment for fighting insecurity in the maritime sector, but that the equipment so allegedly purchased disappeared. He said: “This war, under President Obasanjo; they spent between €300 million and €400 million to buy the same equipment we have bought and they have disappeared.” The Deep Blue Project (DBP) was first initiated in 2017 by the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi. One of the first steps involved the Nigerian Government approving a maritime security contract with Israeli firm HLSI Security Systems and Technologies Limited for asset procurement and leasing. In 2020, Amaechi requested further funds to hire fast intercept vessels for one year, claiming the $195 million already approved for the same purpose had been put on hold due to COVID-19. In total, Nigeria has allocated a tenth of its defence budget to the DBP and is expected to deploy an increased range of assets to tackle maritime insecurity including two Special Mission Vessels, seventeen Fast Interceptor Boats, two Special Mission Aircraft, three helicopters, four unmanned aerial vehicles and sixteen armoured vehicles. Furthermore, to bolster intelligence gathering and sharing efforts, a command, control, computer communication and information centre (C4i) has also been set up in Kirikiri, Lagos. In a March 29 2021 article, Swim together or sink alone: African states unite to confront pirate threat writer Shola Lawal reported that ‘Nigeria’s Deep Blue Project (DBP), launched this year, is cautiously inspiring hope. The ambitious $195 million project aims to purchase assets like fast-intervention vessels, build interagency command centers for the country’s naval and port authorities, and train security forces.’ Chijioke Alozie reports in his seminal paper, Exploring Contemporary Sea Piracy in Nigeria, the Niger Delta and the Gulf of Guinea that the first serious effort in this area by any administration in Nigeria was when then President Yar’ Adua (2007-2010) appointed a Federal Minister of Niger Delta region to provide oversight into projects and people’s complaints, and above all, to be the Federal Government’s presence in the region. Successive governments have followed the historic pace set by Yar’Adua, by the appointment of a Federal Minister of Niger Delta. There is no record of purchase of any security hardware but efforts were essentially directed at pacifying the militants at the time. But in an attempt to fight maritime piracy, the government, in August 2014, appointed a one-time Niger-Delta warlord from Bayelsa State, General Boyloaf, as leader of a maritime security outfit in his home state of Bayelsa. It is worth remembering that Boyloaf once led an aggressive attack on a Shell oil platform 120 km (74 miles) offshore. In 2014 Boyloaf was quoted to have said, “the government was having serious security challenges in the creeks. They chose me to deal with it as the creeks are my terrain. I was born in the creeks, I fought against the government in the creeks, and I will now use that knowledge to hunt the pirates.” In all our investigation into the claim made by Mr Rotimi Amaechi, the Transportation Minister, there was no available record or document to indicate that the Obasanjo administration purchased security or military equipment to combat piracy on the Gulf of Guinea other than the October 2005 setting up of a Naval Base in Bonny. In all our findings, there was no budgetary allocation for the specific purpose of purchasing equipment, let alone a mention of spending of between €300 million and €400. Attempts were made to get Mr Amaechi to substantiate his claim with evidence. Text message sent to his phone number was not replied and repeated calls to the line were not answered. This writer also sent an email to the minister but got no response. There is no sufficient record to back the claim by Minister Rotimi Amaechi that the Obasanjo administration spent between €300 million and €400 million to buy equipment for safeguarding the maritime sector.

Claim: A Facebook user recently claimed that resting a laptop computer on the thigh or bare skin is hazardous to one’s health and can lead to skin cancer because of the “dangerous” emission.,"Claim: A Facebook user recently claimed that resting a laptop computer on the thigh or bare skin is hazardous to one’s health and can lead to skin cancer because of the “dangerous” emission.  There is no established scientific study connecting cancer with radiation emitting from a laptop. However, the radiation can alter testicular cells and contribute to male infertility, a health disorder leading to a man’s inability to cause pregnancy in a fertile female. A social media user, Hammed Yakub, in a Facebook post  on Saturday, July 10, issued a stern warning against consistent resting of laptop, a mobile personal computer (PC), on the laps or bare skin, arguing that it is dangerous to health. Although he did not support his claim with any established scientifically proven data, the social media user stated that men are mostly at risk because the radiation emitted from the PC is different from the known heat.  He said the heat may lead to skin cancer and infertility. He, however, advised that PC users should place their laptop on a desk instead of on the lap. “We need to be careful with some of the gadgets we use. Most of them are affecting our  health without us knowing. We face our phone every minute with uncontrolled brightness. Light from these phones is gradually damaging our sight. We need to watch our habit on laptop usage,” he claimed “For people, especially men placing their PC on the thighs and bare skin, they are likely to have skin cancer or at some point battle with infertility. The radiation from our laptops is not the usual heat. It is dangerous.  “We need to place our laptops on a flat desk first before placing it on our thighs. I don talk my own (I’ve said my own).” Due to the increase in the use of highly sophisticated gadgets in Africa, there has been a seemingly renewed call warning against placing laptops on the thighs and bare skin, with a number of unproven opinions submitting that users are open to various health hazards. One of all the health risks often touted is cancer. For instance, in its article titled “6 Reasons To NEVER Place Your Laptop on Your Lap,” a health blog, Vest Tech, claimed that radiation from PC does not only cause harm to the reproductive organ but also “develop into skin cancer.” The website cited a report by dermatologist Anthony J. Mancini, who claimed that “prolonged skin inflammation can potentially increase the chances of squamous cell skin cancer, which is more aggressive than the more common form of skin cancer.” While this has been staying for long, a research by Dubawa established that there is no connection between cancer and PC radiation. But what is cancer and PC? According to the National Cancer Institute, a website contributing to cancer research globally, cancer is a disease in which the body’s cells grow uncontrollably and spread to other parts of the body.  The health research hub stated that cancer can start almost anywhere in the human body, which is made up of trillions of cells.  Of course, under normal circumstances human cells grow and normally multiply to form new cells as the body needs them. When cells grow old or become damaged, they die, and new cells take their place. “Cancerous tumors spread into, or invade, nearby tissues and can travel to distant places in the body to form new tumors (a process called metastasis). Cancerous tumors may also be called malignant tumors,” the website further explained. The World Health Organisation (WHO) described cancer as a “large group of diseases that can start in almost any organ or tissue of the body when abnormal cells grow uncontrollably, go beyond their usual boundaries to invade adjoining parts of the body and/or spread to other organs.”WHO explained that the cancer burden grows globally because it “is the second leading cause of death globally, accounting for an estimated 9.6 million deaths, or one in six deaths, in 2018.” World Cancer Day, an initiative of the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC),  classified cancer as Carcinoma, Sarcoma, Lymphoma and Myeloma, Leukaemia and Brain and spinal cord cancers. The website attributed the causes of cancer to alcohol, obesity or being overweight, bad nutrition, lack of physical activities, Ionising radiation, infection and a bad environment. Ecommputers, a website that provides details about computers, described a laptop as a microprocessor technology that has been any small, relatively inexpensive computer designed to be used by one person at home or in an office. The typical personal computer assemblage, according to Britannica, consists of a “central processing unit (CPU), which contains the computer’s arithmetic, logic, and control circuitry on an integrated circuit; two types of computer memory, main memory, such as digital random-access memory (RAM). It also has an auxiliary memory, such as magnetic hard disks and special optical compact discs, or read-only memory (ROM) discs (CD-ROMs and DVD-ROMs); and various input/output devices, including a display screen, keyboard and mouse, modem, and printer.” Findings by Dubawa established that Laptops emit radio waves and other electronic signals known as Electro-magnetic radiation (EMRs) in various frequencies. This is extremely detrimental to the body as they cause discomfort when laptops are placed on bare skin. Prolonged exposure to these EMRs are known to cause a variety of other problems and disorders, one of them described as “toasted skin” by dermatologist and dermatosurgeon, Dr Shenaz Z Arsiwala. Despite this, there is no proven data that the EMRs radiation causes cancer.  According to Cancer Council Australia (CCA), a national organisation which aims to promote cancer-control policies and to reduce the illness caused by cancer in Australia, there is no link between using a portable (laptop) computer and cancer. In its response to numerous questions about cancer and PC, the institute explained there is no established research that cells can be damaged in the body due to PC radiation.  “While some studies show heat from various sources, not just laptops can affect a man’s sperm and fertility, there is no research linking heat from laptops to cell damage or cancer.  “There have been cases of “toasted skin syndrome” (mottled skin condition caused by long-term heat exposure) in people who used laptops resting on their legs for long periods,” the council submitted. When Dubawa contacted a health expert and dermatologist at the LAUTECH Teaching Hospital, Dr. Lukman Adefabi, it was explained that the only radiation that can cause cancer is x-ray which can lead to mutation or change in the cells structure. “Radiation can cause cancer but depending on the intensity of the radiation. When the intensity is accumulating in the cells, it can lead to cell mutilation (an alteration in the genetic material (the genome) of a cell of a living organism or of a virus). “When there is a high and uncontrolled rate of cell division or the cells being altered due to excessive and accumulated radiation, it results in cancer.” Dr Lukman explained that resting a laptop on bare thighs can lead to changes in the nature of the testis cells. This, according to him, can reduce sperm production—but it rarely leads to cancer (of testitis, not skin).  “Rarely it can cause cancer of that testis, but can change the nature of that testis due to accumulation of radiation in the testis,” he added. The testis, as defined by the Weil Cornell Centre for Male Reproductive Medicine and Microsurgery, is the male reproductive gland which is contained within a scrotum, which is an extension of the abdominal wall.  Hasmik Soloyan and Sargis Sedrakyan in their paper titled Encyclopedia of Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine published in 2019 stated that testes contain very fine-coiled tubes, called seminiferous tubules and are covered with tough membrane, tunica albuginea. Dr Adefabi submitted that radiation from the laptops cannot cause skin cancer as widely speculated. The exaggerated claim that emission from the PC can lead to cancer has been staying too long in the centre of discussion due to the rise in the number of PC users and access to various advanced gadgets. While there are different damages these gadgets can cause on our individual healths such as  male infertility, but when the testicular cells are damaged, there is no proof it causes cancer. The researcher produced this fact-check per the Dubawa 2020 Fellowship partnership with Legit.ng to facilitate the ethos of truth in journalism and enhance media literacy in the country.

"Claim: A Facebook user claims that the consumption of rotten tomatoes, popularly known as Esa in South-West Nigeria, can cause liver cancer.","A Facebook user, Adebisi Yusuff Adebayo, in a post, claimed that rotten tomatoes contain fungi which produce a toxin that may cause liver cancer. According to the post, boiling and frying it does not help remove the fungi completely.  It reads: “Share with others who buy spoilt tomatoes. Spoilt tomatoes (what Yoruba called Esa) contain a fungi that produces a toxin that may cause liver cancer. Don’t buy it because it is cheaper. “Note: Boiling and frying doesn’t completely remove the fungi. The fungi is known as Aspergillus while the toxin is known as Aflatoxins. Kindly inform others.” Over the years, there have been warnings on how these rotten tomatoes are dangerous to the health when consumed. In 2018, the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) warned Nigerians against the consumption of rotten tomatoes, to prevent cancer. Christiana Essenwa, a Deputy Director at the Agency who issued the warning, said rotten tomatoes contain microorganisms that induce cancer. In her words: “Some people think that rotten tomatoes, which are cheap, can be consumed after washing and heating, stressing that the toxins could not be washed or killed by heating since they are heat resistant.” A visit to some popular markets in Ibadan, Oyo State shows that many consumers still prefer the rotten tomatoes. Some of the traders and buyers who spoke to Dubawa explained that rotten tomatoes are quite cheaper than fresh tomatoes, adding that the rise in the price of fresh tomatoes had led to an increase in the preference for rotten ones. A buyer at one of the markets said: “Because of the increase in the price of fresh tomatoes, I now buy Esa, it is cheaper and higher in quantity.” When asked if she is aware these tomatoes are harmful to her health, she replied: “I wash them thoroughly and boil them for a long time.” A tomato seller also attributed the increase in consumer’s preference for rotten tomatoes to the hike in price of fresh ones. Dubawa then conducted a keyword search on the fungi, aspergillus and toxin, aflatoxins. According to Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), aspergillus is a common mold (a type of fungus) that lives indoors and outdoors. The CDC explained that most people breathe in aspergillus spores every day and it is probably impossible to avoid breathing in the fungi spores. This is not harmful for those with strong immune systems except people with weakened immune systems or lung diseases who are at a higher risk of developing health problems due to aspergillus. The types of health problems caused by aspergillus include allergic reactions, lung infections, and infections in other organs. The CDC says there are approximately 18 aspergillus fumigatus is the most common cause of human aspergillus infections. Aspergillus fumigatus is usually found in soil and decaying organic matter. In a published article by Oxford Academy,aspergillus fumigatus is known to produce various immunosuppressive mycotoxins. The World Health Organisation (WHO) defined mycotoxins as toxic compounds that are naturally produced by certain types of moulds (fungi), these moulds produce mycotoxins that  grow on variety of different crops and foodstuffs such as cereals, dried fruits, nuts and spices.  According to the World Health Organisation, aflatoxins are amongst the most poisonous mycotoxins which are produced by certain moulds; aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus, that grow in soil, decaying vegetation, hay, and grains. Crops that are frequently affected by aspergillus species include; cereals (corn, sorghum, wheat and rice), oilseeds (soybean, peanut, sunflower and cotton seeds), spices (chili peppers, black pepper, coriander, turmeric and ginger) and tree nuts (pistachio, almond, walnut, coconut and Brazil nut). The WHO also warned that the health effects of mycotoxins range from acute poisoning to long-term effects such as immune deficiency and cancer. Large doses of aflatoxins can lead to acute poisoning (aflatoxicosis) and they can cause liver cancer in humans. A nutritionist, Favour Akinpelu, said that consuming rotten tomatoes may increase the risk of liver cancer, adding that rotten tomatoes truly contain aflatoxins which are indeed damaging to the health. She said boiling and frying does not remove the fungi completely as consumers think. “Those white things found in rotten tomatoes are called aflatoxins which are indeed harmful and poisonous to humans.The effect of consuming this fungi may not happen immediately, it accumulates in the body and shows up later causing illnesses. “Some people think boiling and frying remove the fungi completely, but this is false. It is advisable to eat clean and healthy food that serves nutritional values,” she said Another expert, a medical doctor, John Ademola, explained that the issue of if the consumption of rotten tomatoes after cooking is harmful to humans is still equivocal. He explained that some studies have shown they are still harmful after cooking while some say they are not. He, however, advised that it is safer to consume fresh foods to avoid health complications. The claim that the consumption of rotten tomatoes can cause liver cancer is true. The WHO noted that consuming mycotoxins found in rotten tomatoes can lead to long-term effects such as immune deficiency and cancer.

Claim: Several Facebook users claim soldiers of the Nigerian Army intercepted a sand truck which concealed sophisticated weapons and ammunition allegedly billed for delivery to bandits in Birnin Gwari forest of Kaduna State.,"Claim: Several Facebook users claim soldiers of the Nigerian Army intercepted a sand truck which concealed sophisticated weapons and ammunition allegedly billed for delivery to bandits in Birnin Gwari forest of Kaduna State. This claim is false. Security agents have denied intercepting the truck and images of the cache of weapons that accompanied the story are recycled images that had appeared in 2013 and 2015.   On July 13, 2021, three pictures and a report appeared on Facebook with the claim that Nigerian soldiers intercepted a truck containing sand which concealed sophisticated weapons, including rocket propelled launchers and ammunition along the Kaduna-Birnin Gwari road. The lengthy post in Hausa and English soon gained traction and was shared several times by social media users.  The post stated that after evacuating the sand, the soldiers discovered over 6,000 ammunition, 34 AK-47 rifles, three rocket propelled launchers, six explosive vests and many other sophisticated weapons. It indicated that some very influential Nigerians were behind the transportation of the weapons. According to the report, the vehicle driver had confessed that he was paid N200,000 to convey the weapons to a forest in Birnin Gwari and hinted that his accomplices were trailing behind in a Toyota Highlander Jeep. The soldiers were said to have arrested five people from the jeep and with the driver, the six suspects were moved to a military facility in Kaduna for further questioning.   Abatam Nwosu with 3,918 friends on Facebook posted the message which was shared 22 times. The report and images were also circulated in Hausa by a Facebook user, Dahiru Mukhtar which was also shared 58 times from his timeline. On Instagram, a popular blogger Muhammad Auwal Muazu (@hausaa_fulani), who has 560,000 followers, also posted the report and images.     In all instances, the report was circulated with three pictures including that of the alleged truck that was intercepted and the cache of sophisticated weapons seized. The first image was that of the alleged truck with a red head and a white body. The picture which was taken at night appeared blurry. A Yandex image search and Tineye did not provide any information on the picture but a Google reverse image search only took this reporter to the same report and images on the alleged interception as published by other platforms.  Image two is that of a cache of sophisticated weapons including rocket propelled launchers. A Yandex reverse image search shows the image has appeared numerous times online. According to Time, the images are of weapons seized by the Nigerian forces from Islamist extremists group, Boko Haram in Borno State and displayed for the press on June 5th 2013. It credited the image to Quentine Leboucher/AFP. Further, i24 news also credited the same image to Quentine Leboucher/AFP and attributed the weapons to the ones displayed by Nigerian forces on June 5th 2013 after it seized them from Boko Haram.   Using Tineye, 78 results were provided for image three which first appeared online in 2018. Yandex reverse image search also shows that the image has been used by a lot of international media outfits to visualize stories on gun control.  A report by [email protected]: titled “Will ‘Red Flag’ gun laws prevent mass shootings?” Indicated that the weapons were seized by authority and shown at a news conference in Los Angeles on Tuesday, October 9th 2018. It also credited Jae C. Hong for the picture.   This image first appeared in 2018 and is credited to Jae C. Hong/AP The image was also used by Politico in the story: “Canada bans assault-style guns after Nova Scotia rampage,” while San Francisco Chronicle in its use of the image corroborated that they were illegally possessed firearms seized by authorities and shown at a news conference in Los Angeles on Tuesday, October 9, 2018. It also corroborated that the image was shot by Jae C. Hong of the Associated Press (AP). Security sources in Kaduna have denied the report, calling it Fake News. This reporter reached out to the spokesperson of the Nigerian Army 1 Division, Col. Ezindu Idimah, who said the report was fabricated as no such arrest was made. The Nigerian Police Command in Kaduna through the Public Relations Officer, ASP Mohammed Jalige, also said findings show no such arrests have been made within Birnin Gwari or Kaduna State. He said the report was fabricated and planted to achieve a mischievous agenda.        The report and images posted on social media depicting soldiers intercepting a sand truck concealing sophisticated weapons is misleading as two of the images used are recycled images that first appeared in 2013 and 2015 while there is insufficient evidence to trace the picture of the truck.

"Claim: A viral message on WhatsApp, and several other social media platforms claimed that hot coconut water cures all types of cancer.","A viral WhatsApp message had claimed drinking hot coconut water can cure all forms of cancer.  It advised  readers to add hot water to some thin slices of coconut flakes and the product  will become ‘alkaline water.’ The claim says hot coconut water releases ‘an anti-cancer substance’ that has served as a proven remedy to all types of cancer.  The message was said to have originated from Dr Abbas Hussain Kazmi of Sheikh Zaid Hospital although the location of the hospital (country) was not included. See the full message in the following screenshot: The Whatsapp message had also been visible on some websites. Coconuts, basically identified as fruits, are common in tropical areas throughout the world. Like every other fruit, the coconut has its health benefits; hence, it is not uncommon that such claims  surface.  Coconut water (coconut liquid endosperm) is the clear liquid found inside immature coconuts. It is the juice found in the centre of a young, green coconut that helps nourish the fruit. As the coconut matures, some of the juice remains in liquid form while the rest forms part of  the solid white flesh known as coconut meat.  It is necessary to note that Coconut water is different from coconut milk. Coconut milk is obtained by removing and grating the hard, white flesh and squeezing out the milky juice. Coconut water comprises 95% water with trace amounts of carbohydrates, proteins, oils, vitamins and minerals. There have been researches into the many benefits of coconut water, many of which have recognized its chemical properties. From previous studies, the chemical compositions of coconut water have been identified as Phytohormones  (a group of naturally occurring organic compounds that play crucial roles in regulating plant growth in a wide range of developmental processes). Coconut water is rich in carbohydrates and electrolytes such as potassium, sodium, and magnesium. Coconut water also contains water-soluble vitamins. In particular, Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) and a range of Vitamin B (B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, B7 and B9. Relatedly, a study has found that high plasma levels of vitamin B6 and folate may reduce the risk of breast cancer. Also, the presence of ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) in the natural coconut water was correlated with dietary antioxidant properties. The term “antioxidant” refers to any molecule capable of stabilizing or deactivating free radicals before they attack cells.  Free radicals are unstable atoms that can damage cells, causing illness and ageing. They produce progressive adverse changes that accumulate with age throughout the body. These could manifest as diseases at certain ages determined by some genetic and environmental factors. Cancer, a major cause of death, is a salient “free radical” disease.  With all of the above-listed components, other benefits of coconut water range from rehydration, though there is no sufficient evidence for this. A previous study had also tested the potency of coconut water in curing diabetes, albeit in rats.  At no point was coconut water mentioned as the sole remedy for all types of cancer.   Cancer is a disease that results when cellular changes cause the uncontrolled growth and division of cells. A cell receives instructions to die so that the body can replace it with a newer cell that functions better. Cancerous cells lack the components that instruct them to stop dividing and to die. According to a report by the World Health Organization, cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for nearly 10 million deaths in 2020. It identified the most common cases of cancer as breast cancer, lung cancer, colon and rectum cancer, prostate cancer, skin cancer, and stomach cancer.  Highlighting the risk factors of cancers, the report included tobacco use, alcohol use, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity; air pollution and chronic infections such as Helicobacter pylori, human papillomavirus (HPV), hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and Epstein-Barr virus (3). From the studies reviewed, the established methods of treatment of cancer include chemotherapy; hormone therapy; immunotherapy; precision medicine; radiation; stem cell transplant and surgery. A part of the claim also said adding coconut flakes to hot water makes it “alkaline water.” From checks by Dubawa, there is currently no scientific evidence to support the idea that alkaline water can either treat or prevent cancer.  When contacted, a hematologist, Madu Anazoeze, a hematologist at the Institute of Molecular Medicine and Infectious Diseases, University of Nigeria, Enugu Campus, said the message was a hoax as there was no single remedy for all types of cancer as there are different causes of each cancer type.  According to him, it is scientifically impossible to have such. He likened the coconut water to a multivitamin tablet, following its chemical compositions.  He warned that people with cancer should take their drugs and see their doctors.  He said, “It is difficult to have one thing that cures all types of cancer, that is almost impossible because different types of cancer have different things that cause them so somebody saying one single item can cure all cancers is almost impossible. I have never heard of this.  “I don’t trust such messages. The composition of the coconut water makes it just like a multivitamin tablet. I think bananas contain all these.  “Looking at it from the background of science, I don’t think it is possible. The method has to be put to test first, for people that are ready to take it when they have cancer but I don’t think that is true.  “It doesn’t make sense scientifically. I would advise people to take their drugs and see their doctors based on the kind of cancer they have. There is no single drug that cures every type of cancer, that is an impossibility.” A family medical practitioner, Segun Bankole, said such claims had better be debunked as it can cause a lot of dangers to people who are already treating cancers.  He stated that people in this category when exposed to such messages are likely to leave their normal drugs, stop going for their check-ups, and start taking this remedy. He observed that the claim is yet to be scientifically proven, urging any researcher who had successfully used this method to document methods and procedures used to achieve the result so that it can be replicated elsewhere with the exact same result.  He added, “Anyone that has cancer should go to the hospital and get properly checked, properly diagnosed and treated. Some cancers are curable, not all cancers are absolutely deadly. Instead of wasting time and taking coconut water, anyone could have written that piece and posted it online and people will start spreading it and that is very dangerous because the tendency is that people will leave their normal drugs, stop going for their check-ups and start taking this remedy.  “Those are dangerous things that should not be spread. I have seen a lot about fruits that people are claiming cures cancer but none of this has been medically proven.  “In medicine, if you do research and you get a result here in Nigeria, they must be able to do it exactly the same way and get the same result in England, Italy, it must be replicable. That’s what science is all about. The thing is, a lot of people have said many things about coconut water but I have not heard any claim of cancer cure or anything like that.  “Coconut water is healthy but not to cure cancer. It is unfounded, no one should believe it. There are different kinds of cancers and different methods to treat them, some are common with men, some are common with women. A medical practitioner will know how to classify everyone and treat them appropriately, not just going to take coconut water.” A Public Health expert, Jide Aremo, also said the claim is unproven and cannot be followed for lack of evidence.  “I understand the angle of trado-medicals on antioxidants, such as coconut water. It is believed that antioxidants kill free radicals. There seem to be a link that free radicals cause cancer but antioxidants actually mop up free radicals from the body but still, we have to analyse the composition of the coconut water, what does it contain and know if it is even safe for people with cancer.” Doing a keyword search, Dubawa observed that the same message had been circulated in 2019 and attributed to Dr Rajendra Badwe, Director of Tata Memorial Centre, one of the leading hospitals for cancer care in India. However, Badwe’s office debunked the statement, alienating the scholar from such claims.  It was also debunked by a Medical Oncologist in India, Manish Singhal. He said, “There’s news on coconut water that making it hot cures all types of cancer. “Coconut water is very good for the body, it helps keep you very hydrated but making it hot and then taking it and expecting that it will heal all the cancer types is not a correct statement. Please don’t try to do anything with this, it is so absurd.” Conclusion: Coconut water is said to be good for the body but has not been proven yet to be capable of curing any type of cancer. Also, information that coconut and hot water transform into alkaline water has been debunked. Cancer patients have been advised to see their doctors to know the best treatment method that suits their type of cancer.

CLAIM: Onitsha is the 3rd most populated city in Africa after Lagos and Cairo.,"CLAIM: Onitsha is the 3rd most populated city in Africa after Lagos and Cairo. The claim that Onitsha is the third most populated city in Africa is FALSE as the city is not  among the top five most populated Nigerian cities in 2021.  Africa is a continent that is rapidly expanding in terms of population, and this is reflected most clearly in its various sprawling urban populations.  Nigeria, with some notable large cities, is the 7th most populated country in the world.  A Twitter user Arum na-aso mkpali gwoo gwoo (@AfamDeluxo), on Wednesday, July 14, 2021, made a claim in a tweet that Onitsha in Anambra State, South-East Nigeria is the most populated city in Africa, after Lagos and Cairo.  He stated that the Northern population is a myth and that landmass does not equal human beings. He concluded the tweet by writing. “Festus Odumegwu who is the former chairman of National Population Commission uncovered the claim and wanted to fix it, but a former governor of Kano state, Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso and other Northern leaders fought him endlessly and made sure he was sacked.”  Screenshot of the tweets The tweet in less than 24 hours garnered a total of 1, 123 likes, 599 retweets and 33 quoted tweets.  One of those who saw the tweet posted a comment agreeing with the post, “I thought we all know this? …. exactly why they have been posing Kano (their headquarter for rigging elections) as the most populous after Lagos.  Screenshot of some comments affirming the claim Dubawa began its verification with a simple Google search engine to find out the most populous city in Africa. A post on the world population review recorded the current world population estimate in June 2019 to be 7,577,130,400 people, which far exceeds the world population of 7.2 billion in 2015.  Further search on world population review shows that Cairo, the capital of Egypt, was adjudged the largest city in Africa with the 2021 population now estimated at 21,322,750. Screenshot of Cairo’s population from 1950 Second is Kinshasa, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo, with a 2021 population now estimated at 14,970,460.  Screenshot of Kinshasa estimated population  It further stated that the estimate represents the Urban agglomeration of Kinshasa, which typically includes Kinshasa’s population in addition to adjacent suburban areas. Nigeria’s economic capital city of Lagos was listed as the third-largest city in Africa, with a population now estimated at 14,862,111. The population estimates and projections come from the latest revision of the UN World Urbanization Prospects.  Further findings also revealed that Onitsha is not even among the top five most populated Nigerian cities in 2021, with Lagos taking the lead followed by Kano with a population of 4,103,015, Ibadan has 3,649,023, Abuja has 3,464,123, closely followed by Port Harcourt with 3,171,076 while Benin City has 1,781,999. The city of Onitsha is the seventh most populous city in the country with 1,482,971. The total surface area of Nigeria is approximately 923,768 square kilometres. In combination with the over 200-million-person population, the density of Nigeria is around 212.04 individuals per sq km. Nigeria also has the highest population of any African nation, and much of this population resides in the south and southwestern area. Screenshot of Current Nigeria Population estimates  Given the evidence available, the claim that Onitsha is the third-largest city in Africa is FALSE and Misleading.

"Claim: A viral WhatsApp message encourages parents to deworm their children, implying that not doing so could lead to sudden death.","Deworming, according to Gi Doc is “the process of expelling intestinal worms or parasitic worms from the body by administering an anthelmintic medicine/drug.” Anthelmintic medicines/drugs are simply medications used to eliminate worms from the body. Deworming is also known as worming, drenching or dehelmintization. Worms are known as helminth parasites; they are of various types (like roundworms, tapeworms or flukes) and they affect humans (children/adults) as well as animals. Medical experts, therefore, encourage regular deworming to eliminate worms. Worms can be transmitted into the body by playing in the sand, through contact with worm infested poop, eating raw or infected food, not washing hands before eating, walking barefooted and not maintaining good hygiene. Worm infestation can affect individuals’ health and lead to serious complications, but can worm infestation cause sudden death? A WhatsApp message tells the story of how a Nigerian baby died at a general hospital due to worm infestation. The message then encourages residents of Oyo State in South West Nigeria to partake in the state government’s deworming exercise. The second to the last paragraph in the message claims that Oyo State was having a deworming exercise on that day (the day the copied message was posted) which was July 13, 2021. Dubawa searched online. Although there was information about deworming exercises in Oyo State, they were for previous years. This implies that the WhatsApp message might have been a recycled message from previous years. To ascertain the authenticity of the medical claims in the message, Dubawa reached out to two Consultant Public Health physicians.  Dr. Doyin Ogunyemi, Consultant Public Health Physician and a Senior Lecturer in the Department of Community Health and Primary Care, Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH), told Dubawa that the claims are exaggerated.  Deworming, Dr. Ogunyemi said, is important as it helps eliminate worms that, if left unchecked, “could cause stomach pains, fatigue, weakness, bloody stool, itching anus and signs of stunting and malnutrition. In severe cases, it may lead to intestinal obstruction requiring surgery” but worms on their own cannot lead to sudden death. She said what is likely to occur “is death occurring from complications of severe anaemia and intestinal obstruction, and these occur over a period of time and are very unlikely to cause death as depicted in the message.” Dr. Nasir Ariyibi, a Consultant Public Health Physician and the Medical Director of Lagos State University Health Centre, affirmed Dr. Ogunyemi’s position, noting that “WhatsApp stories are usually designed to cause panic while claiming to offer advice.” Dr. Ariyibi noted that the story does not add up and while doctors may note “likely cause of death,” they are unlikely to do so in the unprofessional manner depicted in the story. Dr. Ariyibi noted that worm infestation can also “cause schistosomiasis, blood in urine and some other forms of skin infections.” Schistosomiasis is a disease caused by freshwater parasitic worms that can enter the body and travel to different parts like the kidney and liver and cause great discomfort.  Dr. Ariyibi is also of the opinion that worm infestation (if not treated over a long time) can lead to serious complications, and it is those serious complications (if untreated) that can lead to death, “so it is not a linear process of worm infestation simply causing sudden death.” However, Dr. Ariyibi encouraged Nigerians to deworm themselves and children about twice a year or at least once a year and maintain good personal and environmental hygiene to prevent worm infestation, its complications and other diseases.  Regular deworming is encouraged as well as good hygiene, and worm infestation, if not treated early enough, could lead to serious complications. However, worm infection cannot simply lead to death as depicted in the WhatsApp story. ",message,17/07/2021,https://dubawa.org/can-worms-kill-children-as-claimed-in-this-viral-message/
Claim: A viral WhatsApp message claims WhatsApp has altered its privacy policy to offer government exclusive access to users’ privacy.,"A viral WhatsApp message claims that WhatsApp has changed its privacy policy to offer the government full access to users’ day-to-day privacy. The message warns users of this change as  follows: “Be mindful of your chats  Iᴍᴘᴏʀᴛᴀɴᴛ ɪɴғᴏʀᴍᴀᴛɪᴏɴ ᴀʙᴏᴜᴛ WʜᴀᴛsAᴘᴘ’s ɴᴇᴡ ʀᴜʟᴇs ᴛᴏ ɢʀᴏᴜᴘ ᴍᴇᴍʙᴇʀs … 1. ✓ = ᴍᴇssᴀɢᴇ sᴇɴᴛ.  2. ✓✓ = ᴍᴇssᴀɢᴇ ʀᴇᴀᴄʜᴇᴅ.  3.

While the origin of the message could not be traced to anyone in particular, its wide reach has captured the WhatsApp indicator for viral messages: “Forwarded multiple times.”  Social media is already a controversial topic in Nigeria, and its censorship, much to the dismay of the populace, has been pushed by the government as a viable policy.  Recently,  a total of N4.8 (4,870,350,000) billion naira was allocated to the National Intelligence Agency (NIA) to monitor WhatsApp messages, phone calls, text messages, among others. Perhaps it’s this turn of events that triggered the multiple shares of the acclaimed WhatsApp message in question.  After an advance search of the content of the message on the internet, results show that multiple fact checks have been conducted on the same claim. In fact, the same message has circulated across different countries.  In India, the message went viral attracting fact-checks  from IndiaToday and Times of India among others. It was widely   found to be false and misleading.  WhatsApp has also made its stance on the message,  debunking it with an official statement on its website. “We recently updated our Privacy Policy, and we have received many thoughtful questions. With some of the rumors going around, we want to answer some of the common questions we have received. We go to great lengths to build WhatsApp in a way that helps people communicate privately. We want to be clear that the policy update does not affect the privacy of your messages with friends or family in any way. The changes are related to optional business features on WhatsApp, and provide further transparency about how we collect and use data…read full here..“ DUBAWA also uncovered that WhatsApp has gone further to discredit the message and tagged it as ‘fake news’ on Twitter in January this year.  “We want to address some rumors and be 100% clear we continue to protect your private messages with end-to-end encryption.” To emphasize WhatsApp’s stance on the acclaimed message, Will Cathcart, Head of WhatsApp, added that: “Today we’re answering some common questions we’ve received @WhatsApp Our policy update describes business communication and adds transparency. It does not impact how people communicate privately with friends or family.”  “ Twitter’s policy on privacy remains ‘end-to-end encrypted.’ The viral claim is baseless and proved to be contrary to WhatsApp’s privacy policies.

"Claim: A message circulating on WhatsApp is asking Nigerians to apply for the Atiku Abubakar Empowerment Grant of N10,150 support fund via a website.","Claim: A message circulating on WhatsApp is asking Nigerians to apply for the Atiku Abubakar Empowerment Grant of N10,150 support fund via a website. Findings have shown that the  message circulating on WhatsApp, asking Nigerians to apply for the Atiku Abubakar Empowerment Grant  of N10,150 support fund via a website, is a click bait and fraudulent. A viral message is making the rounds on WhatsApp, urging Nigerians to apply for the  N10,150 support fund courtesy of the former Vice President of Nigeria, Atiku Abubakar. The message directed readers to a free URL shortener, bit.ly. The message reads: *ATIKU Empowerment 2021* *Hurry Now and Check if You are Eligible to Receive N10,150 Support Fund As Part Of ATIKU Empowerment Grant.* _This Grant Is Available To All Nigerians_  _Apply Here_ bit.ly/ATIKU-YOUTH-EMPOWERMENT” First of all, the message contained grammatical errors and  irregular capitalisation of certain letters that cast doubts on its authenticity. Dubawa provided a wrong name, state, gmail, phone number in order to access the other pages of the form and it redirected this reporter to a new page. The second page reads: “Congratulations You have been selected to benefit from the support Fund Payment provided by ATIKU FOUNDATION. [1]    [1] Answer the following three questions to benefit immediately! What is your Employment Status? What Is Your Marital Status? Choose Your Age Range?”  This reporter was thereafter asked to share the information with 15 friends or five groups in order to get the application letter, and under the message beneficiaries were seen testifying on how real the project is. The notification reads: “After considering your answers, your support fund amount is set to N100,000 and complete the steps to obtain the withdrawal code from the electronic counter -You may get the support fund with only one step, kindly click the “Invite Friends/Group” button below to share this information with 15 friends or 5 groups on WhatsApp so That They Can Also Benefit. Share it until the blue bar is full! -After sending the invitation, click the “Get withdrawal code” button: Note: If you do not complete this step correctly, you will not get the Support Fund every Week.” A screenshot of the page asking users to share information An analysis with Domainbigdata, a web tool used to look for the website ownership, revealed that the website has hidden information and the IP address also shows it has been reported several times for abuses, fraud, and attacks. Dubawa also observed that every visit to the website during this search in the last few days, there was a banner reading “This Offer Is Available Till 30th AUGUST 2021 So Far, 113624 Nigerians Have Benefited From This Offer. You Can Also Benefit. Apply Now and Follow Instructions”,  while the countdown was reading, creating a sense of urgency. So Dubawa conducted a word search on the Atiku empowerment, and it shows that the former Nigeria’s vice president Atiku Abubakar  has dissociated himself from the Atiku Foundation Youth Empowerment Fund, thereby urging Nigerians to disregard any fraudulent message from the platform. Atiku debunked the claim through his spokesperson, Paul Ibe, on the Atiku Care Foundation – Legal Department page on Facebook, on the 13th of July. In his words “We warn supporters of Atiku Abubakar and the general public not to patronize any portal called Atiku Foundation for Youth Empowerment.” Since Dubawa has fact checked several websites with similar profile, Dubawa decided to consult a techie, the founder, Zhibodigital Web Solutions, Joey Shekwonuzhibo,  to understand the reappearance of the website  in different forms, who said that URL shortener is used to make the address of a web shorter, examples are: (bit.ly, tinyURL, bl.ink, short.io, shorby, sniply) and the likes. “These links that are shortened could be misleading and if you’re not careful, you’d fall prey, sometimes, people use it for click bait, but it can be used for data analysis, on any of the link shortener sites, they give you analytics of how many people clicked, their devices, location, gage range all” Shekwonuzhibo added He went on to advise the public to use a website checker, Google or random word search to verify credible websites. Verification has shown that the  message circulating on WhatsApp, asking Nigerians to apply for the Atiku Abubakar empowerment grant  of N10,150 support fund, via a website is fraudulent and misleading.

Claim: A WhatsApp video that has been forwarded many times in Nigeria (with an accompanying message) depicts the unlawful arrest of a United States Police Sheriff’s Black son by racist police officers for driving slowly.,"Nigerians are familiar with reports of police brutality against people of colour in the United States of America, particularly Blacks. The unfortunate death of George Floyd, who was killed during an arrest in 2020 is just a little over a year, and countless records of police brutality have since been recorded. Another Black man, Dante Wright, was killed by the police during a traffic stop on April 11, 2021. This probably explains why many Nigerians were interested in the alleged video of a White and racist U.S. police officer who was humiliated for wrongfully arresting a Black man for driving slowly. Verification After watching the video, Dubawa realised that the camera shots as well as the plot did not appear like that of a true event. Dubawa collected screenshots from the viral video and ran them through available reverse image tools. While the process was futile, a keyword search conducted also did not yield any result. Since the video carries a Tiktok user’s ID, Dubawa traced the 1 minute 20 seconds video to the Chinese App popular for sharing short videos.  There, Dubawa found that the video was the third part of a five-part video shared by a TikTok user with the user name @nuella_official. She wrote her name as Århmãh Êmøjí on her TikTok account, which has over 37,000 followers and more than half a million likes on TikTok.  . From the comment sections (which harbour over 1000 comments) on the 5 videos, there are arguments over the genuineness of the video. While some think the video was from a real-life event, others believe it was staged.  Dubawa furthered its search and discovered that the video does not depict a true event. The video is an excerpt from a 2021 short film titled “Traffic Stop Gone Wrong”. The video has only four cast members. Verne Alexandre acted the role of Captain James Porter, Brewer Daniels is the racist officer – Sergeant Mike Green, Gabriell Salgado is the Rookie Officer while the role of the Captain’s son was performed by Dondre Tuck. The video is thus a short film with didactic plots and a device to address the ills of racism in established institutions in the United States of America. The shared video does not depict reality, it is a short film. kudos Dubawa team! ",Wrong,16/07/2021,https://dubawa.org/no-u-s-police-did-not-arrest-sheriffs-son-for-being-black/
"Claim: A viral newslink, forwarded many times on WhatsApp, claims the Federal Government has declared July 20 to 22, 2021 as public holidays for Nigerians to celebrate Eid-ul-Adha","Eid-ul-Adha is one of the two most important festivals for Muslims the world over, especially in Nigeria which has a significant Muslim population. The date of the Eid-ul-Adha Festival is however not fixed because Muslims use the Hijrah (Lunar) Calendar which is not always equivalent to the Gregorian Calendar. Muslim faithfuls, therefore, count the Lunar Calendar and await Islamic leaders’ declaration of the dates they will perform significant spiritual events.  In Nigeria, the Sultan of Sokoto and President-General, Nigerian Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs (NSCIA), Alhaji Sa’ad Abubakar III, has declared Tuesday, July 20, 2021 (which is equivalent to 10th of Dhul-Hijja 1442AH) as the day of Eid-ul-Adha for the year. Muslim faithfuls and all Nigerians have therefore been expecting the federal government to declare public holidays to enable them celebrate.  While the usual practice is for the Federal Government to declare two work-days as public holidays, Nigerian Muslims, especially those who travel far for those celebrations always wished for more days. This probably explained why many people shared the message when they saw a news link suggesting that the Federal Government has declared three days for holidays, instead of the usual two days. Dubawa received a message that had been tagged ‘Forwarded many times’ by WhatsApp, stating that the Federal Government had declared July 20, 21 and 22 as Eid-ul-Adha holidays. Dubawa clicked on the news website link in the WhatsApp message (westerndailynews.com) but kept getting error messages despite trying several times. Dubawa also searched all of the Federal Government’s social media website and did not see any message on the alleged declaration. Dubawa reached out to the Ministry of Interior and the staff who spoke on the condition of anonymity (because he was not authorised to talk) said the viral message is false, the Ministry will announce the public holiday later in the afternoon of July 15, 2021 and that it will likely be just two days (July 20 and 21, 2021). The viral WhatsApp message claiming that Nigeria’s Federal Government has declared three days (July 20-22) for the 2021 Eid-ul-Adha is false and misleading.

Claim: A screenshot making rounds on social media claims that acclaimed evidential photos of items collected from Sunday Igboho’s house by DSS were from 2013.," A viral screenshot of a Facebook post making rounds on social media claims that the alleged pictures of items recovered and presented by the Department of State Security (DSS) from Sunday Igboho’s house were pictures from 2013 and not recent.  The screenshot was said to have emerged from  Rotimi Adebuji’s Facebook timeline, in a post he made back in 2013.  The claim implies that the pictures presented by DSS were simply being reused to paint a false narrative against Sunday Igboho.  Sunday Igboho, a Yoruba based activist, who was declared wanted after the alleged arms were recovered from his house was planning for a mass rally in Lagos before the incident took place.  The alleged screenshot was shared multiple times across different social platforms and seemed to have attracted a massive traction. A user, who shared it on his WhatsApp status, told DUBAWA that: “you cannot trust the government, I am sure these pictures are from 2013. They can not deceive us, the truth is out.”   Such claims are potent enough to cause rancour and arouse chaos in the society. As such, DUBAWA opted to verify the authenticity of the alleged screenshot.  First, DUBAWA launched an analysis of the Facebook timeline which the screenshot was said to have emerged from. Results uncovered neither traced the acclaimed post within the alleged time frame offered (2013) nor was the post  found to have been made, but  then deleted within the alleged time frame. It was however, noticed, that the alleged user, Rotimi Adebuji, whose screenshot is referenced, actually made a similar post with the same pictures, but it was recent, on July 2nd, 2021 and not back in 2013 as alleged.  The above finding further led DUBAWA to conduct an analysis of the alleged screenshot. Results show that the screenshot was fake, as it was merely created by an online tool called, “prank me not”. The tool allows users to: “Build your own fake Facebook Status and prank your friends. You can change ANYTHING, use emoticons and even upload your own profile photos for post and comments. This generator is in no way associated with Facebook. All graphical material is protected by the copyright owner. May only be used for personal use.” Even more, other red flags identified indicate a disparity with Facebook standard operations for uploading pictures per album. While Facebook only allows 1000 per album, the acclaimed screenshot showed a total of 5529-plus pictures uploaded on the same album. Also, one alarming fact is that  the post dated back to 2013, did not attract a single reaction and had only one share, an uncommon reality when compared with other posts on the acclaimed users timeline that has not less than 100 plus reactions and shares within days.  DUBAWA has also contacted Mr. Rotimi on Facebook to verify from him the source of the screenshot but he is yet to reply.  To further prove that the picture was designed to malign the DSS another screenshot, this time just a single image of the photo showing charms and guns also had no share unlike the other version of the alleged picture which had one share. Also, the comment “I COME IN PEACE “ is not only a presumed mindset but maliciously written to misinform and sarcastically implied to mislead. The alleged screenshot dating back the pictures presented by the DSS is fake. The post could not be traced within the time frame of the alleged user’s Facebook timeline. This claim is misleading, and should therefore be disregarded.

Claim: A WhatsApp message (with attached images) claims Nigerian bandits now wear cow hooves padded sandals to deceive soldiers about their movement.,"The security situation in Nigeria is dire, with various armed groups like the Boko Haram terrorists, kidnappers and bandits wreaking havoc on citizens, particularly in the Northern part of the country. Sadly, The activities of bandits have currently reached an all time high, with incessant kidnappings of students and politically exposed individuals for ransom and the destruction of lives and properties of helpless villagers. It is therefore not out of place for Nigerians to be interested in their tricks and activities. Recently, a message has gone viral on the social media in Nigeria, claiming bandits now wear cow-hooves padded sandals to deceive soldiers about their movements.

Claim: Using phones in a fuel station or near fuel at home can cause an explosion.,"Since the introduction of mobile phones to Nigeria, many people believe that using phones at a filling station can cause explosions. Different messages are churned out year after year about the danger of not switching off your phones at filling stations and reasons why phones should not be used in the kitchen.  A number of news reports had reported cases where use of phones while using the generator had caused a fire explosion. Although there have been no reported cases of mobile phones  causing explosions at fuel stations in Nigeria, there have been some cases in foreign countries. A news report  read, “Tragedy struck in Agege area of Lagos State, South West Nigeria when a staff of Fidelity Bank PLC was burnt to death while trying to switch on a generating set which caught fire when a call came in his GSM handset. “We gathered that the victim, Mr. David Adeogun, got married not too long ago and had a new baby. “Investigations revealed that Adeogun, a staff of the Ikosi, Ketu branch of the bank got home after work and wanted to switch on the generating set with the torchlight on his phone when the phone rang, The generating set was said to have exploded immediately when the phone rang. His body, it was learnt.” There have also been multiple reports, especially YouTube videos that show that mobile phones cause explosions. A visit to a number of filling stations shows that many filling stations still express a certain level of caution to prevent fire outbreak or explosion. Some of the safety rules at filling stations reads; ‘No smoking, stop your machine, switch off your phone amongst many others.’ A mobile phone is a wireless handheld device that allows users to make and receive calls. While the earliest generation of mobile phones could only make and receive calls, today’s mobile phones do a lot more, accommodating web browsers, games, cameras, video players and navigational systems. Also, while mobile phones used to be mainly known as “cell phones” or cellular phones, today’s mobile phones are more commonly called “smartphones” because of all of the extra voice and data services that they offer. According to fossbytes.com,there are a myriad number of smartphones available today, it’s all a game of different designs, features, cameras, display quality, performance, battery life and numerous other things that consumers are looking for. However, what goes on beneath these mobile computing machines is equally important because if you’re knowledgeable in this aspect, then you can come close to making a purchasing decision less excruciating down the road. Major components of a mobile phone includes;  A circuit board containing the brains of the phone An antenna A liquid crystal display (LCD) A keyboard (not unlike the one you find in a TV remote control) A microphone A speaker A battery Petroleum, or crude oil according to petroleum.co.uk, as it is now usually referred to when raw, contains several chemical compounds, the most prolific being the hydrocarbons themselves which give the petroleum composition its combustible nature. Although the composition of petroleum will contain many trace elements the key compounds are carbon (93% – 97%), hydrogen (10% – 14%), nitrogen (0.1% – 2%), oxygen (01.% – 1.5%) and sulphur (0.5% – 6%) with a few trace metals making up a very small percentage of the petroleum composition. The actual overall properties of each different petroleum source are defined by the percentage of the four main hydrocarbons found within petroleum as part of the petroleum composition. The percentages for these hydrocarbons can vary greatly, giving the crude oil a quite distinct compound personality depending upon geographic region. These hydrocarbons are typically present in petroleum at the following percentages: paraffins (15% – 60%), napthenes (30% – 60%), aromatics (3% to 30%), with asphaltics making up the remainder. Over the years, there have been controversies around whether the use of mobile phones cause fire explosions at filling stations or while pouring fuel in the generator at home.  Many messages have gone viral on various social media platforms stating why using phones while in contact with petrol can ;lead to fire explosions.  However, a quick check by The Punch, revealed that there is no direct link between usage of phone and fire when one is near a fuel or filling station.  In a phone interview with The Punch, a professor of Communication Engineering, Prof Francis Idachabba, explained that there is no direct link between phones causing fire explosions at filling stations while pouring fuel in the generator.  He said, “It’s not likely that a fire would happen while using your phone at a filling station. An explosion won’t happen unless there is a contact between the fuel and fire”  Debunking the myths that when phones get too hot it might cause a fire,  the professor said, “The manufacturers have specifications. For mobile phones to generate so much power to the extent that it would cause fire in a petrol station is a claim that is unfounded. “The technology for phones and fuel are very different. They are on separate arcs. Nobody has shown any proof that  using a mobile phone at a filling station can cause it.Technically too from the place I am seeing it, the relationships are very far apart.” Idachaba stated that if phones could exhibit such a level of danger, the manufacturers wouldn’t have allowed it in the marketplace.  He stated, “ Most of these devices are ensured not to cause these things. If phones have the capacity to cause explosions like that, I am sure the use of the phone will be limited and such precautions would have been given by the manufacturers.All these are presumptions that have not been validated to the best of my knowledge.”  Talking about fire explosions while using the generator, the engineering don said that it was important to observe the condition with which the fire explosion happened. Idachaba stated, “It is important to note the condition which the generator was in rather than just generalising. Was the generator on  while they were pouring the fuel inside the generator? Because if the generator is on it will be hot and petrol and heat are not very friendly.  And that is why you are usually told not to switch on your engine while topping it up. “For the generator, it should be switched off and allowed to cool off before the fuel is poured inside because the exhaust is usually very hot. But to suggest that using a phone as a torchlight to pour fuel in the generator would cause a fire is very unlikely.”  Idachabba said that for a phone that is not in use to generate heat that could cause an explosion is almost impossible just as it is still not likely when in use.  He stated, “When you  are holding your phone and not making a call, it does nothing. What happens while using your phone is what we call status update,  the updates are sent from the phone to the nearest GPS intermediately. “To say that a phone that is not in will cause a fire is a little far-fetched, it should not. This is engineering but except the conditions that can make room for such. “But, I have not seen and there is no empirical fact to show that using a phone torchlight while pouring fuel in the generator will cause fire. I haven’t seen that before. It is not straightforward like that but there are chances that it can happen under certain conditions.” In the same vein, an oil and gas analyst, Bala Zakk,a also explained the components of fuel and the process of distillation while analysing if phones were capable of causing fuel at fire stations.  He said, “When we talk about crude oil generally , we are talking about fossil fuels. During distillation for refining,they come out based on their specific gravity or weight. And when these products start coming out based on their weight or gravity. The lighter the product, the more flammable it becomes.  “In other words, gas is lighter than petrol,petrol is lighter than diesel and kerosene while they are lighter than Bitumen. The lighter the products, the more inflammable  or dangerous it would be when it comes close to a source of fire.  “That is why when you see a case of gas tanker fire it is more deadly than that of petrol and petrol is more dangerous than that of diesel and kerosine. When you talk about these petroleum product, the only thing that will generate friction between them is friction that would generate light not electricity “Electricity is different from the kind of light that will generate flame. It is different from a friction that generates heat that would produce a flame. So, there is no relation between using a phone and causing a fire at a fuel station.”  The petroleum analyst said that there was however a slim chance if there was a spark from the electricity which could generate fire. Zakka added, “However, a spark from the phone as a result of electrical charges can cause flame and when you have a source of gas, petrol or other products depending on how flammable they are,  then you can have an explosion. Fuel and phones are two different products, phones can’t  cause fire.  “Phones function based on what we know as electrical charges, the electrical charges don’t generate normal flames but when there is a spark, like when you put two batteries together and it produces a spark, then we can have a flame.  “A car battery is a good example, a car battery does not cause fire, it powers a car to move but when you now put the heads of a battery together, it would generate a spark. If there is no source of generating a spark, then a phone can never generate a spark that would cause fire.  “What is being done at the filling station is a case that I will call prevention is better and cheaper than cure.  It is better to prevent it than look for medicine to cure it after the explosion.”  Using phones near petrol and other petroleum products does not cause fire as opposed to the general belief but there is a likelihood if there is an electrical spark.

Claim:  An online news medium on Instagram claimed taking large doses of paracetamol in a carbonated drink is damaging to the liver,"On July 1, 2021, an online news medium on Instagram  instablog9ja posted some pictures of a post by a Twitter user, Sub-pharmacist( @Tobenna__)  on the supposed danger faced by three friends who overdosed on paracetamol. According to the post, taking large doses of paracetamol in a day is already dangerous and putting it in a carbonated drink even makes it more damaging. The post added that paracetamol is broken down in a toxic metabolite which is still cleared by the liver and taking high doses of paracetamol results in accumulation of this toxic metabolite to a level the liver can handle. And this leads to the damage of liver cells and this damage becomes extensive and results in liver failure. The post as of July 3 had garnered 19,880 likes and 1,725 comments. In a published article, a  general surgeon, Dr Binita Priyambada says paracetamol is a generic name and is used as an ingredient in a certain group of medicines intended to work as a painkiller, anti-inflammatory drugs. Also, the drug carries antipyretic properties and hence prescribed or combined in the medicine which is used to reduce fever. Meanwhile, information on a certified Paracetamol patient information leaflet shows that the drug is used to treat pain (including headache, toothache, back and period pain) and cold or flu symptoms.  The active substance is paracetamol and other ingredients are, maize starch, potassium sorbate, purified talc, stearic acid, povidone, and soluble starch. Paracetamol is also available as tablets or caplets, capsules, liquid-usually for children, soluble tablets (tablets that dissolve in water to make a drink), suppositories and an injection into the vein-normally only used in hospitals. Users were asked to take special check with doctors before taking paracetamol if: 1.       They have severe Kidney or Liver problems. 2.       They have a liver problem caused by alcohol. Users were also advised against drinking alcohol whilst taking the drug, as taking alcohol with paracetamol can increase one’s chance of getting side effects. The medical dictionary defines carbonated drink as a fluid infused with carbon dioxide and consumed for hydration or refreshment, such as Coca-Cola or other soft drink. According to a publication by  Harvard University’s School of Health carbonated drinks which are also categorized as sugar-sweetened beverages or ‘soft’ drinks refer to any beverage with added sugar or other sweeteners (high fructose corn syrup, sucrose, fruit juice concentrates, and more).  This includes soda, pop, cola, tonic, fruit punch, lemonade, sweetened powdered drinks as well as sports and energy drinks. As a category, these beverages are the single largest source of calories and added sugar in the world’s diet. So, is taking large doses of paracetamol with carbonated drinks really dangerous to the liver? Spokesperson for the Association of Community Pharmacists of Nigeria (ACPN), Adebola Lawal, said taking large doses of paracetamol with carbonated drinks is indeed damaging to the liver adding that drugs are meant to be taken with water. He said carbonated drink is almost a drug itself and when taken together with paracetamol, the liver is made to work more in eradicating what it terms as waste thereby causing a severe problem to it. “Drugs are meant to be taken with water and not with any form of drinks, because the drink(either alcoholic or carbonated) is also a drug on its own. So, the liver has to go through a process called Metabolism to process it before it gets to the site of action. Therefore, it is absolutely true that when drugs are taken with carbonated drinks, one is bound to exert the liver,” he said. Another pharmacist and a member of the Pharmaceutical Society of Nigeria (PSN), Abiodun Ayeku, said paracetamol when taken in large doses has an effect on the liver  whether taken with any drink or not. “As a matter of fact, paracetamol when taken in large dose alone has an effect on the liver, a situation referred to as Hepatotoxicity, and whether taken with any drink or not, if one is taking paracetamol beyond the prescribed dose, it definitely has an effect on the liver. “This is because paracetamol is metabolic and is broken down in the liver. Basically, regardless of taking the drug with carbonated drinks, taking it in a large dose in the first place is harmful to the liver,’ he stated. He added that the liver has to work extra hard to break down the carbonated drink and as such it is better that people avoid things that make the liver work more than its capacity. Taking large doses of paracetamol has a damaging effect on the liver in the first instance and when combined with carbonated drinks, the liver has to exert itself to break down its content and this has a damaging effect on it.

Elizabeth Ogunbamowo,"Elizabeth Ogunbamowo Claim: A viral video resurfaced on Wednesday, 30th June 2021 claiming members of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) staged a mass protest against the recent rearrest of their leader, Nnamdi Kanu. It showed IPOB members displaying their flags and chanting war songs. The viral video is misleading as it is a 2015 video which resurfaced and is being circulated to sell a narrative that IPOB members constituted a nuisance after the arrest causing a lot of gridlock in Port Harcourt.    On Tuesday, 29th June 2021, the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, announced the re-arrest of Nnamdi Kanu, leader of separatist group, Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB). Malami said Kanu was intercepted through the collaborative efforts of Nigerian Intelligence and Security Services on Sunday 27th June.  He said Kanu had been brought back to Nigeria in order to continue facing trial for 11-count charge against him after jumping bail in 2017. Kanu was first arrested in Nigeria on October 14, 2015, following years of his campaign for the sovereign state of Biafra. He was granted bail in April 2017 but fled the country after soldiers invaded his residence in Abia state during a military clampdown on IPOB members. While on the run, the separatist leader piloted the affairs of IPOB from abroad. His rearrest had sparked heated reactions across the country’s political landscape, particularly among those backing activities of IPOB.  Not long after Kanu’s rearrest, social media users started sharing a video of IPOB members protesting on a street in Port Harcourt and causing a lot of unrest linking it to the warning. Former Aviation Minister, Femi Fani-Kayode, took to his Facebook page to share the same video with the caption, “Marching for Nnamdi! I repeat this man must not die in detention.” The post has since gathered over 6,000 likes on the platform with 4,000 shares.  He also shared the video on Twitter and it had raked in over 1,900 retweets and 2, 600 likes as of the time of Tuesday, June 6. On Youtube, the video has also been shared by some pages such as an online blog titled ‘Daily Post,’ a mimicry of the original news medium, Daily Post. This blog, a pass off of Daily Post, also published a story to this effect on its website. Other Youtube Channels on which this video was shared include: Ikeja Online Tv, Biafra Channel TV,  Val Obi Channel among many others.  Dubawa observed that the video that has gone viral on social media appeared in various lengths. One was 8 minutes 22 seconds long while another appeared in 4 minutes 25 seconds; another version which was shared was 4 minutes, 38 seconds. The video showed protesters who appeared to be members of IPOB in vehicles and on foot en masse on the streets with the Biafran flag. A YouTuber who shared the video on June 30, said in the background, “It is happening right now in Igweocha Rivers State, Igweocha is boiling right now, our people brothers and sisters have come out to protest the arrest of our great leader. Zoo government can’t silence us, no they can’t do that, we can’t be discouraged, Biafra is here. We are here.”  Forty seconds into the video, a man and a lady could be heard in the background shouting. “Nna eh (Igbo word meaning Father), e dey happen for Port Harcourt oh, Biafra, Biafra, here we are, O boy see the crowd. This is the state of Biafra at Igweocha. They want to bring down the Nigeian flag, this is Biafran land. Yes, this is Biafra! Biafra, here we are, at Igweocha, declare the state of Biafra. They have removed the Nigerian flag. For Buhari to tamper with Nnamdi Kanu, he is finished. Buhari must obey Biafra.” Dubawa also observed an icon at the right-hand corner of the video which represents that of a video editing app, Kine Master. The Youtuber used this video editing app, Kine master to select and edit the videos. Another Youtuber, Val Obi, rotated the same video before posting on his channel. While the original version of the video and other copies of the video showed a red truck on the left-hand side of the recorder, this YouTuber changed the view to the right hand. He claims, “There is rioting at the moment in the city of Igweocha Port Harcourt following the arrest and detention of Mazi Kanu.” From checks, the video had originated in 2015. One of the YouTube channels, NNTV – Africa posted the video as far back as October 31, 2015, in three parts. Part one of the video is what has been copied and recirculated as a recent video. IPOB had earlier in a statement issued on 30th of June had urged its members to remain calm and had only declared that its members will flood Abuja for Kanu’s trial on July 26 and 27 as stated.  The statement issued by the group’s spokesman Emma Powerful had read, “…Our leader Mazi Nnamdi Kanu is presently in the custody of the Nigerian Government. This evil crime of kidnapping was masterminded by the Nigerian Government in collaboration with all those that view IPOB and Mazi Nnamdi Kanu as a stumbling block against their bid to hold Biafra in perpetual slavery. “We, therefore, enjoin every IPOB member both at home and in the Diaspora and all Biafrans to remain calm because this is not the end of the road. Our leader’s next court appearance is July 26, 2021, and Biafrans should mobilize and attend the court hearing.” This reporter observed the picture quality of the video was not in a very high resolution.  With the InVID verification Plugin, the reporter used the analysis tab to get fragments (images) from the video.   The reporter further used the available reverse image search engines such as TinEye, Google image reverse search, and Yandex on the fragments produced. While Yandex did not produce any useful results, Google reverse image search showed that the video had been posted several times in the last few days on Facebook, online platforms with most results showing YouTube videos.  One of the search results showed the same video uploaded on October 21, 2015 titled ‘IPOB Biafra Burning Nigeria Flags in Port Harcourt’.  TinEye produced about four matches for the video when a keyframe analysis was conducted showing the same videos being uploaded in 2016 and 2019. Using the keyframe tab, InVID also allowed for a video fragmentation, where the reporter selected keyframes and with a right-click, more search engines were made available for reverse image search.  With this, the Bing search engine brought up the same result of the video uploaded on October 21, 2015 titled ‘IPOB Biafra Burning Nigeria Flags in Port Harcourt’.  A keyword search on YouTube also led to the video which was posted on October 31, 2015 on NNTV-Africa titled, ‘Biafra Restoration, Nnamdi Kanu’s Arrest: IPOB Protest in Igweocha (Port Harcourt) Rivers State Part 1” This Fact check concludes that the viral video of protesters carrying the Biafran flag also with leaves chanting war songs is misleading as the video first appeared online in 2015. Therefore, the video could not have been connected to a recent protest against the rearrest of Nnamdi Kanu in the South-South.

Claim: A sponsored page on Facebook with the name “BBC News Nigeria” is seeking Nigerians’ audience and asking them to invest their money for a double return on their investment.,"Claim: A sponsored page on Facebook with the name “BBC News Nigeria” is seeking Nigerians’ audience and asking them to invest their money for a double return on their investment. The page is not owned by BBC or Vanguard as its owner wants the social media audience to believe. Besides, there is nothing like “BBC News Nigeria” whether as an existing entity or  as a media house in Nigeria. The “BBC New Nigeria” page is fake. A fraudulent group which identified itself as “CROWD 1” has been calling on Nigerians to “register and invest” their money, promising higher Return on Investment (ROI). The group, which claimed it was created to provide support “both for the rich and poor” in order to help them “financially” is running its fraudulent activities with a sponsored Facebook page identified as “BBC News Nigeria.” While assuring that investment is “100% money secured”, the page is directing interested users to join a Whatsapp group or call the admin of the “investment scheme.” “WELCOME TO CROWD 1. To Register And Invest Click The WHATSAPP BUTTON To message CROWD 1 OR Click on the link below to message them on WhatsApp👇👇 https://wa.me/2347069309314?text=Hello!%20Please%20how%20does%20this%20platform%20Works Call/WhatsApp The Admin (07069309314). “They are 100% money secured!!! It was created to support financially is both for the rich and poor,” the post of the group read accompanied with the video showing John Okafor, a Nigerian comic thespian, popularly known as Mr Ibu. Dubawa conducted an overall check on the page and discovered that contrary to its name “BBC News Nigeria”, it is not an original BBC News page or a media company. Besides, there is no single report except two videos — one of them showing a Nollywood actor, Kelvin Ikeduba, explaining why people should invest their money. The actor, arguably, is serving as an ambassador of the ponze group identified as “Crowd 1 investment.” This is a known culture in Nigeria whereby celebrities and social media influencers are used to sell a product, promote brands or project or change people’s orientation towards an opinion, idea and ideology.  When Dubawa checked the photo section of the page, three pictures bearing “Breaking News” were found. One of them has a striking resemblance to BBC News, a global digital news and broadcasting agency. While it is apparently clear that the page does not belong to the real BBC, its owner, Crowd 1, uses the media organisation’s image and logo brand to serve as a clickbait. This, it is assumed, will draw the attention of targeted social media audiences to the page. Similarly, the fraudulent attempt is to give the ponzi scheme’s page a credibility boost, make people believe that it is owned by BBC News and lure them to the videos which, perhaps, may convince them to join the investment group. Dubawa notes there is no media agency in Nigeria with the name “BBC News Nigeria.” There, however, is BBC Africa, a subsidiary of British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) which has its tentacles in African continent. In Nigeria, four languages are available on the BBC platform, namely: BBC Pidgin, BBC Hausa, BBC Igbo and BBC Yoruba. There is nothing like “BBC News Nigeria.” This suggests that the page is bogus and a clickbait. A further search by Dubawa showed that the Crowd 1 investment also runs another sponsored Facebook page to promote its activities, promising “double” profit of investment in two hours. Although it uses the name “Ibitomi, the page uses the logo/favicon of Vanguard newspaper, a Nigerian news publication, for the same clickbait reason. V letter with a deep colour-touch of red is the logo of Vanguard newspaper as shown below. On the page is another video of actor, Kelvin Ikeduba, assuring prospective investors of high ROI after investment. Part of caption under the video reads:  “We are 100% money secure. It is an approved platform that gives you double of your investment within 2hours time. Invest now and thank me later.” Without any iota of doubt, this is a desperate ploy to lure people into the investment scheme using all possibly available baits. Apart from promising higher ROI, Ponzi or investment schemes are deploying different methods to convince social media users to join them. In the case of the one discussed above, there is a desperate attempt to mislead the social media audience using the name, image and reputation of notable media organisations. The “BBC New Nigeria” page is fake.

"Claim:  A viral message on social media claims that Buhari’s regime declared a foreign national from Niger wanted for defrauding Nigeria of arms funds approximately $400 million, N400 million and €10 million.","The Chief Executive Officer of Societe D`Equipment Internationaux (SEI), Aboubakar Hima, a military contractor and Niger Republic citizen, was declared wanted, in July 2020, by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, (EFCC), in a case of criminal conspiracy, contract scam, misappropriation of public funds, money laundering and fraud. The EFCC alleged that Aboubakar, received the funds for the purchase of equipment for the Nigerian military and that investigations have revealed discrepancies in the supply of the equipment. Having failed to honour invitations from the Commission. Hima is currently evading investigation, thus the need to declare him wanted. Recently, a viral message surfaced on Whatsapp claiming that Buhari’s regime declared a foreign national from Niger wanted for defrauding Nigeria of arms funds in the amounts of approximately $400 million, N400 million and €10 million. It reads: ” No one has been fired or prosecuted for this mega fraud. The service chiefs under whom this mega looting occurred have been rewarded with ambassadorial appointments. The National Security Adviser is still in office”. The link below the post directed Dubawa to a Facebook page called US Nigeria Law Group that published the story on the 3rd of July with 44 comments and 295 shares. Dubawa first checked EFCC website to confirm the authenticity of the message, and it revealed that Aboubakar Hima was actually declared wanted but it was for a case of criminal conspiracy, contract scam, misappropriation of public funds, money laundering and fraud to the tune of $394 million, €9.9 million and N369 million, not $400 million, N400 million and €10 million as claimed by the message. Dubawa went further to run a word search and  discovered that the arms procurement saga started in 2015 when president Muhammedu Buhari came into power, and ordered the investigation. Barely three months after he assumed office in 2015, Buhari inaugurated a 13-man panel to probe the procurement of arms and related military contracts between 2007 and 2015, the panel ordered the arrest of the National Security Advisor under president Goodluck Jonathan (June 2012 – July 2015) Col. (retd.) Sambo Dasuki; who was allegedly the lynchpin in the saga, on the 17th  November 2015 The panel said in a report that between 2007 and 2015, there had been ‘extra-budgetary interventions’ for arms procurement, However, very little arms was obtained. The actual saga took place under the rule of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) government of President Umaru Yar’Adua, who ruled from 2007 until his death in 2010, and Goodluck Jonathan, Yar’Adua’s vice president, took over in 2007 and subsequently won re-election in 2011. Dasuki, from March 2012 to March 2015, effectively controlled military procurement during his period in office with no supervision and virtually no input from the Ministry of Defence, so it is not during Buhari’s regime, nor the service chiefs that were rewarded with ambassadorial appointments, and not the current National Security Adviser. While it is true that the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) have declared a Nigerien wanted for defrauding Nigeria of arms funds, it is not true that the deal took place under President Buhari’s regime and the exact amount of the deal is $394million, €9.9million, and N369 Million.  So, this information is misleading. ",misleading,08/07/2021,https://dubawa.org/aboubakar-hima-defrauded-nigeria-of-arms-funds-in-past-administration-not-in-buharis-govt/
Claim: A WhatsApp poster claims the Nigerian Army School of Nursing is receiving applications for admission into its HND Nursing programme.,"Dubawa received a poster allegedly from the Nigerian Army School of Nursing, Yaba, Lagos State, Nigeria, requesting applications for admission from para-military personnel and civilians into its ND/HND Nursing Programme. What is common knowledge is for citizens to study nursing in Schools of Nursing, receive the Certificate in Basic Nursing (which qualifies them to take the Registered Nurse Professional Certification examination) and become Registered Nurses (RN) thereafter. Some universities in Nigeria have also commenced the B.Sc Degree programme in Nursing a few years back. Most Nigerians are however not familiar with ND/HND degree programmes in Nursing. This explains why some WhatsApp users expressed doubts about the authenticity of the call for applications. Nigerians are bombarded daily with fake calls for higher education and/or scholarships into higher education, and it is therefore understandable if they are worried about a programme that is not common knowledge. Dubawa searched online for the website of the Nigerian Army School of Nursing in Lagos but could not find any links. What Dubawa found were several other education websites which had shared the Nigerian Army School of Nursing’s 2021 Call for Applications. Dubawa then placed calls to the four mobile lines on the application poster and after several trials, an individual picked the call placed to 07063374043. A man answered the line and explained that the call for application is genuine. The army officer, who demanded not to be identified due to service rules explained that “the Nigerian government had reformed nursing education in Nigeria in collaboration with the Nursing and Midwifery Council of Nigeria and the National Board for Technical Education (NBTE)”. He said citizens can now earn degrees in Nursing through Universities (B.Sc Nursing) and Monotechnics (ND/HND Nursing). “Students who study nursing in Monotechnics will write two professional examinations organised by the Nursing and Midwifery Council of Nigeria to undertake their Registered Nurse Professional Certification (RN) and the Registered Midwife Professional Certification (RM)”, he explained. He stated further that the HND “is a straight four year course, the first two years is ND while the last two years is the HND, and the HND is compulsory. They can’t just walk away after the ND”. They will also do a one year attachment before proceeding for NYSC. The Army Officer who insisted on being anonymous said the Nigerian Army School of Nursing is currently working on its website and hopes to have it up for Nigerians soon. A Nigerian parent, Mr. Dahiru Garba, also confirmed to Dubawa that his daughter is undertaking her HND programme in Nursing in the College of Nursing, Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University Teaching Hospital, Bauchi State and that the HND programme in Nursing is genuine and has been approved by the government. He also told Dubawa that “the Nursing and Midwifery Council is proposing to phase out the Certificate in Basic Nursing programme in 2023 and Nigerians can only do the ND/HND degree or the B.Sc degree programmes in nursing because there are issues with placing holders of the Certificate in Basic Nursing qualification in the civil service”. Nigerian Army School of Nursing, Lagos was approved in 2018 (alongside 265 other approved institutions) for the training of nurses in Nigeria by the Nursing and Midwifery Council of Nigeria (NMCN) as well as by the National Board of Technical Education.  The Nigerian government approved the HND degree programme in Nursing, to be offered by monotechnics in the country in 2016 under a collaboration between the National Board for Technical Education (NBTE) and Nursing and Midwifery Council of Nigeria (N&MCN). The current call for applications for admission by the Nigerian Army School of Nursing is genuine.

"Claim: A viral image, making the rounds on social media, depicts Nnamdi Kanu alongside a woman in a compromised position.","Claim: A viral image, making the rounds on social media, depicts Nnamdi Kanu alongside a woman in a compromised position.    The claim The alleged  viral picture of Nnamdi alongside a certain woman was doctored. The face of the man in the picture was distorted and changed to that of Nnamdi Kanu. Hence this picture is fake.  Three days after DUBAWA debunked several claims on how the federal government arrested the IPOB leader, Nnamdi Kanu (read more here); a new, similar claim is now making the rounds.  The debunked post was the one shared by Sojworldnews where some pictures and video of Nnamdi Kanu posing affectionately with a lady was alleged to have been sent by the federal government as bait to arrest Nnamdi Kanu.  The picture attached to the former claim that was debunked by DUBAWA DUBAWA later confirmed the claim to be false and the lady in the post turned out to be Nnamdi’s wife. However, the new claim is another scandalous picture of Nnamdi Kanu. The picture depicts a shirtless man sitting on the edge of a bed, alongside a woman who was also sitting on the same bed while holding on tight to him.  The man bears the face of Nnamdi Kanu and the woman was not from an earlier debunked claim. Though the picture had no narrative attached to it, the impression it aimed to paint appears clear. A user on a WhatsApp group where the picture was shared commented that: “If  Nnamdi Kanu, a man so respected by his people can succumb to women, then all hope is lost for good men” the user agonized in total believability.   The new acclaimed photo of Nnamdi Kanu alongside an unknown woman making rounds.  When DUBAWA carried out a Google reverse image search on the acclaimed picture of Nnamdi Kanu alongside a lady, the results show that the picture was doctored from an original version. The man in question was not Nnamdi Kanu but was altered to bear Kanu’s face.  The original picture that was doctored to place Nnamdi Kanu’s face Even more revealing was the fact that the original picture was taken from a news story on Naijaloaded, where a man was caught in bed with a 4-month pregnant, married woman. The story emerged  in March 2021 and was massively reported on different news outlets, mostly with the headline “Husband catches pregnant wife having sex with another man.” Other sets of the picture show the actual face of the man and the woman, who was not Nnamdi Kanu nor the woman his wife.     Other sets of the picture showing the actual face of the man and woman in question The alleged viral picture of Nnamdi alongside a certain woman, making the rounds on social media, was doctored.

"Claim: A website, utmeoffical.net, claims it can upgrade scores  for candidates that did not score up to the cut-off mark in JAMB examination.","The Joint Admissions and Matriculations Board (JAMB) is a Nigerian entrance examination board for tertiary-level institutions. The board conducts Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) for prospective candidates into Nigerian universities, and it is also charged with the responsibility of administering similar examinations for applicants to Nigerian public and private monotechnic, polytechnics, and colleges of education. JAMB commenced the 2021 UTME across the country on the 19th of June and results were released to candidates on 25th June. Recently, a website utmeoffical.net, claimed it can upgrade scores  for candidates that did not score up to cut off mark in the examination., The website claims to be a union of staff from various tertiary institutions in Nigeria, urging candidates to either subscribe immediately or lose out. It went further to upload testimonial photos to prove that the claim is true. It also asks candidates to freely specify any score they wish, noting that 200+ will cost 27,000 naira and 37,000 Nair for 300+. In the same vein, a Facebook handle, Jamb upgrade 2021 has been publishing a series of posts recently, urging candidates to upgrade their JAMB scores, by calling or messaging (+2348067525387), noting that they do not collect money in full before upgrading the result. It reads; “I can guarantee you that no matter what you score, I will upgrade it but not above 290 but for those who are going for medical related courses, the maximum upgrade score is 320.The upgrading has begun already so hurry up and get yours done immediately. You have from now till July to upgrade your result.” In reaction to the post,  some of the users clamoured for help while others displayed their testimonies. First off, we checked the JAMB website to verify this information but JAMB’s last publication was on the 14th of June 2021 and it it was not about the result upgrade. Dubawa then contacted the number posted (+2348067525387) on WhatsApp to ask questions. The agent replied to our message immediately. Then this writer asked for the upgrade of 130 JAMB score, the agent replied, “Per scratch card is #5,000 and each scratch card carries 50 marks, if you are buying 2 cards that’s #10,000, but for an instant, you scored 150 and you buy one scratch card, that’s 50 marks will be added to ur initial score to make it 200marks!” This writer went further to ask if the process is approved by JAMB, the responder replied in the affirmative. “Yes 100% ,due to the rate of JAMB failure this year we decided to bring in an opportunity for student who wish to get more score, although you may not see this on any news feed because we are using an hacked system to generate this upgrade but we also work with JAMB administration”  Screenshot of WhatsApp message Dubawa also discovered that the JAMB upgrade Facebook page was created on the 26th June 2021, three days before JAMB released the 2021 results and it already has over 5000 followers.  Screenshot of Facebook page So Dubawa went on to  contact the JAMB Public Relations Officer, Dr Fabian Benjamin, who said that candidates should not fall for  fraudsters that parade themselves online as  JAMB agents. In his words, “JAMB does not use the internet to score candidates or to write examinations, we use Local Area Network, a collection of devices connected together in our office, we only use the internet to upload questions which takes at least three minutes. We only post the results on the internet for candidates to print out their scores but the original results that we would be sending to schools are not on the internet, so even if you decide to pay fraudsters to upgrade your score, it will be useless. “Do not let anyone deceive you that they can hack our website to upgrade scores, they can only access the score we posted on the website not the original results we would be sending to Institutions for admission, beware, JAMB upgrade doesn’t work. JAMB results upgrade is a scam and myth. You need to be very careful.” he said. Findings have shown that JAMB results upgrade advertised by utmeoffical.net is a scam. Therefore, the public should disregard information published by the websites.

Claim: A viral post on WhatsApp is asking Nigerians to apply for the Federal Civil Service Commission (FCSC) vacancies via a website.,"Claim: A viral post on WhatsApp is asking Nigerians to apply for the Federal Civil Service Commission (FCSC) vacancies via a website. The information circulating on WhatsApp that the FCSC is now recruiting, via a certain link, is false. The website is found to be fraudulent. A viral post on WhatsApp claims the Federal Civil Service Commission is currently looking for candidates to fill vacant positions in some ministries and department agencies.

Findings by Dubawa shows that the Federal Civil Service Commission of Nigeria (FCSC) is an executive body in Nigeria that has the authority to make appointments and transfers, and to exercise disciplinary control over all federal civil servants. The Federal Civil Service Commission (FCSC) is responsible for the following; representation of the civil service commissioners at senior staff committee meetings of ministries, review and approval of recommendations on disciplinary cases of senior officers, recruitment of senior officers, ratification of promotion of offices to senior positions, including conducting promotion interviews and exams, hearing appeals on matters of appointment, promotion and disciplines, providing guidelines on appointments, promotions and discipline. Checks on the message showed that it contained grammatical error and irregular capitalisation of certain letters that cast doubts on its authenticity. Vacancies was wrongfully spelt as “Vaccancies”  When Dubawa accessed the website, the logo was similar to the FCSC logo. Dubawa provided a wrong name, state, gmail, phone number inorder to access the other pages of the form.

Dubawa contacted the agency via the website but is still awaiting a response. Dubawa also conducted a search on Folasade Majebi, the acclaimed Head of Nigeria Civil Servant, who purportedly signed the message but found nothing. Further checks show that the commission debunked a similar claim in 2019 stating that it only advertises vacancies on newspapers and its website www.fedcivilservice.gov.ng.  According to an advertisement published by a news platform, Vanguard, in 2017, applicants are usually asked to submit their application via vacancy.fedcivilservice.gov.ng/ or send their application form in a sealed envelope stating the ministry, the post applied for and addressed to the Chairman, Federal Civil Service Commission, 4 Abidjan Street, Wuse Zone 3, Abuja.

Claim: A viral WhatsApp message claims taking pain relievers or anesthesia after COVID-19 vaccination is dangerous and both should be avoided for two years.,"Aches or pain are common side effects of coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine. Vaccination side effects show that the vaccine is teaching the immune system how to recognize and attack SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19). To relieve this pain, some vaccinated persons turn to pain relievers or killers. A recent viral WhatsApp message claims that pain relievers like diclofenac should be avoided for two years after taking COVID-19 vaccine. According to this message, the adverse effects of the vaccine and pain relievers have been fatal, making reference to a doctor who allegedly killed his wife by injecting her with diclofenac after COVID-19 vaccination. “PLS IF YOU HAVE BEEN VACCINATED FOR COVID 19 AVOID DICLOFENAC OR ANY ANAESTHESIA FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS. THE ADVERSE EFFECTS OF THE VACCINE WITH THESE HAVE BEEN FATAL.” Excerpt of the viral WhatsApp message. Taking a close look at this claim, Dubawa noted this claim sounded and looked like the one fact-checked earlier in April, 2021. While the April claim says taking Pain killers after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine is dangerous and can lead to death, the recent claim says to avoid diclofenac and any other anesthesia if vaccinated.  Both claims seem to be tied to the same story of a doctor who killed his wife by injecting her with a dose of Diclofenac after she had earlier received the COVID-19 vaccine. Dubawa’s earlier check however showed that the woman’s death was not vaccine related. Dubawa conducted a keyword search on Anesthesia and pain relievers. Anesthesia are medicines used during tests and surgical operations to numb sensation in certain areas of the body or induce sleep to prevent pain and discomfort. This search led to checks by Quint and India.com  discrediting the claim that getting anesthesia after vaccination is dangerous  Pain relievers are medicines that reduce or relieve headaches, sore muscles, arthritis, or other aches and pains. There are different pain medicines, with advantages and risks.  Some types of pain respond better to certain medicines than others and each person may also have a slightly different response to a pain reliever. Pain relievers go by many names; Analgesics, Narcotics, Painkillers, Pain medicine etc. There are different types of pain relievers but they can be classified into two types! Over-the-counter pain relievers and prescribed pain relievers. Over-the-counter (OTC): These are pain medications available at stores for any adult to purchase. They include; Acetaminophen, Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) ( under which Ibuprofen and Diclofenac fall under), Combination drugs (contain both acetaminophen and aspirin, an NSAID), and Topical (cream, gel, spray or patch) that can be applied directly to the skin. Prescription: These medications are only available with a prescription from a healthcare provider as they provide stronger pain relief. They treat severe or chronic pain. These include; Antidepressants, Anti-seizure medications, Muscle relaxers, Opioids, Steroids and Topical. A look at studies and reports show that the arguments around pain relievers and vaccines is on the possibility of pain relievers curbing the necessary immune system response necessary to fight the virus like this study shows not on any health danger The Centre for Disease Control (CDC) in it’s recent report in June on how to relieve COVID-19 side effects warns against pain killers before vaccination but notes it can be taken afterwards with due consultation with your doctor. Dubawa also reached out to persons who have been vaccinated in Nigeria to get their experience if any with pain relievers. Mr Richard Akinwunmi, who has gotten his complete dose (two dose) of the Astrazeneca vaccine explained he took ibuprofen after his first dose and there was no adverse effect.  “For my first dose, no pain until the night of that day. I experienced a heavy shoulder and muscle spasms so I took ibuprofen for 3 days and a lot of water. For my Second dose, I started feeling feverish (malaria kind) almost immediately and I took a lot of water and paracetamol for 3 days.” Excerpt of Mr Richard’s response. Alhassan Bala on the other hand said he only took paracetamol. “Maybe because I am the type of person that hates pills, I only took paracetamol after I started experiencing fever a few hours after the dose. The fever went away after about 24hours.” Excerpt of Alhassan’s response.  Just like Alhassan, Lateef Sanni also took paracetamol which he said was recommended by the health officials where he got his vaccine and he was fine afterwards. “I only took paracetamol if that qualifies as a pain reliever. The doctors instructed that if I feel funny that I should use paracetamol. And that was what I did. Immediately I took it, the malaria-like symptoms I had disappeared.” Excerpt of Mr Lateef’s response. Speaking to health officials, Dubawa gathered pain relievers can be taken after vaccination not before. A medical officer, Lynda Effiong-Agim said it is not advisable to take pain relievers before vaccination but they can be taken afterwards as long as the person has no previous contraindication using NSAIDS. “If the person previously had no contraindication to using NSAIDS then there is no issue because NSAIDS aren’t for everyone. However the NSAID is not to be taken in advance before vaccination, it is afterwards to help with pain, e.t.c.” Excerpt of Dr Lynda’s comment. Another health official, a gynaecologist, Dr Monday Idoko, at Garki hospital Abuja said the claim is not scientifically justifiable and if true maybe a coincidence. On paracetamol which most of the vaccinated persons we spoke to said they took, he clarified it is also part of pain relievers. “But the claims aren’t scientifically justifiable. It may be a coincidence. Diclofenac is an abused drug bought over the counter so if it were true, we would have had a lot of these cases.” Excerpt of Dr Idoko’s comment. Dubawa also reached out to the World Health Organisation (WHO) via email. The organisation responded saying there are no recommendations that diclofenac or anesthesia should be avoided for two years following vaccination. The WHO added that pain killers may be used for injection site pain following vaccination, but generally paracetamol is what is recommended. “Diclofenac is an anti-inflammatory drug, and not an anaesthetic agent. The oral preparation of diclofenac is used to reduce inflammation and pain. The injectable version of the drug is only recommended for severe pain, often post-operative pain, and given under close medical supervision. Anaphylactic reactions have been reported following diclofenac, which from the news reports is felt to be the cause of death in the doctor in India. “Pain killers may be used for injection site pain following vaccination, but generally paracetamol is what is recommended. There are no recommendations that diclofenac or anaesthesia should be avoided for 2 years following vaccination.” Excerpt of WHO’s response  The claim that diclofenac or anesthesia should be avoided after vaccination is false and misleading as our findings and WHO’s response shows this.

"Claim: A viral message making the rounds on WhatsApp and referenced to Nuhu Ribadu, Former boss of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) claims that President Muhammadu Buhari instigated banditry in Nigeria to oust  former President Goodluck Jonathan.","Claim: A viral message making the rounds on WhatsApp and referenced to Nuhu Ribadu, Former boss of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) claims that President Muhammadu Buhari instigated banditry in Nigeria to oust  former President Goodluck Jonathan. The viral WhatsApp message is misleading. There is no confirmed source to the story and the spokesperson to Ribadu has debunked the message, tagging it as ‘fake news’.  Before the 2015 general elections, insecurity was a major problem in the Nigerian society. While most of the attacks experienced were referenced to Boko Haram, banditry was not much of a topical issue then. However, fast forward to 2018, till now, Banditry has become a prominent issue in the centre of Nigeria’s security issue.  Since its emergence, security analysts have been trying to understand its nature, sponsorship and patterns of attacks. It is in the light of this reality, that a  viral WhatsApp message claims that Muhammadu Buhari, the current Nigerian president instigated banditry to oust Goodluck Jonathan, who was then president of the country until his defeat by the latter in the 2015 general elections. The acclaimed message is referenced to Nuhu Ribadu, the former Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, and has  already been shared several times on WhatsApp, and on and recently even published in a feature magazine; rendering an unverified account of the origin of banditry in the country.  The viral message also alleged that Buhari sought the services of mercenaries, who were recruited from neighbouring countries, to claim power for the Fulani group in case he loses the 2015 presidential election. To give credibility to the narrative, the message was attributed to the former EFCC boss, Nuhu Ribadu as the author.   The same viral message as featured in Savanna Express Magazine with picture of Nuhu Ribadu Nuhu Ribadu, is a former Nigerian Police Officer and Politician. He was the Chairman of the Petroleum Revenue Task force and eventually the founding chairman of Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), the Nigerian government anti corruption body. EFFC, from 2003–2007. Dubawa analysed the message and found out that it was highly disjointed with a lot of spelling errors. Typical errors that should not have been prevalent with such important acclaimed messages, and also questionable in the essay of Nuhu Ribadu,  who authored a book.  The reporter further reached out to the Publisher of the feature magazine, SAVANNA EXPRESS, where the article was published in Vol  9, No 98 ISSN 98760 -5432, Page 39 – 40 on  23rd June 2021 with the caption: ‘Nuhu Ribadu: BOMBSHELL ON BANDITRY’. In his response, as regards the source to the story, Mr Michael Eluwa, the publisher of the Savanna Magazine, who did not deny publishing the article,  admitted that he was practicing “guerilla Journalism” to fight the government as such he won’t disclose the source of the information. In a bid to uncover the actual genealogy of the story, Dubawa also reached out to Nuhu Ribadu’s former aide and journalist, AbdulAziz AbdulAziz, who said that the message has been on since June  2019 and a rebuttal regarding the acclaimed message has been sent out by Nuhu Ribadu, using his social media handles. AbdulAziz, added that the former EFCC Chairman has even  “called on security agencies to investigate the origin of the message and prosecute those behind it, but was surprised the message was still trending on social media.” AbdulAziz beckoned to the public to disregard the message, which he described as “clear insanity and a cheap blackmail.” Further scrutiny by Dubawa showed that there was no such report in any credible media organisations. Even so, Dubawa found out that the message wrongly captured Nuhu Ribadu who was Assistant Inspector General of Police (AIG) in 2014 not the Deputy Superintendent (DSP) of Police as posed by the message.   This message allegedly written by Nuhu Ribadu titled “Bandits were created by Muhammadu Buhari to oust Jonathan” is misleading.

CLAIM: Twitter suspends Kenya’s President account over Nnamdi Kanu arrest,"CLAIM: Twitter suspends Kenya’s President account over Nnamdi Kanu arrest  The claims that the account of Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta got suspended after Biafrans reported it over the arrest of Nnamdi Kanu is false.  A Twitter user CorrectBN with handle @correctbn in a tweet on July 1, 2021, claims the account of Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta got suspended after Biafrans reported it over the arrest of Nnamdi Kanu. Kanu, the self-styled leader of outlawed movement, the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), which agitates for a separate state for ethnic Igbos in southeast Nigeria, has been labelled a terrorist organization by the Nigerian government. The IPOB leader, who was facing charges bordering on treasonable felony following his campaign for the secession of Republic of Biafra, had jumped bail in 2017 after a military action, code-named “Operation Python Dance”, targeted his family house in Abia state  His arrest was announced by Nigeria’s justice minister and Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami (SAN), who said it was done in collaboration with INTERPOL.  To verify this claim Dubawa began by conducting a search on the microblogging platform Twitter to find out if the account truly existed, which returned a series of parody accounts carrying Kenya’s president name and picture. However, a Google search revealed a story published in March 23 2019 about the President temporarily deactivating his social media accounts due to what it termed infiltration by unauthorised individuals.  Screenshot of the news on news.cn  According to Twitter, when you deactivate your account, it is possible to restore your account for up to 30 days after deactivation.  A further search on the handle in question @UKenyatta reveals that it was a parody account created in March 2020 almost a year after the government announced the deactivation of the President Twitter account. This simply means that the username was available and someone took advantage by making a parody out of it.  Screenshot of news on the return of the Twitter account  Also, in November 2020 President Kenyatta while talking about deactivating his personal Twitter account which reported by Arise tv says he would rather talk to his wife and sleep, because he always gets angered by the insults on Twitter and couldn’t sleep.  Screenshot of Arise news website with the story  The Kenyan President’s personal twitter account had more than three million followers before it was deactivated and his administration now uses a verified State House account @StateHouseKenya, which has over one million followers.  Screenshot of Twitter handle of State of Kenya The claims that the account of Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta got suspended after Biafrans reported it over the arrest of Nnamdi Kanu is untrue as online resource material shows that the Kenyan President has deactivated his Twitter since 2019 and the suspended was a fake account of the President created in March 2020.

"Claim: A Facebook post, quoting a warning by President Muhammadu Buhari to all local government chairmen in Nigeria, where the President was reported to have threatened that any chairman who hands over his LG funds to his state governor will be questioned has gone viral.","On Tuesday, 22 of June 2021, a post was made on Facebook by Mr Joe Igbokwe, a member of the All Progressives Congress and Special Adviser, Office of Drainage Services to the Lagos State Governor, where the President of Nigeria, Muhammadu Buhari purportedly threatened local government chairmen in the country with EFCC and Kirikiri prison if they handed their local government funds to their governors. The post which has gone viral and shared multiple times both on Facebook and WhatsApp reads: President Buhari Warns Local Government Council Chairmen: “You people are just wasting your time, We have sent money directly to Local Government Account this week. And if you like, withdraw the money from that account and hand over to your Governor, you will give account of it properly at EFCC or Kirikiri Maximum Prison.” ~ President Buhari. As of Tuesday, 22 June 2021, when the post was sighted by our researcher, it had garnered 1,300 likes, 17 comments and 932 shares on Facebook alone. It had been shared many times on WhatsApp, and had even attracted commendation from many groups on WhatsApp. Media aide to the President, Femi Adesina, was sent a message (SMS), but he did not respond. However, a check on all platforms where the presidency announces it’s activities returned no press release or related comments. Of all the press releases from the presidency posted on his Facebook page, none of them reflected the claim. Additionally, a check on the activities on the Facebook page of Mr Garba Shehu, the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, did not return any post pointing to any such event or statement credited to the President. Although in recent times, President Muhammadu Buhari has been making moves and statements that seem to reflect this idea. He repeatedly lamented that his administration’s anti-corruption fight had been slowed down because of the comatose nature of local governments. He even hinted at his desire to have independent, financially autonomous local government administration in Nigeria, stating that this would pave the way for restructuring, which many Nigerians appear to be clamouring for. In 2019, the President made moves to grant local governments (and the judiciary at the states) financial autonomy. But he got around this with the signing of Executive Order 10 of 2020. Upon signing the EO 10, President Buhari was quoted to have said: “Based on the power vested in me under Section 5 of the 1999 Constitution (as Amended), I, today, signed into law Executive Order No. 10 of 2020 for the implementation of Financial Autonomy of State Legislature and State Judiciary. This administration will continue to do everything to strengthen the principles and practice of democracy and democratic governance in Nigeria.” Also, early in 2021, the president ordered the dissolution of Local Government caretaker committees nationwide because they were not legally recognised, and in breach of the provisions of Section 7(1) of the 1999 constitution (as amended). The President had reportedly directed the Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, to request state governors operating caretaker committees at local government level to immediately disband such committees and restore democratically elected representatives. Joe Igbokwe, the author, was reached for comments. When asked to substantiate the post, and confirm the place and time of the statement he credited to the President, he asked this writer by asking whether it was the first time he was hearing such a statement. He could neither substantiate the claim nor give any official link to validate the claim.  His reply: ‘Is it fake news? Is this the first time you are hearing it? Is this the first time you are hearing it? Is it that you don’t know that the money, the government now send (sic) money to the local government directly?’ There is no official confirmation or publication to substantiate the claim by Mr Joe Igbokwe.

Dangote is  well known for his production of  essential household commodities such as flour, sugar, salt, pasta, and condiments in addition to the large number of employees on his payroll.  There is no doubt that Africa will lose a great deal if Dangote moves its investment outside Africa. This is what sent Dubawa on a fact-checking mission on whether it is true that Dangote is investing sixty percent of his investment in the USA. Aliko Dangote, a Nigerian billionaire business magnate. He is the wealthiest man in Africa, with an estimated net worth of 11.1 billion as of May 2021. Aliko Dangote owns the largest cement plants in Sub-Saharan Africa located in Nigeria and Ghana. In the bid to fact-check this claim, Dubawa conducted a google search and found the David Rubenstein interview where Dangote established that he has an office in London and is working towards having a family office in New York, United States.  The 24 minutes long interview posted on YouTube in January 2020 captured Dangote telling David Rubenstein, the host, that he plans to expand ‘outside Africa’ but not specifically to the United States as claimed by the viral WhatsApp image. In his actual words, “We are not going to remain dominant only in Africa, we are going to invest outside Africa’’ While talking about his plans to invest outside Africa, he mentioned that his company at the time of the interview has a 4-billion-dollar revenue and plans to grow it to about 30 billion dollars in two years. It is from this money that Dangote plans to invest outside Africa. Although he mentioned that a major percentage of that money will be invested outside of Africa, he did not state where exactly and he wasn’t specific about the percentage he will invest outside Africa. However, he said that 40 percent of the money will be used to continue investment in Africa. As quoted from the interview, Dangote said, “We have a company that has revenue of four billion dollars. In the next two years we will have a company that has revenue of about 30 billion dollars, so with that we will have quite a lot of money. What we are trying to do is to use a major percentage of the money to invest outside Africa and use about 40 percent of it to continue to invest in Africa because we have invested very heavily in Africa.” Contrary to the claim that Dangote wants to invest 60% of his assets in the United States, Dubawa’s findings show that Dangote has a plan to invest a major percentage of his company’s revenue outside Africa. The business magnate did not state where exactly he wants to invest in and the precise percentage he wants to invest. However, he made known that ‘a major percentage of his revenue will be used.’ ",USA,03/07/2021,https://dubawa.org/africas-billionaire-aliko-dangote-is-not-investing-60-of-his-asset-in-the-usa/
"Claim: The Oyo State Governor, Engineer Seyi Makinde recently claimed that the fees charged by Oyo State owned Ladoke Akintola University of Technology (LAUTECH) is the lowest in the entire South-West of Nigeria.","Claim: The Oyo State Governor, Engineer Seyi Makinde recently claimed that the fees charged by Oyo State owned Ladoke Akintola University of Technology (LAUTECH) is the lowest in the entire South-West of Nigeria. Governor Makinde’s claim that LAUTECH tuition fees is the lowest among state-owned universities in the South West of Nigeria is incorrect. The Governor of Oyo State, Engineer Seyi Mainde, claimed recently that the fee charged by the Oyo State owned Ladoke Akintola University of Technology (LAUTECH) was the lowest in the South-West of Nigeria. He said this on Tuesday, 1st of June 2021, while announcing a 25 per cent reduction in school fees for students of LAUTECH, Ogbomosho, during a brief interaction with the students at the school auditorium in Ogbomosho. According to a statement by the Chief Press Secretary to the governor, Mr. Taiwo Adisa, Makinde said he was thankful to the students for according him warm reception despite the impromptu nature of his visit. He also stated that he was happy to fulfill the promise of securing the sole ownership of LAUTECH for Oyo State. Makinde said: “I am glad to be back among you. After the 2019 election, I should have returned to say thank you to you but I didn’t want to come until I fulfill what I promised you, which is the sole ownership of LAUTECH by Oyo State. “I am still coming back to spend the night here and we will really celebrate then but I can leave you with a parting gift for today. Let me tell you, the LAUTECH fee is still the lowest in the entire South-West. Having said that, I will reduce your fee across board; whether indigenes or non-indigenes, even new students. There will be a reduction of 25 per cent across board.” The Guardian newspaper of the 1st of June 2021, quoting the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), recalled that ‘hitherto, students of Oyo state origin paid =N= 140,000 while non indigenes paid =N= 170, 000.’ A check on the fees portal of the website of Ladoke Akintola University of Technology shows the following fees paid by both indigenes of Oyo State and non-indigenes for 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 sessions: This indicates that the fees for both indigenes and non-indigenes had been increased in the last three years, and these fee regimes obtained up to the June 1st 25 percent reduction by the Governor, and his claim that LAUTECH fees were the cheapest in South West Nigeria. With a 25 percent slash in the fees, and when implemented by the Institution, Oyo State Indigenes will pay =N= 105,000 (with =N= 35,000 shaved off their fees) while non-indigenes will pay =N= 127,500 (with =N= 42,500 off the fees regime obtainable before the Governor’s proclamation).  The Governor’s claim has prompted a survey of fees payable by fellow state owned Universities in the South West. The Olabisi Onabanjo University (OOU), Ago-Iwoye is owned by the Ogun State government. Although OOU fees are not readily available on the website of the Institution, but a check on a website that focuses on tertiary institutions students needs and aggregates the fees charged by Nigerian universities, recruitmentbeam.com.ng gives the 2021 fees on the bases of faculties as follows: Faculty of Agriculture (77,870.00), Education: Arts and Social Sciences (82,372.00), Engineering (116,296.00), Law (132,996.00) and Medicine (176,396.00) For the Osun State University, basic tuition fee for non-science courses includes 130,000 (190,000 with other charges), Nursing/Law 195,000 (265,000), and Medicine 550,000 (630,000). Ondo State University of Science and Technology (OSUSTECH) charges 30,000 for state indigenes (making 100,000 when other charges are added) and 60,000 for non-indigenes (150,000) for sciences/agriculture, Engineering 70,000 (150,000), 100,000 (200,000 for non-indigenes) for the 2021/2022 Academic session. Similarly, a check on the other Ondo State owned institution, Adekunle Ajasin University (AAUA) Akoko-Akungba indicates that the institution charges 120,000 (Science and Management Sciences), 100,000 (Agriculture), 80,000 (Arts and Education), and 150,000 (Law) as fees payable by all returning students for the 2021/2022 session. As of March 2021, the Ekiti State University (EKSU), also in the South west of Nigeria, charges 140,600 fees for the 2020/2021 session. This amount includes tuition and other charges. For the Lagos State University (LASU) students in the Arts and Social Science pay 113,250 for fresh students (86,750 for returning students), Law and Sciences 115,750 (88,250), Engineering 115,750 (143,250 for returning students). A comparative examination of the fees charged by all universities in the Southwest of Nigeria shows that Olabisi Onabanjo University Ago Iwoye charges between 77,870 and 176,396 (about the same with LAUTECH), Osun State University 130,000 to 550,000 (higher than LAUTECH, Ondo State University of Science and Technology (OSUSTECH) 30,000 to 60,000 (lower than LAUTECH), Ekiti State University (EKSU), 140,600 (at par with amount paid by indigenes at LAUTECH), Adekunle Ajasin University (AAUA), 80,000 to 150,000 (the maximum fee is somewhere between what indigenes and non-indiges pay at LAUTECH),  and Lagos State University (LASU) 113,250 to 143,250 (far lower than LAUTECH). Governor Makinde’s claim that LAUTECH tuition fees was the lowest among state-owned universities in the country, especially in the South West is incorrect, as there are state owned universities in the South west like EKSU and LASU which charge fees lower than, or in the region of fees obtainable in the Ladoke Akintola University of Technology, LAUTECH.

"Claim: A news website Sojworldnews posted pictures and video of a lady, claiming she was used as bait by the federal government to lure and arrest IPOB leader Nnamdi Kanu.","On the 29th of June, the Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, during a press conference revealed that the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has been located and brought back to Nigeria to face trial for terrorism. The Justice Minister said Kanu went missing when he jumped bail granted to him by Justice Nyako in late 2017 on an 11 count charge bordering on terrorism, treasonable felony, managing an unlawful society, publication of defamatory matter, illegal possession of firearms and improper importation of goods among others. Malami, who added that Kanu was apprehended on Sunday June 27th 2021, did not say where Kanu was extradited from. Although, officials of the British government have said he was not arrested in the UK. Meanwhile, several versions have emerged on how the federal government was able to arrest the IPOB leader. One of such is a post by Sojworldnews where some pictures and video were posted and claimed as that of a lady used by the federal government as bait to arrest Nnamdi Kanu. In the three minutes video, the half cald lady was seen on a bed with a man deemed to be Nnamdi Kanu getting intimate. A Yandex reverse image search of the pictures and video and the search led to various links. One of such is a post by Lindaikejiblog on the  April 11 2019 tagged “Half naked video of Biafran leader Nnamdi Kanu in bed with a woman believed to be his wife surfaces online” Another post discovered was that of naijalivetv on April 12, 2019 tagged ‘Just imagine….

Nnamdi Kanu had in a Twitter post reacted saying the lady in the video and pictures with him is that of his wife, Uchechi. Though the Federal Government is yet to reveal how and where the IPOB leader, Nnamdi Kanu was extradited from, the video and pictures allegedly of a lady used by the federal government to lure Nnamdi Kanu is false.

"Claim: The CEO of Crowwe application and one-time presidential aspirant, Adamu Garba, has claimed that he asked Google to take down his social media platform from Google Playstore because he needed to update the App.","Claim: The CEO of Crowwe application and one-time presidential aspirant, Adamu Garba, has claimed that he asked Google to take down his social media platform from Google Playstore because he needed to update the App. Verification has shown that an Application must not necessarily be removed for Updates and Google is not in the best position to remove apps for updates. Google only removes applications that are perceived to have violated its policy. Following the announcement of a ban on Twitter by the Nigerian Government, the Chief Executive Officer, IPI Group, Adamu Garba, recently presented the Crowwe app as an alternative to the microblogging website. Meanwhile a publication by Peoples Gazette on Monday, June 14, 2021, stated that Google had deleted Crowwe App days after the federal government suspended Twitter. The publication noted that the app has since received terrible reviews which could be responsible for its disappearance on the play store app. In reaction to the publication, Garba made a statement on Tuesday the 15th of June 2021, that he asked Google to take Crowwe down because he needed to update the App. Garba in an interview with The PUNCH, on Monday, said there was a bug affecting the contact list information, so he had to submit a support report to take it down which was done, and the app would be back latest by Tuesday Morning. To verify this claim, Dubawa visited Google play store on Tuesday to check if the app has been uploaded but it appears the App is still missing. This prompted Dubawa to verify if the App needs to be taken down to fix technical issues. An App Developer, the co-founder/CEO of Elesaro, Johnpaul Nwobodo, said an application must not be removed before any update, as users can download the update on Play store. Adding that, even if the App must be removed for any technical update, it is the developer or the company that is meant to remove the app not the host, in other words “not Google”. Dubawa checked on Google Play Console help, and it revealed that the Developer just needs to submit the  app bundle or APK  and Once the update is published, it will be distributed to existing users. Another look at a programming site, Venkatramanan Ramasubramanian, a mobile application developer said that a company does not necessarily have to remove an application before updating it. Google removes applications that are perceived to have violated its policy. Recall that Dubawa verified a claim by critics, that Crowwe’s Terms and Conditions were copied from another app, Spotify and it turned out to be true. Dubawa checked some of the reviews from the app users and found one threatening complain by Hollarisky, on the 06/14/2021, to sue play Store    Screenshot of Hollarisky’s complain Dubawa went on to study the Google Play store terms and policies and it states that Google can take down apps that  causes harm or liability to a user, third party, or Google — for example, by hacking, phishing, harassing, spamming, misleading others, or scraping content that doesn’t belong to you. Google Play store Policy reads “Once your app is removed, the published version of your app won’t be available on Google Play until a compliant update is submitted,”  “Until a policy violation has been fixed, don’t republish a removed app,” Crowwe is a Nigerian multi-purpose app built to ensure privacy in instant messaging and financial transaction app that comes with a digital wallet that helps to transfer and receive money while chatting. The Crowwe app, which has been described as the Nigerian multi-purpose app, built to ensure privacy in instant messaging, ease mobile payment,  connect with friends and family while building business and life, has received the worst reviews, with a 1.1 Rating from the App store. Dubawa’s Verification has shown that an Application must not necessarily be removed for Updates and Google is not in the best position to remove apps for updates. Google removes applications that are perceived to have violated its policy. As of the time of filing this report, the Crowwe App is still missing on play store. So this is to say that Adamu Garba’s claim that he asked Google to take down his social media platform from Google Playstore because he needed to update the code, is False The researcher produced this fact-check per the 2021 Kwame Karikari Fact-checking Fellowship partnership with JAY 101.9 FM Jos to facilitate the ethos of truth in journalism and enhance media literacy in the country ",policy,01/07/2021,https://dubawa.org/adamu-garba-claimed-crowwe-app-was-removed-for-an-update-but-this-is-false/
Claim: A Twitter user claims that the Arab League of Nations sent a warning message to Nigerian government on the Biafra movement.,"Claim: A Twitter user claims that the Arab League of Nations sent a warning message to Nigerian government on the Biafra movement. No evidence to ascertain the origin of the statement. The statement is not new as it has been in circulation since 2017.  Also, Nigeria is not part of the Arab League and there is no evidence that that league will make a statement about a non-member. A Twitter user, Amah Johnbosco(@johnbosco_amah), on Monday, June 28, 2021 claimed that the Arab League of Nations said the Nigerian government is on its own if it provokes war while warning the government to let Biafra go. His tweet was accompanied by a photograph and a caption saying, “BREAKING NEWS: YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN IF YOU PROVOKE WAR IN NIGERIA, LET BIAFRA GO: ARAB LEAGUE OF NATIONS WARNS NIGERIA GOVT ON BIAFRA AGITAION.” Within a few hours, this tweet has attracted over 142 retweets, more than 120 likes and over 30 comments. Dubawa conducted multiple searches that show that this claim has been posted by multiple Facebook and Twitter users. The search led to a Facebook post by Biafra TV, the same claim with more details attached to it. The post had 149 reactions, 42 comments and 242 shares as at Monday evening. According to this post, the claim was made by a senior civil servant in the presidency who granted an interview to Family Writers Chief Media Analyst, Mazi Onyebuchi Eze, but pleaded anonymity. “According to a senior civil servant in the presidency who granted interview to Family Writers Chief Media Analyst, Mazi Onyebuchi Eze, but pleaded anonymity made it clear during the interview that the Arab countries have warned Nigeria government to allow Biafra to secede from Nigeria in peace through the instrumentality of referendum as currently demanded by Biafrans.” A keyword search showed that the claim with the detailed statement was first circulated in 2017 by several Twitter and Facebook users. Further checks by Dubawa revealed that the claim was published on some blogs. A news platform, 9 News Nigeria, on June 27, 2020, published the claim and details shared by Biafra TV.  The post was tagged with the headline: “Biafra: Heavy Tension As Arab League writes Buhari Over Rising Tension in Nigeria.” Another platform, IgbereTVnews, published the same narrative as the one on 9 News Nigeria, with the headline: “Biafrexit: Arab League writes Buhari Over Rising Tension in Nigeria.” The post also appeared on Nairaland with the same narrative and a different headline: “Arab League Sternly Warns Nigeria To Give Referendum To Biafra.”  Dubawa conducted a search on the Family Writers Chief Media Analyst, Mazi Onyebuchi Eze,who conducted the interview where the claim was made and nothing was found about him except press statements purportedly signed by him.  A screenshot showing claim was published by some blogs  ARAB LEAGUE OF NATIONS Dubawa went ahead to research the Arab League of Nations and its goal. The league is a regional organisation in the Arab world, which is located in Northern Africa, Western Africa, Eastern Africa, and Western Asia. The Arab League was formed in Cairo on March 22, 1945 initially with six members: Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and Syria. The league currently has 22 members but Syria’s participation has been suspended since November 2011. The League’s main goal is to “draw closer the relations between member states and co-ordinate collaboration between them, to safeguard their independence and sovereignty, and to consider in a general way the affairs and interests of the Arab countries.” Dubawa’s findings show that there is not enough evidence to ascertain the origin of the statement. The statement is not new as it has been in circulation since 2017. One of the objectives of the Arab league is to see to the affairs and interest of the Arab countries who are part of the league. Nigeria is not a part of the Arab league and there is no evidence that the league will make a statement about a non-member.

Claim: Viral Whatsapp messages claim thousands of mosquitoes inoculated with Viagra have escaped from a high security laboratory in China,"Claim: Viral Whatsapp messages claim thousands of mosquitoes inoculated with Viagra have escaped from a high security laboratory in China The report is a satire and should not be taken seriously. A viral message relating to the COVID-19 infodemic circulating on Whatsapp in Sierra Leone purports that thousands of genetically modified mosquitoes inoculated with Viagra have escaped from a high security laboratory in China and that their bite can lead to continuous erection and increase libido in men.  The introductory message accompanying the link reads:  “the effect of one mosquitos bite can last up to 40 hours and symptoms include an increase in libido, sexual arousal and possibly a very large erection”-Dr. Wengi Ying Yin Jing”.  The viral claim of inoculated mosquitoes with Viagra escaping from a security laboratory in Wuhan Institute of Virology was published by the World Daily Report website.  We found it to be a satirical website. The site has under its logo the disclaimer “Where facts don’t matter”. The “ABOUT US” section on the website also states the following: “WNDR assumes however all responsibility for the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content. All characters appearing in the articles in this website – even those based on real people –  are entirely fictional and any resemblance between them and any persons, living, dead, or undead is purely a miracle.” However, the introductory paragraph before the viral link that has gone viral on social media does not indicate that the content is satirical, thereby unintentionally misleading readers.  Moreover, the image of a purported 87 years old Wuhan resident attached to the article who is purported to have been hospitalized because he was bitten by one of the genetically modified mosquitoes has been wrongly used. The image is originally a Japanese super century who was aged 114 years before he died on September 28, 2003. Yukichi Chuganji was long dead before this claim appeared on their website as a victim of the genetically modified mosquito bite.

Claim: A devious website claims Nigerian scientists will land on planet Mars by December 2021 among other claims.,"A devious website, ejiblinks.xyz, has been using outrageous headlines to mislead Nigerians on social media. In recent times, the website has made various claims credited to very important personalities in Nigeria. For example, the website on 20th June published a story with this headline, “Nigerian Scientists will land on Mars planet by December 2021” and the statement was credited to the Minister of Information, Lai Mohammed. Screenshot of Publication And another story on the same day has this headline, “Northern youth rejects buying our house for the fear we are trying to run away – Igbos cries out” with an image of armed men and burning tires on a street. This story generated 1,100 reactions and 416 shares on Facebook. Dubawa first verified the credibility of the website (ejiblinks.xyz). It was observed that the reports have no by-lines and some of the headlines have no details. We also observed that the website does not have other social media platforms, except for the Aso Villa News on Facebook, where headlines are posted every hour. We started by clicking on the link only to realise that the headline has no other details. Apart from the headline and a picture of the minister, the page is blank of relevant information. We then checked the Government website, and other reliable sources to verify the claim but we couldn’t find any information regarding the claim, except for the fact that  In 2005, National Space Research and Development Agency (NASRDA) unveiled a radical plan for its future. Further, to verify the claim, Dubawa reached out to the Minister of Information via calls and messages. None was answered nor replied. Then, we ran a word search on credible news platforms, none had anything on the comment. From all indications, the headline was crafted only for click baits. Dubawa conducted a word search on the alleged arrest of Senator Aberibe and the result revealed that the website copied a story that was published by the Guardian Newspaper in 2018, word for word. In the 2018 report the senator was arrested at an Abuja Hotel. Reasons for his arrest were unknown to the Guardian as declared in the report. Recently, Abaribe was  spotted wearing ‘The Dot Nation’ T-shirt days after President Muhammadu Buhari referred to the Igbos as “a dot in a circle”, during an interview. Ejiblinks.xyz copied texts in the 2018 story to paint a picture he was recently arrested. However, Abaribe  debunked reports of his arrest by the Department of State Services, DSS, on the 24th June, noting that the reports on social media are false and should be disregarded. So, Senator Abaribe was not arrested as claimed by ejiblinks.xyz. We didn’t find any information as regards to the  claim that Northern youths are refusing to buy  houses from Igbos for the fear that they are trying to run away, when we  ran a word search.  Before this check, a click on the link also reveals a blank page save for the headline and a picture. We conducted a Google Reverse image search on the image attached to the headline and the result showed  that the image was taken on the 21st October 2020, during the #Endsars Protest In Lagos with the inscription on Voice Of America publication, ” Armed men are seen near burning tires on the street, in Lagos, Nigeria” and our word search revealed that there was no story as claimed by the report. Google Reverse Image Search results Given these misleadings, Dubawa decided to run the website through a website checker, and it revealed that the website is registered. Further, we consulted a website Developer, the CEO and co-founder of Elesaro, Johnpaul Nwobodo, who said the website is a click bait site for revenue generation. He noted that it has no proper terms and conditions (Ts and Cs). Nwobodo said “the proper Ts and Cs include details of the website owner/company and contact options”. “Ts &andCs Talks about reference to any privacy or cookies policies, and how it handles your data, talks about the protection and usage of data posted on the site. But when you see  Irregular pop ups, and excessive ads on a website, it is inappropriate,” he said. Findings have revealed that ejiblinks.xyz is a click bait website, and it only displays outrageous headlines on social media, to generate revenue, so it is misleading.

"Claim: A viral WhatsApp message claims Abu Dhabi University, Dubai, is offering fully funded scholarships in 2021.","Foreign education is highly valued in Nigeria, with the country topping the list of nations with the highest number of students in higher institutions in developed economies. Unfortunately, most Nigerian families cannot afford to pay huge tuition and living expenses for their children to study abroad. Thus, a good number of Nigerian students interested in studying abroad seek scholarships.  Dubawa received a viral text message (from different groups) claiming that Abu Dhabi University, Dubai, United Arab Emirates, is offering fully funded scholarships that “will cover full tuition, living expenses, accommodation, medical facilities, travelling allowance and stationery allowance”. The message ended with the provision of a bit.ly link for applicants to apply for the scholarship. A first level assessment of the message showed it contained several grammatical and spelling errors. The word ‘free’ was included in the title after noting that it was fully funded. ‘Benefit’ was spelt as ‘Benfit’ and ‘accommodation’ was spelt as ‘acoommodation’.            Dubawa clicked on the bit.ly link and the website changed to a new site . The new website has a welcome message which says “Study in Abu Dhabi with course of your choice for free through-out the years program”. Applicants are then asked to “fill the form bellow and click on Apply” (emphasis ours).  The form requested applicants to fill in their Full Names, Course, Phone Number, Email Address, Password, Confirm Password and also state whether this was their first application. It is important to note that there is no opportunity to create an account on the website, so some individuals may mistakenly input the passwords of their email addresses. That is why some websites usually put the disclaimer that form recipients should not input their email address passwords.      Dubawa filled in fake information to be able to proceed, this writer was led to another website. The new website congratulates the applicant, noting their application has been received and requesting them to answer some three questions quickly; their employment status, marital status and age range.  Applicants receive a pop up message immediately which says that they “have been approved to study in ABU DHABI UNIVERSITY” for free and they should fill their visa application form below. Applicants are then requested to share the link with their friends and groups. When Dubawa tried to proceed without doing so, a pop-up message insisted applicants will not be able to proceed without sharing the message. Below the message are the details of ‘fake followers’ confirming that they got the scholarship and that the process was real. Dubawa further investigated the two websites, starting with Sholarship.xyz and discovered that the website was just days old (created on June 20, 2021) by an organisation which withheld its name. It’s IP address is located in the United States, California, while country of origin is Iceland. An IP search for scholarship.xyz also shows that it is an open proxy website used by hackers and it has been reported for abuse, website attacks, hacking and fraud. Dubawa’s search for inksnation.xyz showed it is much older (5 months) as it was created on January 8, 2021. It was registered by an organisation that withheld its information. Country of Origin is Iceland but IP address is linked to California, United States, just like scholarship.xyz An IP address search for inksnation.xyz also shows it has been reported for abuses, fraud, attacks and malware use. The claim that Abu Dhabi University is giving out free scholarships in 2021 is false, misleading and mischievous. There is no legitimacy in the manner in which these websites seek to assess applicants for the purported scholarship, they are not linked to Abu Dhabi University, United Emirates, in any way and they have been reported for hacking, spams, malware and fraud.

Claim: A viral WhatsApp image has a claim that JAMB has announced a re-sit examination for July 3 for candidates with scores below 170.,"Claim: A viral WhatsApp image has a claim that JAMB has announced a re-sit examination for July 3 for candidates with scores below 170. Dubawa’s findings show this to is false as JAMB’s spokesperson also debunked the falsity. The 2021 Joint Admission and Matriculation Board (JAMB) examination which began on June 19, 2021 to end on July 3, 2021, has over 1.3 million candidates registered  in over 700 accredited Computer Based Test (CBT) centres nationwide. Following the release of JAMB result and the outcry of low scores, which characterised this year’s examination, a viral WhatsApp image has a claim that the board has decided to hold a re-sit for candidates who scored less than 170 on July 3, due to the massive failure. Message in the image urges those who fall into this category should visit https://portal.jamb.gov.ng/i-failed to get information on their centres noting there are limited slots. “Due to the mass failure being recorded in the 2021 JAnb UTME CBTs, the Joint Admission and Mateiculation Board hereby announces that there shall be a re-sit for students who scored lower than 170 in the examination.  These re-sits will hold on Saturday the 3rd of July, visit https://portal.jamb.gov.ng/i-failed to get information on your centers.” Excerpt of the message contained in the viral WhatsApp image. Looking at the image, the message seemed to be credited to JAMB’s Twitter page so Dubawa traced this page  @JAMBHQ and noticed that the last post was on May 31, 2021. Dubawa also followed the website address provided in the image which led to an error message discrediting the site. Dubawa also visited JAMB’s website and took a look at its news segment for the latest information and found the latest news on the website was on June 14 on the issues of late registration. We also tried to reach both contacts available under the “contact us” section of JAMB’s website but they were both unreachable. Dubawa went further to obtain the contact of the board’s spokesperson, Fabian Benjamin, who said JAMB’s disclaimer of this claim is everywhere referring us to online resources. “Our disclaimer is everywhere. Just check online.” Excerpt of Mr Benjamin’s response. A keyword search was therefore done in light of this to find any statement or news report where the board reacted to this claim. Dubawa found a report by the Nigerian Tribune which was published on Tuesday June 29, 2021 on the board through it’s spokesperson reacting to the claim of mass failure.  The board believes there was no mass failure as it notes low scores do not translate to mass failure. This claim is False and misleading as the Dubawa’s findings show it to be untrue. Also, board’s spokesperson confirmed this is untrue. So does it mean dat people dat got low scores won’t be able to retry this month or when cause i was really hoping to retry What Of we that missing jamb examination More details please ",falsity,01/07/2021,https://dubawa.org/no-jamb-has-not-fixed-a-re-sit-examination-for-july-3-as-claimed-in-viral-whatsapp-message/
"Claim: A viral WhatsApp message titled, ‘Fulanis In Nigeria Are Repeating What They Did In the Central African Republic And How They Were Tackled’ was purported to have been written by former Nigeria President, Olusegun Obasanjo.","The Nigerian social media space has been used several times to share fake news, incite violence and create fear in the minds of people. This is despite the limitless good opportunities it offers the teeming population. Recently, stories regarding herders-farmers clash in southern Nigerian communities have become commonplace in the news media and on social media platforms.  In view of this and other security threats, some Nigerians have called on the government to allow citizens to carry AK-47 rifles due to the security challenges faced in most parts of the country. Narratives regarding the Islamisation and ‘Fulanization’ of Nigeria by the Buhari administration have also gained prominence in social debates and discussions.  Also, multimedia files projecting these fears are being shared regularly.  However, in a bid to further push this kind of narrative, a message was put together and attributed to former President of Nigeria, Olusegun Obasanjo. The message has been shared several times on WhatsApp.  Obasanjo, who ruled as both military Head of State and civilian president, is one who had taken his time to write letters to past and current presidents of the country showing concerns over the state of the nation while proffering possible solutions to the problems. An example is one written to ex-president Goodluck Jonathan in December 2013 titled ‘Before it is too late’.  He also wrote another to Buhari in 2018 advising him to take a rest from politics. It was titled, ‘The Way Out: A Clarion Call For Coalition For Nigeria Movement’. Obasanjo has also presented himself as a strong advocate for a better Nigeria through constant interviews in the media expressing his opinion on the state of the nation.  Beyond WhatsApp groups, the message has also been shared to other social media platforms such as Facebook and some other popular websites. Part of the message reads, “Fulanis In Nigeria Are Repeating What They Did In Central African Republic And How They Were Tackled –Olusegun Obasanjo “Another civil war in Nigeria has become imminent and inevitable. The reason for its inevitability is simply because Muhammadu Buhari, the Northern Nigeria Fulani oligarchs and the wider network of Fulani in Sub-Saharan Africa have concluded plans to adopt Nigeria as the homeland for all Fulani in Africa. “Fulani have realised that the wandering and rootless lifestyle of cattle herding is no longer tenable in the twenty-first century. Fulani need to have land to call home and rear cattle and that land should be Nigeria. The indigenous peoples of Nigeria have clearly, vehemently and stridently opposed this diabolic plan and both sides are mobilising for war.  “The Fulani won’t relent and the indigenous people will not give up their land. The same Fulani Project, having failed so shamelessly and woefully in the Central African Republic, will not be allowed to fail this time as the Nigerian Fulani project is better funded with the massive [stealing] of the sovereign wealth of Nigeria through nationwide kidnapping for ransom by lower class Fulani and the seizure of the reigns of Government and wealth by the elite Fulani.  “Kidnapping and the seizure of the institutions of Government are all for the purpose of implanting Fulani into the mainstream and control of politics and the economy of Nigeria for the objective of funding the Fulani Project in Nigeria.” The message also quoted Obasanjo as saying that Central African Republic had gone through the same Fulani invasion of farmlands and communities currently being experienced in Nigeria, urging Nigerians to rise up and defend their lands.  Dubawa read the 20 paragraph-long message which sought to ‘inform’ Nigerians on plans by Buhari to take their lands for Fulanis, how the herdsmen invasion was tackled in the CAR and what Nigerians can possibly do to curtail herdsmen invasion.  The message also cited the alleged instances wherein Buhari showed a favourable disposition towards the Fulanis.  Dubawa reached out to Obasanjo’s Special Assistant on Media, Kehinde Akinyemi, who dismissed the viral message, noting that there is no basis to believe.  Akinyemi noted that Obasanjo’s standard mode of communication have been made public over time, urging readers to look out for the date of the message, and if it had been duly acknowledged by him. He said, ”In the last four, five years, we have been saying how this man sends out communication. Before anyone will believe this, it is either coming from his office dated and duly acknowledged by him, not just Olusegun Obasanjo as his name appears in the message.” Further checks by Dubawa showed that there was no such report in credible news outlets.  This message is misleading and false. Obasanjo  did not author the viral WhatsApp message titled,  ‘Fulanis In Nigeria Are Repeating What They Did In Central African Republic And How They Were Tackled’.

"Claim: A news report by People’s Daily claims the Federal Government of Nigeria is set to train 37,000 fact-checkers.","The screenshot Peoples Daily Newspaper making the rounds on WhatsApp claims the Federal Government(FG) is set to train 37,000 fact-checkers to address the issue of Fake news. Dubawa traced the original report online and found it.  According to the report, the Director General of the National Orientation Agency (NOA), Garba Abari, made the disclosure at a three day workshop held at One man village, Nasarawa state, in collaboration with Avant-Garde InterBiz limited. This workshop was themed; “Misinformation, fake news and Hate Speech Implication for National Security”. A keyword search also led to a similar report by Daily Trust. To further verify the claim, Dubawa also reached out to the spokesperson of NOA’s DG, David Akoji, who confirmed this is true and a part of it’s 5year plan. “Yes,  this is a very important component of our 5-year Strategic Work plan beginning from 2021. We plan to do this over the 5 year period working with key partners Dubawa and CDD inclusive.” Except of Mr Akoji’s response.

Claim: A Public Notice in circulation claims that fuel pump prices have been increased with immediate effect by the government.,"A Public Notice has been circulating on social media platforms, especially WhatsApp and Facebook that the Petroleum Regulatory Agency, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Trade and Industry and the Oil Marketing Companies have increased fuel pump prices with immediate effect. ‘‘With immediate effect Petrol, Diesel, Kerosene and Fuel Oil move from Le 8,500 to Le10,000 per litre.’’ It also furthered that,  ‘‘ all Oil Marketing Companies (OMC) and fuel dealers nationwide are urged to adhere to the above pump price adjustments. It continued that the government and OMC’s have agreed to reform the downstream petroleum sector in a transparent way of adjusting fuel pump prices that seek the interest of the general public,’’ the notice stated. Dubawa monitored and did several checks on the various government’s websites and social media platforms including the Petroleum Regulatory Agency, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Trade and Industry Facebook pages, but all debunked the claim.  Also the Executive Chairman of the Petroleum Regulatory, Agency Brima M Baluwa Koroma, was on one Radio Democracy on the 22nd of June to debunk the notice saying, ‘‘prices have not been increased even though it is imminent.’’  “Sierra Leone does not determine its oil or pump prices as the prices of petroleum products are determined by a combination of the international Oil reference price (PLATTS) and the foreign exchange rate,” Mr Koroma added’ From the analysis and investigations relating to the claim in the public notice, it is clear that the notice is false. Even if there might be an increase in the prices of fuel, it is yet to be effected.

"Claim: On the 17th of June 2021, during one of his live media chats, Governor of Kaduna State, Malam Nasir El-Rufai claimed that there was nowhere in the world where university or polytechnic education is free.","Kaduna State Government has been in an on- again, off- again battle with students of the state owned Kaduna State University (KASU) following an unprecedented increment in tuition fees. In April, news leaked that the university’s school fees had been increased by about 500 percent. Resident and non-resident students who paid between N23,000 and N38,000 depending on the faculty would now pay between N150,000 and N500,000, depending on the course of study.  The school management had later denied the alleged figure circulating online and in a statement stressed that: “though tuition fee would be reviewed upwards with specific fees on each course, it is yet to be announced. The figures being spread on social media are false.” Few weeks later, students of the institution took to the streets to protest the increment and called for a total reversal of the policy but the state government insisted there was no going back on the increment. The Deputy Governor of the state, Dr. Hadiza Balarabe had in a meeting with representatives of the students at the Sir Kashim Ibrahim Government House stated that the increase, though painful, was necessary. A statement later issued stressed that: “It is the only way that the institution can stay afloat. We understand the pain; we are also pained but sometimes, some decisions are taken for the betterment of the generality of the people.” As the students’ protests persisted, the school management suspended academic activities for undergraduate studies and shut down the school indefinitely. However, to make his government’s position clear, on the 17th of June 2020, during a live media chat in Hausa, Governor Nasir El-Rufai claimed there was nowhere in the world where university or polytechnic education is free. While discussing the impasse with the students of KASU and explaining that his administration offers free education from primary to secondary school, El-Rufai in the 1hrs 58 minutes chat with selected radio stations which was streamed live on Facebook said: “Education in the university or polytechnic, all around the world, there is no where you can get it for free.” This reporter conducted a keyword search using the Google search engine to research countries that offer free tertiary education for their citizens. Some of the common countries that consistently popped up as offering free tertiary education for their citizens include; Germany, Brazil, Greece Austria, Czech Republic, Norway and France. However, it is not clear how free these countries make tertiary education for their citizens as some of the countries still demand very low tuition fees while others demand semester and registration fees.   The reporter also sampled some rich countries around the world and found that countries like Brunei Darrusalam and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) offer free education up to tertiary level for their citizens. Brunei is a small country on the South China sea that borders Malaysia on the same island as Borneo and part of Indonesia. The country has enjoyed a tax-free policy since it gained independence from British rule in 1984 and financially supports a free education system for citizens throughout all levels of education. It is said that because of the country’s small population of 441, 660, most of its teachers are emigrants from Britain, Australia, or neighboring countries in Asia. Based on the country’s Ministry of Education website there are only four universities in the country. They  include; Universiti Brunei Darussalam (UBD), UniversitiTeknologi Brunei (ITB), Universiti Islam Sultan Sharif Ali (UNISSA) and Politeknik Brunei.  On the embassy website of the  United Arab Emirates  for Washington DC, the UAE clearly states that it is a country that places high priority on education which is why the literacy rate for both genders stands at 95 percent in the country. The UAE prides itself as home to a wide range of public and private universities and offers UAE citizens free education at government institutions. The website states that: “UAE citizens can attend government institutions free of charge, and the UAE has one of the highest application participation rates in the world. Ninety-five percent of all girls and 80 percent of boys enrolled in the final year of secondary school apply for admission to a higher education institution.” Governor Nasir El-Rufai’s claim that no country in the world offers free university or polytechnic education is untrue as online resource materials contradict the governor’s claim.

Claim: A viral WhatsApp video claims doing a few minutes heart massage and breathing exercises would increase blood circulation in two weeks.,"Claim: A viral WhatsApp video claims doing a few minutes heart massage and breathing exercises would increase blood circulation in two weeks. Verdict: This is disinformation. Experts say this massage will, at best, only provide psychological relief and does not affect blood circulation in any way. Full Text  Dubawa received a WhatsApp message which included a video on June 22, 2021, claiming that doing the massage routine in the attached video is capable of curing heart blockages. The message attached to the video claimed the procedure “had saved thousands from heart blockages” and that those who had tried it confirmed it cured them from “back pain” in “just seven days”. This message and video have been shared on numerous WhatsApp groups and private chats after that date. Screen shot of the WhatsApp message Dubawa watched the video produced by Austin Goh, who led the over three minutes exercise, explaining to viewers how to do the heart massage and breathing procedures that would increase blood circulation. He also added voice overs from time to time, noting what each procedure would help viewers achieve, and promising them relief if they practised the procedure for two weeks. Screenshot of the conclusion of the video Who is Austin Goh? Austin Goh, a Chinese born in Malaysia, is a self-proclaimed natural therapist who says he helps “people with chronic health problems get rid of their pain”. He was a martial artist who had an injury and defied medical advice to amputate. He claimed he rehabilitated his shattered knee by himself and has been helping people overcome health issues like chronic sinusitis since January, 1984. He teaches Wing Chun Kung Fu at Austin Goh Martial Arts Academy in London and has degrees in Physical Education and English Language from England. Austin Goh has a Youtube channel with 798 thousand subscribers and 388 uploaded videos.  Screenshot of Austin Goh’s Youtube Page The Video Dubawa searched for the blood circulation video and found that it was posted on Youtube on February 1, 2019 and it had been watched 6,411 times with 87 likes and only 2 dislikes.  Screenshot of the video description on Youtube Many viewers or subscribers believed it and asked questions on how they could maximise the benefits of the massage for blood circulation. Screenshot of a viewer asking questions about the exercise Another viewer commends the procedure and extolled its benefits S Screenshot of a subscriber commending the exercise We also have skeptics who doubt the procedure and shared their thoughts on Mr. Goh’s page. Screenshot of a doubtful or confused viewer’s comments Verification  Dubwa shared the video with two Consultant Cardiologists in Nigeria who both say there is no medical or scientific evidence to back Goh’s theory. Dr. Hassan Olayinka Olaiwola, a Consultant Cardiologist with Grandville Medical and Laser in Lagos State, Nigeria, says the procedure is pure fallacy and that rubbing or massaging the chest around the heart area does not affect or influence blood circulation. Dr. Olaiwola commented that “at best”, the exercise “would give the person doing it some psychological relief”. Dr. Sanni Saheed of Federal Medical Centre, Abeokuta, Ogun State, told Dubawa that he “watched the video to the end” and it is “pure disinformation”, arguing that “none of the actions in the video improves the cardiac function or blood flow”. Dr. Sanni said he knows people are eager to take care of their health and he therefore recommended walking for about 30 minutes daily, jogging, using the treadmill as scientifically backed exercises to help the heart. He says the exercises also “improve cardiopulmonary functions” which are the interrelationship between the workings of the heart and lung organs. Conclusion The internet is full of many self-professed natural health therapists who put the lives of their audiences at risk for psychological and financial gains. The claim by Austin Goh is false. Experts say this massage will, at best, only provide psychological relief and does not affect blood circulation in any way.

Claim: Some websites claim that the national cut-off mark for admission into the nation’s unity colleges has been pegged at 142.,"Unity Colleges were established by the Federal Government to foster National Unity and cohesion by bringing pupils from different parts of the country together in a school. There are 110 Unity Secondary Schools across the country. For primary school pupils who would like to transit to one of the 110 federal Unity colleges across the country, sitting for the National Common entrance examination is mandatory. Recently, a website servantboy.com released names of those it claimed got the highest score in the examination conducted on the 5th of June 2021 while claiming a new cut off mark of 142 had been set  “The national cut-off marks for 2020/2021 has been peg at 142,” the website claims. This report is being shared on various social media platforms and websites. One website, cater and merger consult shared a  similar story   that 142 is the new cut off mark.  shoolings.org published the same . Radio Nigeria visited the National Examination Council (NECO)’s website which is the examination body in Nigeria that conducts the Senior Secondary Certificate Examination, the General Certificate in Education in June/July and November/December respectively, and the National common entrance examination. According to NECO the 2021 National common entrance examination was written on the 5th of June 2021 with 76,855 students in 417 centres across the country comprising 37,300 males and 39,555 females. Lagos had the highest registration of 21,423, FCT followed with 8,674, Anambra with 5,730 candidates, and Zamfara with 4,855 candidates. To verify the claim, Radio Nigeria contacted the Head of Information, NECO Mr Azeez Sani, and he confirmed that the result is not out yet neither has the cut-off mark been pegged at 142. ‘’It’s completely fake…It’s fake, you know we have just concluded the marking, normally the process is after marking we submit to the federal ministry of education, the ministry will now release the result officially then they will now be the one to the fix cut-off mark. It’s not NECO’s responsibility to fix cut-off mark, ours is just to conduct the exam, mark, and submit to the ministry which we have not even done. So I don’t even know where they got that information,’’ he said. Mr Azeez said the result is usually presented to the Federal Ministry of Education before it is released to the public and the ministry is responsible for pegging the National Cut off Mark. Students are expected to download their results from the official website of NECO, however, a further check on the website also revealed that the 2021 national common entrance examination result is yet to be uploaded which indicates that the result is not yet out. Also, further checks on the website of the Federal Ministry of Education show that the 2021 cut mark has not been published.  Findings show that the cut-off mark for unity colleges has not been pegged at 142 as the examination result is not yet out therefore, the public should disregard the information published by the websites.

Claim: A news headline states that “JUST IN: AMCON seizes Buhari’s Properties“," Just a few weeks after Dubawa fact checked PM News for publishing a misleading headline which suggests President Buhari was shot dead in Edo State, a news headline also suggests that the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON) has seized President Buhari’s properties. On Wednesday, June 23, 2021, the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON) confirmed that it had seized the properties of a lawmaker, Senator Abdulfatai Buhari over his refusal to refund a ₦600m loan taken from Guaranty Trust Bank (GTB). Senator Abdulfatai Buhari took the loan in his company’s name, Abadat Ventures Limited. However, Politics Nigeria and NaijaNews.Com mischievously crafted their headlines in ways that could deceive readers to think that the ‘Buhari’ in question was the Nigerian president. Politicsnigeria.com says ‘JUST IN: AMCON seizes Buhari’s Properties’ while Naijanews.com says ‘AMCON seizes Buhari’s Abuja Properties’. The trope was duplicated on social media as the headline on Nairaland’s Politics section is also AMCON Seizes Buhari’s Properties. Screenshot of Politics Nigeria’s headline Screenshot of Naijanews.com’s headline  Screenshot of Nairaland’s headline News organisations, especially those online know that headlines influence news readers to click on story links. Bloggers and news organisations, therefore,  sometimes act unprofessionally by baiting readers with misleading headlines. For instance, Franktalknow.com shared a link on WhatsApp which states ‘JUST IN: AMCON seizes Buhari’s Properties’ but the headline changes to ‘JUST IN: AMCON seizes Senator Buhari’s Properties’ after readers click the story link. Some news audiences actually fell for the bait on Nairaland and assumed the ‘Buhari’ in question was the President. It is impressive to note that some other media organisations were more ethical in their reportage of the issue. RipplesNigeria, The Punch and Newspack all referred to the lawmaker as ‘Senator Buhari’ in their headlines to avoid ambiguities while The Cable did not use the name ‘Buhari’ at all but simply used this headline ‘N600m debt’: AMCON takes over Oyo senator’s properties in Abuja’. Researchers have found that a good number of media audiences just read the headlines and do not bother about reading the full story. So, using misleading headlines (to generate clicks) could help spread misinformation. ",senate,24/06/2021,https://dubawa.org/no-president-buharis-assets-not-seized-as-misleading-headline-suggests/
Claim: An article by Naija news lists some food which it claims helps lower blood pressure,"An article by Naija news, an online new platform, names some foods as diet that lower blood pressure. Some of these foods include; milk, egg, Banana, Dark chocolate and olive oil. “High Blood Pressure which causes stroke, hypertension and heart attack is quite prevalent in the society today because of anxiety and overthinking. But do you know that there are some foods that you can eat to lower blood pressure?” Excerpt of Naij news article. For milk, the report claims a daily dose of a cold glass of milk offers a solid serving of both calcium and vitamin D, nutrients that help lower blood pressure by 3 to 10 percent. The report also claims Egg whites are a solid source of protein, vitamin D, and other healthy nutrients can help reduce blood pressure, while eating a banana which is rich in potassium is better than taking supplements.  Also, the report claims dark chocolate is rich in antioxidants called flavanols, which make blood vessels more elastic and olive oil, which is an example of a healthy fat, contains polyphenols, which are inflammation-fighting compounds that can help reduce blood pressure. Dubawa conducted a keyword search on blood pressure, it’s types, causes and treatment. According to the Centre for Disease Control (CDC), blood pressure is the pressure of blood pushing against the walls of your arteries which carry blood from your heart to other parts of the body. Blood pressure is measured using two numbers called; systolic blood pressure (measures the pressure in your arteries when your heart beats) and diastolic blood pressure (measures the pressure in your arteries when your heart rests between beats). When measured it is the systolic pressure over the diastolic pressure. The normal blood pressure level is less than 120/80 mmHg.1. There are two types of hypertension; primary and secondary.  -Primary hypertension Primary hypertension also called essential hypertension, is a kind of hypertension developed over time with no identifiable cause. Factors that may play a role in this type of hypertension are; genes, physical changes, environment, etc. -Secondary hypertension Secondary hypertension often occurs quickly and can become more severe than primary hypertension. Several conditions like kidney disease, obstructive sleep apnea, congenital heart defects, problems with your thyroid, side effects of medications, use of illegal drugs, alcohol abuse or chronic use, adrenal gland problems, and certain endocrine tumours may cause secondary hypertension. The type of hypertension and its cause help your doctor determine the best treatment option. For primary hypertension, lifestyle changes may help reduce high blood pressure. Where this does not help, medication will be prescribed. For secondary hypertension, treatment will focus on the underlying condition causing high blood pressure. When hypertension persists, lifestyle changes are made and medications prescribed. NOTE: Treatment plans for hypertension often evolve as what worked at first may not work overtime. Doctors will continue to work to refine treatment. Healthline lists some home remedies for hypertension including a healthy diet (fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins like fish), physical activities, reaching and maintaining a healthy weight. Dubawa also reached out to experts on the efficacy of the foods mentioned in relation to blood pressure. A medical Doctor, Dr Lynda Effiong-Agim said the write up contained faulty facts and noted there are modifiable (factors you can control) and non-modifiable factors (factors you can’t control) in controlling blood pressure.  “There are medical sites one can actually get correct information. This is why not everything concerning health seen on the internet is true. Some may have some elements of truth but have other faulty facts in their write-ups. Just like I have spotted some faulty ones in this post. There is no specific food that their work is to lower blood pressure, however eating a healthy diet and having a good active lifestyle as well as avoiding some habits can help with prevention of or control of hypertension…all these ones are just modifiable factors, i.e the factors that one has control over to prevent hypertension or help in the control for those who already have. There are some other factors too which are not modifiable and by default make one more likely to develop hypertension.” Excerpt of Dr Lynda’s comment. She advised the public to consult medical personnel or hospitals as well renowned health site for health information noting that posts like this one can be misleading especially to those who do not have a medical background to be able to filter information. Another expert, a nutritionist, Ms Bernice Apemiye, said while it is true these food have the minerals listed by the article, there is no research on them helping to lower blood pressure. “I would say it’s partially correctly in respect to the fact these food sources have the minerals and vitamins stated but in respect to blood pressure, I haven’t read any research on a banana or milk lowering blood pressure. There are many factors that help in lowering blood pressure, not just one nutrient alone.” Excerpt of Mrs Bernice’ comment Conclusion This article is misleading as Dubawa’s findings and health experts noted that no specific food helps in lowering blood pressure but a healthy diet among other measures help.

"Claim: Ex-presidential aspirant and CEO of IPI Solutions, Adamu Garba, recently claimed that Crowwe, an online interaction app built by his company, is the first social networking platform in Nigeria and in Africa in a post on his Facebook page.","Claim: Ex-presidential aspirant and CEO of IPI Solutions, Adamu Garba, recently claimed that Crowwe, an online interaction app built by his company, is the first social networking platform in Nigeria and in Africa in a post on his Facebook page.   The claim is false. There have been other social networking platforms built in Africa as early as 2005.  Since its release in July 2020, the Crowwe app, developed by Gloomme Business Connection, a subsidiary of IPI Group Limited, has witnessed a lot of backlash from the Nigerian populace. On Google play store and Apple app store, Crowwe attracted a lot of disparaging remarks in the review section, largely due to Garba’s stance on controversial issues in the country’s socio-political landscape. An example is Garba’s stance on the Federal Government’s ban on microblogging platform, Twitter in Nigeria. While defending the government’s action, Garba had described the American microblogging and social networking service as “an insurrectionist tool” capable of undermining the sovereignty of the country. Also, in October 2020, during the nationwide #EndSARS protest, which was aimed at disbanding a unit of the Nigerian police force, Garba took a controversial stance by alleging that the protest had transformed into a political agitation capable of breaking law and order in the country while threatening to sue Twitter CEO, Jack Dorsey, for retweeting a link for donations to support the movement.   Screenshot of a review comment on the apple play store On June 14, 2021 it was observed the app was deleted from the Google Play store. Many had attributed this removal to the damning comments and low ratings on the app page, but the ex-presidential aspirant claimed that he was the one who asked Google to take down the app. In an interview with Punch, Garba claimed he asked Google to take down the app from Google Playstore because he needed to update the code. Garba stated that it was in a bid to make some improvements that he asked Google to take down the app. On June 15, 2021, Garba took to his Facebook page to give a personal explanation as to why there are a ‘million’ requests for his app to be taken off the playstore but maintained his former stance that the absence of the app on the play store had not resulted from low ratings. Garba listed five “crimes”, which he said, might be responsible for the backlash the app has received. However, in his listings, Garba mentioned that one of his “crime” was that his company built the first social networking application in Africa. His words, “…third Crime is that my company build the first social networking application in not just Nigeria but Africa, apparently, it did not suit the narrative that above all else, it was the Fulani man’s company that build (sic) the app…” In verifying the claim, Dubawa searched the internet for similar platforms that had been built in Africa over the years. It was first discovered that as early as 2005, South Africa already had a social networking application known as MXit which was built by Herman Heunis. Heunis was born in a rural area in Namibia. He moved to South Africa where he went to Stellenbosch University in 1977 and started his vocation in computer programming 3 years after. He founded Mxit in 2005, growing it from a small company with a team of eight into an African technological giant with more than 100 employees with users in more than 120 countries around the world.  South Africa, MXit, a free instant messaging application with an estimated 7 million users, was described as the most popular local social networking platform.  MXit, just like other instant messaging apps, has the ability to receive messages offline. For feature phones, they have group chats, chat tabs, and offline messages, all on data-light (technology that consumes 10 times less mobile bandwidth).  For iOS 7, Mxit 7 has features like doodle and voice chat. The company was however sold off in 2012 to Alan Knott-Craig Jr. It later closed down in 2015.  Despite being a web-based social networking platform, Afroterminal was founded in 2009 by two Africans in diaspora, Chioma Anyanwu and Charles Akpom.  It was an African-focused social network that would provide a single online platform for Africans around the world to connect, share news and relevant information regarding the continent, discuss ideas for the continent’s socio-economic development and build virtual and personal relationships over the long term.  It allowed memberships from diverse countries – with regular members hailing from all 53 African countries. Another social networking platform built in Africa was 2go. The application was developed by 2go Interactive (Pty) Ltd in Cape Town, South Africa. It was created in 2007 by some students of University of Witwatersrand. It supports over 1,500 different devices, including feature phones, in addition to Android, BlackBerry OS and BlackBerry 10 smartphones.  2go is a chat-based mobile social network targeting users in emerging markets, particularly in Africa.  2go users message each other for free, meet new people and share updates and photos with friends and family. In Nigeria, Yookos a Christian-focused website, was founded in 2011 by the leader of Christ Embassy International, Pastor Chris Oyakhilome, with the aim of conveying spiritual messages among members of Christ Embassy, in Africa. However, it penetrated beyond Africa as traffic steadily increased.  The website, thereafter, became popular and accommodated more people. In 2012, there appears to have been a deliberate push to extend the social network’s subscriber base beyond religion. Yookos was later developed into apps for smartphone devices where users can join communities, meet new people and follow topics of interest.  It also affords users a platform to buy and sell in their local marketplaces.  By 2015, the KingChat App was built as a fast, simple and personal smartphone messenger that allows users to send messages. It allows users to send and receive messages, pictures, audio, location and video messages. From research, there have been many other social media applications built by Nigerians in Nigerians and Africa, even though some of them stopped being operational after a while, many others are still functional. Crowwe is not Africa’s first social networking platform. There have been several social media applications built in Africa since 2005.

Claim: A viral infographic shared on WhatsApp has a claim that the World Health Organisation listed seven brain-damaging habits.,"A viral infographic on WhatsApp has a claim tagged ‘7 biggest brain-damaging habits’. These habits were said to have been identified by the World Health Organisation (WHO). These habits were listed as; missing breakfast, sleeping late, high sugar consumption, more sleeping specifically in the morning, eating while watching the Television (TV) or computer, wearing a cap/scarf or socks while sleeping, and blocking or stopping urine. The image which carries the logo of the WHO requests receivers to not just read but forward to as many people they care about. Dubawa first observed some grammatical errors like the fourth habit identified as “more sleeping specially at morning” instead of “especially in the morning”. Dubawa also noted that the instruction after the listed seven habits also lacked basic spacing, improper use of capital and small letters and the use of shorthand (“u” in place of “You”). This was a major red flag as such grammatical errors are usually not associated with a reputable international organisation like the WHO.  Dubawa went ahead to conduct a keyword search on brain-damaging habits which led to a report by Medicover hospital claiming the WHO has listed 10 brain-damaging.  This search also led to another report by Pharmiweb listing 7 brain-damaging habits to avoid similar to the one in the viral image. Our keyword search also led to checks in 2020 by rappler.com, quint, and Factly. Dubawa also reached out to the WHO. The organisation said that the message is unrelated to the organisation. “The message has nothing to do with WHO and WHO does not endorse it,” WHO replied. Having established this is a recirculated claim, Dubawa also tried to look at what brain damage is and how these habits individually lead to that. Brain damage is said to occur when a person’s brain is injured due to traumatic injury(a fall or an accident) or nontraumatic injury (such as a stroke). Brain damage is also seen as an injury that causes the destruction or deterioration of brain cells. There are two types of brain damage; traumatic and non-traumatic/acquired brain damage. NOTE: All traumatic brain injuries are head injuries but head injuries are not necessarily brain injuries. -Traumatic Brain Injury: is caused by an external force like a blow to the head that causes the brain to move inside the skull or damages the skull. This in turn damages the brain. -Non-Traumatic/Acquired Brain Injury: occurs at the cellular level. It is most often associated with pressure on the brain from a tumour or result from neurological illness like a stroke. Causes of traumatic brain injury include: car accidents, blows to the head, sports injuries, falls or accidents, gunshot won’t and physical violence. Non-traumatic/acquired brain injury is caused by: poisoning or exposure to toxic substances, infection, strangulation, choking, or drowning, stroke, heart attacks, seizures, tumours, aneurysms, neurological illnesses, and abuse of illegal drugs. According to WebMD, things to avoid to prevent brain injuries include; never shake a child, install window guards to keep young children from falling out of open windows, install shock-absorbing material on playgrounds, wear helmets during sports or cycling, wear a Q-collar while playing contact sports, wear seatbelts in cars, and drive carefully, avoid falls by using a step stool when reaching for high items, install handrails on stairways, don’t keep guns (if you do, keep them unloaded and locked away), don’t use illegal drugs, drink alcohol only in moderation, and never drink and drive. Claim 1: missing breakfast A study on Chinese workers revealed that skipping breakfast or eating a low-quality breakfast have a negative effect on cognitive function but this does not imply brain damage. Another study on children noted that although no statistically significant improvement was observed in task performance, significantly higher activation was recorded in the frontal, premotor, and primary visual cortex areas in the breakfast trial relative to the fasting condition. These studies show some effects of skipping breakfast but none of it speaks to brain damage making the claim false. Claim 2: sleeping late An article by Healthline noted that sleep deprivation or sleeping less than the required seven to nine hours drains mental ability and has long term effects. Also, another study reviewing different studies revealed that both short and long duration of sleep is significant predictors of death in prospective population studies. This claim is false because although fewer sleep hours have been noted to have some negative effect on a person’s health, it does not lead to brain damage.  Claim 3: high sugar consumption An article by Verywellmind notes sugar has drug-like effects in the reward centre of the brain and that sweet foods along with salty and fatty foods can produce addiction-like effects in the human brain which can lead to the loss of self-control, overeating, and subsequent weight gain. A 2013 study showed consumption of a high glycemic index (GI) compared with a low-GI test meal increased the activity in brain regions related to food intake, reward, and craving in the late postprandial period, which was coincident with lower blood glucose and greater hunger. Another study showed sweet foods can be more addictive than cocaine while a 2016 study showed researches that suggest high sugar consumption causes inflammation in the brain, leading to memory difficulties. All of these studies did not however point to brain damage whihc makes this claim misleading.  Claim 4: more sleeping specifically in the morning  Healthline article on sleep and the required amount of sleep does not show any issue with what time of day an individual sleeps more as long as they are not sleep-deprived. Claim 5: eating while watching the Television (TV) or computer  Healthsite.com advises against eating while watching TV because it distracts the brain and leads to eating more but this has nothing to do with brain damage. Claim 6: wearing a cap/scarf or socks while sleeping leads to brain damage is brain damaging The WHO spokesperson, Matt Taylor noted that there is no correlation between wearing socks or cap to sleep and brain damage. “Wearing a cap, scarf or socks while you sleep DOES NOT cause brain damage.” Excerpt of WHO’s response. Also, this article by Healthline notes some benefits of sleeping with socks which is necessary for cold regions. Claim 7: blocking or stopping urine is brain damaging This article by medical news today notes while it is necessary to hold urine sometimes when this becomes a habit, it can cause pain, lead to Urinary Tract Infection (UTI), bladder stretching, damage pelvic floor muscles, and kidney stones. Another article by MSD manuals also noted that urine blockage leads to kidney stone, infection, kidney damage, etc.  Brain-damaging habit claims in the infographic are false as our findings show this is a recirculated infographic, no data or research that links these habits directly to brain damage and the WHO has also denied it originated from them while noting the claims are not true.  Actually, the sixth claim got my antennas standing. I knew it wasn’t legit. Thanks for the information.

"Claim: A viral video resurfaced on Friday, 18th June 2021 claiming the Nigerian Army had dealt a heavy blow on bandits who abducted students of FGC Birnin Yauri in Kebbi State, northwest Nigeria. The video showed men of the Nigerian Army dragging and piling dozens of corpses, allegedly of bandits.","Claim: A viral video resurfaced on Friday, 18th June 2021 claiming the Nigerian Army had dealt a heavy blow on bandits who abducted students of FGC Birnin Yauri in Kebbi State, northwest Nigeria. The video showed men of the Nigerian Army dragging and piling dozens of corpses, allegedly of bandits.     The viral video is misleading as it is a 2016 video which resurfaced and is being circulated to sell a narrative that the Nigerian Army dealt a heavy blow to bandits who abducted students of FGC Birnin Yauri in Kebbi State.    Gunmen on Thursday, 17th June 2021 raided the Federal Government College, Birnin Yauri in Kebbi State, northwest Nigeria and abducted dozens of students and teachers in broad daylight. The Police command in Kebbi State, through its spokesperson, Nafiu Abubakar had said the gunmen killed a Police officer and shot one student who was receiving treatment. The number of students abducted is uncertain as some of the teachers said as many as 80 students were abducted. By the next day, the Nigerian Army spokesperson , Onyema Nwachukwu, said in a statement that troops tracking the kidnappers had found one female student dead in the forest but rescued five students and two teachers. He said the Nigerian Army troops operating under the auspices of ‘Operation Hadarin Daji’ who had been in pursuit of the bandits had rescued the students and teachers after a fierce exchange of fire with the criminals. “The rescue followed an initial encounter with the abductors in the early hours of today (Friday) June 18th, 2021 after trailing the kidnappers from Yauri through Riyao to Sombo community, where the abductors who had split into two groups fled, with one group conveying the abducted children, while the second group conveyed rustled cattle,” he said. A BBC Hausa report of 18th June had quoted residents of Sakaba in Birnin Kebbi saying Nigerian security forces killed at least 80 bandits during an ambush around Makoko village and the corpses were being piled near a primary school. The revelation prompted many Nigerians to take to social media to link the army’s alleged success against the bandits with a video showing what appeared to be Nigeria’s security forces piling corpses.  Social media users further linked the video to a statement made by President Muhammadu Buhari during a live media chat with Arise TV on June 10th where he said he had given the military and police the order to be ruthless against bandits terrorizing the northwest. The president had stressed that: “We are going to treat them in the language they understand. We have given the police and the military the power to be ruthless. You watch it in a few weeks’ time there will be a difference.” Flex Dino Kempes with 2,157 friends on Facebook posted the video on his page with the caption: “When the president said that we will soon start getting the results of his speaking to those causing problems in the country in a language they will understand very fast in the coming weeks, he wasn’t joking, results has started flying in from the northern part of the country.” “Over 200 Bandits have been killed within the week and the count keeps on increasing with each passing day. Kebbi and Niger are becoming too hot for the Bandits to operate in. Fire on Nigeria Army, we are solidly behind you.” He stated while posting a video that showed men of the Nigerian Army piling corpses,” he wrote.  Bello Aliyu Wamako also posted the same video on his Facebook page with the caption: “83 suspected bandits were killed by the Nigerian Army.” A user on Twitter, Mubarak Umar (@Mubarack_Umar) posted the video with the tweet: “Nigerian troops vs bandits.” while other users such as Abimbola King (@Harbimborlar) and EL.Farouq Sarkinoma (@ESarkinoma) retweeted the videos.  This reporter observed that the video that has gone viral on social media appeared in two lengths. One was a 2 minutes 50 seconds video while a second version of the same video was shortened to 59 seconds. The video showed soldiers who appeared to be men of the Nigerian Army scattered around an arid area dragging and piling corpses. Twenty-five seconds into the video, a voice in the background could be heard saying, “yes I can see you guys working,” while other soldiers made small talks in Hausa and English languages as they dragged corpses scattered around the vicinity to a spot. At about one minute eight seconds into the video, the man making the recordings said to his colleague: “Nna, enh, I fear yesterday. I swear to God, wetin fear me be say suicide bomber dey pass…” Nna is an Igbo originated word meaning man.  At one minute 33 seconds into the video, while the corpses were being piled up, the man behind the camera said in Hausa: “asa wani bisa wani (pile them on top of each other) while another soldier said: “Taya za musa” (We’ll use tires). The person recording the video could be heard saying: “ina tayoyin ne yallaboi” (where are the tires sir?). The soldiers continued with talks on how to get firewood to burn the corpses and at two minutes 46 seconds, one of the soldiers who attempted to fire shots at a corpse was reprimanded by a senior officer who told him not to waste his bullet on a corpse. This reporter first observed that the video appeared to have been shot in an arid area with soldiers appearing in the Nigerian Army desert camouflage used for combat operation in the northern part of the country.  The Nigerian Army had in 2016 launched the harmonized military desert and woodland camouflage uniform with all arms of the military wearing the same camouflage uniform. While the desert camouflage is designed to blend with the terrain in the northern part of the country, the woodland camouflage is adopted for the terrain in the south.  This reporter also conducted a keyframe analysis of the video using various reverse image search engines such as TinEye, Google reverse image search and Yandex. While TinEye did not produce any useful result, Google reverse image search showed that the video had been retweeted several times in the last few days.  Using Yandex reverse image search, this reporter found that the same video had appeared in 2020 and was posted by EngHausa24 with the caption: “Wannan videon ance shine abunda ya faru yau a dajin Rugu dajke karamar hukumar Danmusa a jihar Katsina.” (This video is said to be what happened today in Rugu forest in Danmusa local government area of Katsina State).   A screenshot of the video posted by EngHausa24 in 2020  Still using Yandex, an earlier version of the same video was posted by Samba Galaxy in 2016 with the caption: “You need to watch and share this. What our soldiers encounter and go through to protect our lands. Viral it goes.”  A keyword search also led to the video which was posted but now deleted on tori.ng in 2016 with the caption: “Dead bodies everywhere! See what soldiers did to Boko Haram members.” Further explanation about the video had stated that: “A video footage from the northeast shows Nigerian Military men dragging bodies of slain Boko Haram fighters. The Nigerian forces seem to be winning the war. This Fact check concludes that the viral video of men of the Nigerian Army seen dragging and piling corpses of alleged bandits who kidnapped students of FGC Birnin Yauri is misleading as the video first appeared online in 2016. Therefore, the video could not have been connected to the latest alleged onslaught on bandits in the northwest.

Claim: Urine is useful in improving one’s eyesight,"Urine therapy is the use of human urine for pharmaceutical or cosmetic purposes, including drinking of one’s own urine and massaging one’s skin or gums and cleaning the eyes with one’s own urine. Over the years, researchers have come up with different benefits of urine therapy. However, no scientific evidence exists to support any beneficial health claims of urine therapy. Claims on urine therapy seem to be rearing its head once again especially on social media. Such claims became popular in 2011 with the emergence of a private Facebook page named “urine therapy: the real universal remedy” with over 7.4 thousand members. Recently, A Facebook user Olagundoye Babatunde raised a conversation on the use of human urine to clean the eyes for better eyesight. Various YouTube videos have also been made stating that urine therapy can restore one’s eyesight. One of such is gotproductions with the links and here which has garnered over 200,000 views. Also in QUORA, an American question-and-answer platform, a question was asked ‘Does urine therapy improve eyesight’ and an anonymous reader answered the question in the affirmative, which has 2.2 views. Although, most people are keying into urine therapy, there is no scientific evidence or research that exists which supports any beneficial claims of using human urine to wash one’s eyesight. A medical practitioner, Victor Adefesoye said human urine is a bodily waste which contains two major components, the urea (from amino acid metabolism) and water. Dr Adefesoye said he doubts the efficacy of recycling the human urine as a remedy for treating an ailment adding that urine contains urea which is a complex compound of ammonia that is highly irritating to the skin and that is why urine has a pungent smell. He said the reason why urine is not too damaging is the fact that water, which is its major component dampens the effect of ammonia in the urine thereby making it less corrosive. He opined that for one to use urine as a therapy or cure for the eyes, such a person is just causing more damage to the eyes. He added that trying to recycle urine as a remedy for treatment is not safe. Meanwhile, an optometrist, Dr Anthony Momoh said the eye is the most fragile organ of the body and applying urine to it is not safe at all. Dr Momoh revealed that applying urine to the eye erodes the conjunctiva which is a tissue that lines the inside of the eyelids and covers the sclera (the white of the eye), which in turn leads to corneal ulcer or corneal abrasion and eventually irreversible blindness. And as such, using human urine to clean the eyes for better eyesight is not medically advisable. The claim that using urine to wash the eyes aids good eyesight is not medically advisable and is therefore misleading. ",misleading,22/06/2021,https://dubawa.org/no-urine-does-not-improve-eyesight/
Claim: Viral image of a gun woman is being paraded on Facebook with captions suggesting her to be Senator Nyonblee Kangar-Lawrence,"Senator Nyonblee Kangar Lawrence (LP, Grand Bassa County), the Political leader of the Liberty Party, has for weeks come under intense scrutiny over a viral image circulated on Facebook by several users. The image shows Mrs. Agnes Taylor, Charles Taylor’s ex-wife, flanked by a woman attired in a military outfit with a long gun on her right shoulder.  Facebook posters have suggested that the woman carrying a gun in the photograph is Senator Kangar-Lawrence, who chairs the Liberian Senate’s Committee on Rules Order and Administration. The picture went viral at a time when advocacy for accountability for widespread and systematic violations of international human rights and humanitarian law that characterized two brutal armed conflicts between 1989 and 2003 have heightened in weeks. Earlier, Nimba County Senator, Prince Johnson, who according to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s (TRC) report bears some of the greatest responsibilities of the wars accused Senator Kanger-Lawrence in the plenary of the Liberian Senate of being a rebel fighter. A Facebook user by name Adama Senatorbiney Cousin Fofana posted on the image with the caption: “Nyonblee Kangar Lawrence in a situation she can’t handle”. His post was followed by two others, one from a popular block named- Pepper Bird and another account named RDTV. What was surprising to many was a post  with the same image from Ms. Wade Williams, a former desk editor of FrontPageAfricaNewspaper who now resides in the United States. Wade posted to Facebook a cropped version of the viral image tagging Senator Lawrence as “bodyguard” during the wars.  According to Mrs. Agnes Reeves Taylor, the former wife of Charles Taylor (the woman standing on the right in the photo), the picture was taken at Du-side Hospital, which is located on the Firestone Rubber Plantation in Margibi County on August 17, 1990, by a French photographer named Patrick Robey.  In an interview with this reporter on Friday, June 11, 2021, she confirmed that Robey took the picture outside of Du-side Hospital compound just before she could embark her vehicle upon her return from the hospital, to identify wounded soldiers who were moved to the hospital for advance treatment. She said she could recollect the event and date of the picture because the French photographer who took the picture issued a statement to explain events surrounding the controversial image in her trial in the UK on accusation of torture. Asked if the woman standing on her left was Senator Nyonblee Kanagar Lawrence, as stated by Facebook users, she replied “no”.  “That lady in the photo making rounds on social media is Cecelia Lewis, who later became Chief of Taskforce of the Liberia National Police in the administration of Charles Taylor and not the Grand Bassa County Senator,”  Taylor said. Ms. Lewis later died in a plane crash along with police Director Joe Tate and several others on Wednesday, August 11, 1999.  The former wife of Charles Taylor, however, indicated that it was a security strategy to have Lewis dressed in a military outfit like her so that soldiers could be wondering who Agnes Taylor really was. Madam Lewis is survived by her son Enreki Johnson. Due to the intense discussion of her late mother’s picture, he took to Facebook on May 17, 2020 asking that her late mother be left alone to “rest in her grave.”  Based on the evidence available, the woman carrying a gun in the viral image posted on Facebook by many users is not Senator Nyonblee Kangar Lawrence of Grand Bassa but Madam Cecelia Lewis Johnson who later died in a plane crash in 1999.

Claim: A user on Twitter claims that: “Russian-based Biafran Builds Nuclear Missile.”,"Nuclear weapons  of mass destruction were used during World War II. The most horrendous incident involving the use of nuclear bombs was the bombardment of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by the United States. As a result  of its fatal power, and expensive cost of production,  the United Nations banned the production of the  bomb. Nonetheless, some countries such as the United States, Russia, France, China, Britain, Pakistan, India, Israel, Iran, and North Korea still have and continue to develop them. Yet, notwithstanding the reality around the production of the Nuclear weapon and the fact that it is only available in  few advanced nations, a Twitter user, Kingsley Uba Dike (@uba_dike) claims that a Russian-based Biafran has not only built a Nuclear missile but has also named it the ‘Biafran Satan 404’. The post amassed over a thousand interactions with multiple comments that appear to be in agreement with the idea.   A user, Ejimchi (@Ejimchi) commented that “Now they know nwanne, for arewa to advised death buhari to let Biafra go if they want to, I believe they know. But Fulani janjaweed cabal feel that they are very stubborn, but they will know how far in near future. They think that 1967 is the same with 2021.” While other users dismissed the claim others appeared frightened about it all.   Biafra was a region that roughly correlates with Nigeria’s current South East geopolitical zone. In May 1967, Biafra declared its independence from the rest of the country. A civil war followed. It is estimated that 500,000 to 3 million people died from disease, starvation and the conflict itself. Biafra’s defeat in January 1970 ended the war. However, the Biafran separatist movement continues, most notably in the activism of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), an organisation led by the exiled Nnamdi Kanu. Nigeria’s South East is said to be mainly populated by Igbo people. When members of the separatist movement say “Biafrans”, they generally mean the Igbo. On Nairaland, a popular Nigerian-based interactive website, the ‘radio Biafra’ shared the same claim with more details attached to it.   The post also reappeared on ‘Africa Status’ (a new site) with the same heading and narrative as the one one Nairaland. So also on Pinterest, where the post seems to have enjoyed a reasonable viewership.  Even more findings by DUBAWA revealed that the claim has been published on over 30 different blogs.  Dubawa first conducted a Yandex Reverse image search on the purported image of the nuclear image built by the Biafran. Results show that the image was taken out of a different context to forge a new and bogus narrative.  While the original image of the missile had no Biafran flag attached to it, the one under scrutiny was doctored to add up the Biafran flag and the text ‘Republic of Biafra’. Image 1: Acclaimed image under scrutiny, depicts the nuclear missile said to have been built by a Russian-based Biafran. Image 2: depicts the actual source and narrative around the image as shared on the Business insider 7 years ago. The missile neither carries the flag of Biafra, nor the text ‘Republic of Biafra’. The missile on the picture was neither built by a ‘Biafran’ or any other entity related to the secessionist state. In fact, the image was originally taken when the  deactivated Soviet-era SS-4 medium nuclear-capable ballistic missile was displayed at La Cabana fortress in Havana, Cuba on October 13, 2012. The story behind the missile dates back to the 13-day missile crisis that began on Oct. 16, 1962, when then-President John F. Kennedy first learned the Soviet Union was installing missiles in Cuba, barely 90 miles (145 km) off the Florida coast. After secret negotiations between Kennedy and Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, the United States agreed not to invade Cuba if the Soviet Union withdrew its missiles from the island. The same missile that is now attached to a bogus new narrative.  This claim is false. The purported image was originally taken when the  deactivated Soviet-era SS-4 medium nuclear-capable ballistic missile was displayed in 2012 and not made by a Biafran as claimed.

Claim: A viral WhatsApp message claims that the LASTMA has advised users of public transports to beware of drivers mentioning lace and ankara during a phone call.,"Overtime, terms like ‘Incessant killings’, ‘kidnapping’, ‘Gunmen’, etc have become prominent in the Nigerian media space and this is owing to the increasing rate of Insecurity across the country. Accompanying these trends is the influx of false claims around the topics, many of which Dubawa has fact-checked. (See here.) This became a trigger for verification when a recent WhatsApp message with the indication ‘Forwarded many times’ claims that the Lagos State Traffic Management Authority (LASTMA) has warned the public to look out for suspicious phone calls by drivers when using the public transportation systems. The viral message purports that kidnappers have adopted the words ‘Lace and Ankara’ and translated them to mean ‘male and female’ respectively, hence, when a driver mentions any of these words, passengers should ‘quietly alight immediately.’ How do you quietly alight from a moving vehicle?  The last few words from the message advise readers to share the information further and identify the announcer of the message to be the LASTMA protectorate unit. Is there such unit in the agency?  In the bid to check this claim, Dubawa’s first point of contact was the Lagos State Traffic Management Authority (LASTMA) which allegedly initiated the Broadcast Message. In response to enquiry by DUBAWA, LASTMA’s Public Relations Officer, Mr Olumide FILADE, said the message did not originate from LASTMA, adding that there is no ‘protectorate unit’ in the agency. Further, Dubawa performed a keyword search which led to other sources of this information. Results show that asides WhatsApp, this message has been shared several times on Facebook; the earliest result was from 2019. The post has garnered over 2000 interactions across the social media platform. However, while the results provided by CrowdTangle show this message, none of them attributed it to the LASTMA. While many may see this post as providing important security information, it proves baseless as there’s no sufficient evidence to back its claims. Besides this, the information is not new; it has been in circulation since 2019 and findings have shown that it has falsely attributed its claims to the Lagos State Traffic Management Authority.

"Claim: A viral WhatsApp voice note making the rounds had announced the death of the national leader of the All Progressives Congress, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu.","Claim: A viral WhatsApp voice note making the rounds had announced the death of the national leader of the All Progressives Congress, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu.  Bola Tinubu is not dead. He was only out of the country and had already returned on Tuesday night. On Tuesday, June 15, 2021, a WhatsApp voice note started circulating. In the short clip, a voice could be heard saying Tinubu has died. According to the audio clip, Tinubu died at a hospital in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. The speaker, who appeared to be one of those agitating for secession, was also heard congratulating his listeners that one of their “enemies” had died. He also mentioned other prominent Nigerian leaders that could possibly die in a few months to come. The unidentified speaker said in Yoruba, “Good morning everyone, I am happy to announce to you that our enemies are gradually dying. God has taken the life of one of the people disturbing Yoruba land. Tinubu is dead, he died in Dubai, that’s the news I got just now.  “We are overcoming our enemies, the curses are working, Tinubu just died in Dubai now. We will surely overcome all our enemies. We will get to the promised land, they will die one after the other, those left are Obasanjo and those kings.” The audio has sparked wide speculations on social media over the rumoured death of the politician who just celebrated his 69th birthday barely three months ago on March 28. Social media users on Facebook and Twitter have also shared reports of Tinubu’s death as the information keeps spreading like wildfire. It was observed that handlers of social media accounts with the tag ‘Biafra’ rejoiced at the news. Another Facebook user converted the audio clip obtained that initially propagated the news and converted it into audio. Dubawa placed a call across to Tunde Rahman, the media aide to Tinubu, who confirmed that his boss just arrived in Nigeria on Tuesday night with pictures attached.  He, however, did not state which country Tinubu arrived from and the reason for his travel. Also, credible national media organisations debunked the news stating that Tinubu was expected back to Lagos by Tuesday. The viral claim that Bola Tinubu is dead is false as he just returned from France on Tuesday evening. He only travelled out of the country for a while.

"Claim: Nigeria’s Daily Post newspaper, on June 13, 2021 published a news story which claimed that former president Olusegun Obasanjo “has again written an open letter to President Muhammadu Buhari about the current state of the nation”.","Former President Olusegun Obasanjo ruled Nigeria as a civilian president for two terms (May 29, 1999 to May 29, 2007). That is apart from his time as a military ruler from 1976 to 1979.   Mr. Olusegun Obasanjo has come to be known to write letters to incumbent presidents who occupy office after him. He wrote an open letter to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan in 2013. He has also written three letters to President Muhammadu Buhari since his assumption of office as a civilian president (first in January 2018, second in January 2019 and a third in July, 2019). Dubawa read the contents of all three letters written by Former President Olusegu Obasanjo to incumbent President Muhammadu Buhari and observed that the alleged ‘new’ letter by Daily Post is exactly the same as Obasanjo’s 2019 letter. There is no difference whatsoever in the contents, arguments and wordings of both letters. Dubawa also called Mr. Kehinde Akinyemi, the Special Media Assistant to Mr. Olusegun Obasanjo on Sunday, June 13, 2021 and Mr. Akinyemi confirmed that his principal did not write a new letter to President Muhammadu Buhari in June, 2021. This is not the first time that individuals and news organisations would recycle old letters from Mr. Olusegun Obasanjo as recently published.  On March 3, 2021, New Wave Reporters published a post claiming Obasanjo had written a new letter to President Buhari. Africa Check fact checked the story with a verdict that it was false. Facebook has also tagged the post as false information. The news story by Fikayo Olowolagba of Daily Post claiming that former President Olusegun Obasanjo “has again written an open letter to President Muhammadu Buhari about the current state of the nation” is false and misleading. The writer merely recycled a previous letter from July, 2019. Apart from recycling old letters, there have also been reports of creating ‘fake’ letters allegedly by Mr. Obasanjo. In October 2011, the BBC claims that the Nigerian Police arrested four journalists after Mr. Obasanjo “accused them of publishing a letter with a forgery of his signature”.

Claim: A news headline outlines that “JUST IN: Buhari Shot Dead By Gunmen In Edo”,"Headlines are crucial in telling a news story. Misleading headlines and sometimes half-truth carved captions have misinformed and even misdirect people’s sense of reality.  Even notably, a recent headline reads, “JUST IN: Buhari shot dead by gunmen in Edo”. It was first shared on PM NEWS and reappeared on ther platforms carrying the same headline.  As expected, the headline drew serious attention from the public who thought the story was referenced to the President, Muhammadu Buhari.  On Facebook, the post attracted multiple comments. A user, Nasiru Mohammed, wrote, “God forbid, death at your door but not our president”. Several other users questioned, “which of the ‘Buhari?”  Another user, James Kamar remarked that “Oh my God, this is a bad way for the president to die. May his soul rest in peace.” While the headline did amass traction, the narrative was nothing more than a usual news story.  The Buhari in question was a driver with Hartland Construction Company. Simply identified as ‘Buhari’, he was reported to have  been shot dead in Benin, the Edo state capital, by Unknown gunmen believed to be kidnappers. According to PMNews, two police operatives on guard duty were also shot at by the gunmen, before kidnapping an expatriate worker.  Although the event took place, the president’s name in the headline gave the story rather unusual attention. While some users took time to read the actual narrative others took it as it was; the president is dead!!! Headlines tell what a story is about. Nonetheless, in this case, the headline is rather misleading as the Buhari in question is not the President but a driver.  The narrative goes to show that many Nigerians are lazy readers. They don’t go beyond reading the caption, which, in itself, is supposed to draw their curiosity and attention.  When the caption says Buhari shot dead in Edo, a diligent reader will go further than the caption to know when, where and under what circumstances, before jumping into conclusion. The headline has not in any way misled anyone, lack of diligence in reading did. At least a Buhari died, whether “simply identified as” or real name. The bottom line is that he is known as Buhari, a general and common name. Readers should rather learn to be diligence at reading. Pray, if that were an examination, will they give excuses for not reading to the end to know who the victim is?

Ganiyat Tijani-Adenle,"Ganiyat Tijani-Adenle Claim: A viral WhatsApp message titled ‘FESTUS KEYAMO DROPS THE MOTHER OF ALL BOMBS – Who are you calling dictator?’ names Nigeria’s Minister of State for Labour and Employment, Festus Keyamo, the author of a critical message seeking to launder the image of the country’s president. This message is misleading. Nigeria’s Minister of State for Labour and Employment, Mr. Festus Keyamo is not the author of the message.  The battle of wits between the supporters of incumbent Nigerian president, Muhammadu Buhari, and his antagonists is one that goes on daily on social media. Nigerian citizens in the country as well as those in diaspora spare no efforts in proving their cases for or against the President. In this particular instance, pro-Buhari author(s) sought to give their claims credibility and thus labelled it as crucial information by the country’s Minister of State for Labour and Employment, Mr. Festus Keyamo. The message has been shared several times on WhatsApp. Mr. Festus Keyamo, a lawyer, Senior Advocate of Nigeria, social commentator, critic, human rights activist and columnist is a supporter of President Muhammadu Buhari and a member of his cabinet. He was also the Head of Communications for his presidential campaign team.  The Minister of State for Labour and Employment’s name was also signed at the end of the message. Dubawa read the 30 paragraph-long message which sought to highlight alleged deficiencies of immediate past presidents Goodluck Jonathan and Olusegun Obasanjo, who are both members of the opposition party, the People’s Democratic Party (PDP).  Ex-President Goodluck Jonathan was in power for five years (2010 to 2015) while former President Olusegun Obasanjo ruled as a civilian president for two terms (May 29, 1999 to May 29, 2007). That is apart from his time as a military ruler from 1976 to 1979. The viral message however only cited alleged abuses of power during Ex-President Obasanjo’s civilian administration. The message also cites many supposed virtues of President Muhammadu Buhari (and his administration) as well as extolled the competence of his appointed officers. Dubawa sent a text message to Mr. Festus Keyamo on June 16, 2021 to confirm if he was the author of the message and the Minister replied that while he shared some of the views in the message, he did not author it. Mr. keyamo said the message “had been circulating since 2018 during the campaigns” of the election that won President Muhammadu Buhari his second term in office, and that the contents of the WhatsApp message are “a sprinkling of a lot of things” he said as the “Director of Communications during the campaigns”. Mr. Keyamo also noted that the author(s) of the message actually “pieced them together and added a bit of some other things” which he had not said. He therefore confirmed that the viral message in its current form is not from him. Nigeria’s Minister of State for Labour and Employment, Mr. Festus Keyamo is not the author of the viral WhatsApp message titled ‘FESTUS KEYAMO DROPS THE MOTHER OF ALL BOMBS – Who are you calling dictator?’ Individuals who wish to share ideas and have them resonate with people have been known to write the names of celebrities, specialists, authority figures and prominent institutions as the sources (of such messages) in order to gain credibility and achieve their communication goals.

Claim:  A viral WhatsApp message urges Nigerians to take part in free Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) company registration online with benefits attached.,"Mischievous elements have continued to prey on citizens’ desires for freebies deceiving them that the CAC is giving out catchy and mouth-watering benefits to lure people to click a link to enable them to enjoy such freebies. A viral WhatsApp message urges Nigerians to apply for the free CAC registration online with the benefits of 50,000 and others attached.  Screenshot of the WhatsApp message FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS APPROVED All SELF EMPLOYED AND BUSINESS OWNERS TO CARRY OUT THEIR C.A.C (CORPORATE AFFAIR COMMISSION) REGISTRATION ONLINE FREE OF CHARGE BENEFITS OF C.A.Cs are -Free N50,000 cash from FG -Certificate of Incorporation -Legal Liability Protection -Free International Trade -Continuity -Free Trip to UK -Reputation With Customers -Getting on FG Record. ENROL NOW https://bit.ly/Free_CAC_Registration However, this is not the first time such false claims of freebies by government institutions will emanate in public platforms. Similar claims have been fact checked and were disproved by Dubawa. When Dubawa accessed the link,  the logo on the page was similar to the logo on the page of the CAC but it was noticed that the logo is faint in colouration while the one on the original website is bold. See below the picture of the Logo… Upon clicking on an icon, the page directed to another where bio data and name of company to be registered was displayed The next page returns the message, ‘congratulations your CAC certificate will be ready shortly.’  The next stage on the application has pictures of beneficiaries without any information on how to contact them to assert if the claim of their benefit was genuine.  After this comes the last page which reads “cac-registration.get-fundz.xyzsays..Thank you for your comment. It will be posted after review.” This is the last message that appear, then applicants are asked to share to different groups they belong.  Dubawa checked the official website of CAC, disclaimer page and the commission’s social media handles to see if  it was posted on the page but it was not there. Dubawa also made a call to the customer care service of CAC to inquire about the claim; the respondent said it was false. Furthermore, Dubawa used the google search to see if media platforms published information on the freebies but no such report was found. The claim that the Federal Government is doing free online CAC company registration with benefits is false and misleading. The fact check was produced per the Dubawa 2021 Kwame Karikari Fellowship partnership with the National Orientation Agency NOA to facilitate the ethos of the “truth” in journalism and enhance media literacy.

Claim: Viral WhatsApp messages claim “American Visa Lottery Online Registration 2021 Now Open”.,"Social Media platforms with special reference to WhatsApp have seen the vigorous circulation of a claim that the American Visa lottery registration process for 2021 is ongoing. The caption claiming that the registration process is now open comes along with captivating and enticing messages asking people to take advantage of the chance to live in the United States by clicking the link attached to the message and standing a chance to earn a United States Green Card which offers endless opportunities if lucky enough to win one. The message has been consistently shared on WhatsApp groups and as compelling as the United States Electronic diversity Visa program may be to a large number of people, the message of American Visa Lottery registration has been forwarded to groups several times and people have manifested interest to apply for it on some WhatsApp groups. In verifying the claim, we noticed, first, that the very link attached to the message asking people to click it and register could not pass Dubawa’s website test approach. With some people having already clicked the attached link and complaining they could not find what they were looking for, we adopted the ScamDoc platform that analyzes websites to check whether they are legit or not. Scam Doc maintained from its analysis that the domain of the links for registration needs some more investigation done on it. The link after being clicked will take you to the section that seeks personal information. The possible end result will be to ask you to share multiple times to various WhatsApp groups to stand a chance of winning.  The US Diversity Visa Program is not an automatic selection process that assures a GreenCard by simply forwarding messages to groups, there are set criteria. Secondly, apart from the very lucid red flags on the domain link, Dubawa did some checks on the social media handles of the United State Embassy and the body in charge of the Diversity Visa Lottery Program under the US Department of State, Bureau of Consular Affairs. What was noticeably glaring is that the United State DV program has specific timelines as to when application resumes and closes. Based on data gathered from the State Department Bureau of Consular Affairs website on the last registration process which took place in 2020, it is boldly stated that “The DV-2022 Diversity Visa program registration period was between October 7, 2020 and November 10, 2020.” The information on the website further states that “Since 1994 the DV program has already been executed three times in February, once in November and several times in October”.  Whilst we acknowledge that there could be possible changes to timelines, we can authoritatively state that such changes have not occurred at this particular time as the 2021 and 2022 registration processes have been closed as stated on the Website. Lastly, Dubawa checked the United States Embassy Twitter and Facebook pages in Sierra Leone as they are known for informing the public on the start of registration and guiding people through the process. The registration process maintains a two years interval wherein applications for 2021 lottery can be done in 2019 and 2022 done in 2020 as can be found on the website. So what is expected to start in October 2021 is for the 2023 lottery process. The deadline for the 2021 process had elapsed long ago and what is going on right now is Status check. Further, the US Department of State – Bureau of Consular Affairs has warned prospective applicants to be mindful of such scams. The viral message claiming that there is an ongoing American Visa Lottery is false. What the Bureau of Consular Affairs presents yearly is the US Diversity Visa Lottery and it is a process that spans from October to November, not an America Visa Lottery.

Claim: President Muhammadu Buhari takes delivery of the first ever Nigeria-made cell phone called ITF Mobile.,"On Wednesday, June 10, 2021, the internet went agog with photos and news reports of president,  Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.)receiving the first made in Nigeria phone known as ITF mobile.  Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Otunba Niyi Adebayo, while presenting the phones to the president just before the Federal Executive Meeting tagged it as the first ever to come out of the country. Adebayo explained that the phone was one of the 12 produced, using locally sourced components, by the Electrical/Electronics Technology Department of the Industrial Training Fund’s Model Skills Training Centre. He was quoted to have said, “Twelve indigenous mobile cell phones produced by the Model Skills Training Centre of the Industrial Training Fund; an agency under the Ministry of Industry Trade and Investment, were launched. “It gives me great pleasure Mr President, to present you with one of the phones.” The reports went viral on various social media platforms as people kept sharing and reposting.  ITF mobile Using a keyword search on Google and other search engines, it was discovered that before Wednesday, a number of Nigerians have come up with certain mobile phones tagged, ‘Made-in-Nigeria phones.’ One of them was a report in 2017 by Technologytimes.ng  that listed some made in Nigeria phones available in the market amongst which are;  Solo Aspire 3,Ankara K2 and Plirisblazex-64.  Aspire 3 smartphone was manufactured by a Nigerian tech company, Solo, which was formed in 2012 by a group of telecoms professionals led by Tayo Ogundipe, a Nigerian-born ex-senior global executive with HTC and Sony Ericsson, the report stated.  The Ankara K2 smartphone was launched by a Nigerian device maker, Imose Mobile around early 2015. The smartphone comes in two colour variants of black and white and supports dual mini SIM. Plirisblazex-64 smartphone was manufactured and released into the tech market in 2015 by Pliris Mobile Limited, a Nigerian tech company, founded by Oluwafemi Alade.  Also, on April 25 April 2017, The Guardian published a report stating the emergence of the first ever made-in-Nigeria phone by AfriOne. The report partly read, “ More than 15 years after Nigeria joined the global system for mobile communications, the first made-in-Nigeria phone has finally debut, thus throwing the country into the growing league of communication gadgets manufacturers.  AfriOne mobile phone “The phone, which components are sourced and assembled locally, serves as a technological breakthrough and precedent for the country. “The handset, which is coming from the stable of AfriOne Limited, a technology-driven enterprise, is poised to standardise the use of technology in Nigeria, offering affordable innovation and removing barriers to large scale adoption of advanced technology.” Also, in the report, the Founder and Chief Executive Officer, AfriOne, Sahir Berry, at the inauguration of the plant,  was quoted  to have said that the  manufacturing plant in Lagos, serves as a pioneer in the manufacturing and assembling of high-end communication technology in the African space. “AfriOne champions corporate socio-economic development, while wholly supporting the ‘Made-in-Nigeria’ mantra. The company models products that utilise cutting-edge technology reflect a modern, sleek design and integrate the latest and arguably necessary financial technology such as mobile health, mobile education and mobile banking. This is all with the goal of facilitating connectivity among Nigerians and the rest of the world,” Berry said. However, the immediate past president of the Association of Telecommunications Companies of Nigeria and the National Coordinator for the Alliance for Affordable Internet, Olusola Teniola, told our correspondent in a phone interview, there was no record of any made-in-Nigeria phone, adding that what was available were phones that were assembled in Nigeria.  Speaking to Sunday PUNCH, he said the record must be set that there was no made-in-Nigeria phone. Teniola said, “ The first thing is the phone that the government is calling made-in-Nigeria is actually assembled in Nigeria because there is no phone that is globally recognised to have been manufactured in Nigeria.  “The phone that was showcased by the  minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Otunba Niyi Adebayo, is just an example of other phones that have been assembled in Nigeria.”  The Information Technology expert stated that the components that make up the phone were not manufactured in Nigeria; but are imported. “There is no record of any phone fully manufactured in Nigeria yet,” he added.  Teniola further explained that , “The component that makes up the phone and the screen were packed by other technology companies outside Nigeria. Nigeria can only claim to have assembled the phone. There is no record of any indigenious phone that was built bottom-up in Nigeria.” Teniola said that he was aware of some companies assembling phones in Nigeria just like AfriOne clarifying that the firms only assemble but don’t manufacture phones.  “What they do at AfriOne is the assembling of component parts like others, but  they do not manufacture. Afrione is one of those who have been able to produce an assembled featured phone.” Teniola said the innovation by ITF was a “welcome development” to assemble a locally made phone.  This he said would, “make the choices widely more available to consumers in their locally assembled  phone.”  The tech guru said in Nigeria for now, “we do not have the capacity to produce the components that make up a mobile phone.” “ We don’t have that capacity until we are able to fabricate the chips and components that make up high-tech technology devices. Maybe in the future, we may be able to do more than assemble and manufacture our own phone in Nigeria, but for now we are not there yet,” he stated. Another search by our correspondent  revealed that some components of a mobile phone include a circuit board, microphone, display, speaker, sim card holder, buzzer, vibrator, monitor battery, antenna, etc. Amongst these, the circuit board acts as the brain of the device as it helps in the overall functioning of the phone by converting digital signals to analog and vice versa. There is a difference between assembling and manufacturing. It’s a common misconception amongst people which makes it easy for many to misconstrue both terminologies. An engineering website,  Axenics.com ,explained the difference between the two terminologies stating that assembly encompasses the steps of constructing a finished product from components or partially-compiled units. Assembly results in assemblies and/or sub-assemblies that are ready for sale and or implementation by a customer. Manufacturing on the other hand, encompasses the process of production from raw or semi-raw materials through to a finished product ready for sale.  From all facts and evidence, ITF mobile is neither the first made-in-Nigeria nor a first assembled-in-Nigeria phone.

Claim: Senator J. Gblehbo Brown says no President has moved into Liberia’s executive mansion since the killing of President William R. Tolbert,"J. Gblehbo Brown who represents Maryland County in the Liberian Senate on Thursday, June 10, 2021, said at a peacebuilding and reconciliation event that since President William R Tolbert was murdered in the executive mansion, no other president has been able to move into the mansion.  Senator Brown chairs the Liberian Senate’s Committee on Internal Affairs, Reconciliation, and Governance. He was invited to speak on behalf of the senate at the launch of a report which borders on national reconciliation, peacebuilding, and social cohesion, an effort led by the Civil Society National Reconciliation Working Group. The report, launched under the theme “Rethinking Reconciliation and Social Cohesion in Liberia”, is seeking efforts that can lead to an overall process of post-conflict reconstruction and development (PCRD).  “It appears that Liberians do not know what to do with this TRC (Truth and Reconciliation Report) report,” he said. “To have genuine conciliation and sustained peace, we must establish the root cause of the wars.” “Liberians have been divided from the foundation of the nation…Tolbert was killed in his bed in that executive mansion and since then, no other president has been able to move into that mansion,” Senator Brown said. The executive mansion of Liberia is the official residence and workplace of Liberia’s Presidents. Dedicated on January 3, 1964, during the presidency of William VS Tubman, it is situated across the street from the Capitol Building in central Monrovia.  On April 12, 1980, a non-commissioned officer of the Armed Forces of Liberia and members of his Krahn ethnic group, attacked the executive mansion in a bloody coup d’é tat and murdered President Tolbert in his bedroom which was located on the eighth floor of the mansion’s residential complex. Thirteen of Tolbert’s cabinet ministers were also killed in the aftermath of the coup. From April 12, 1980, the day Master Sergeant Samuel K Doe launched his coup d’etat, he occupied the executive mansion until he was murdered by Prince Johnson’s rebel forces at the Freeport of Monrovia on September 9, 1990, Monrovia.  In this Facebook live interview with journalist Clarence Jackson of Okay FM Liberia, Mrs. Nancy Doe, the wife of Samuel K Doe indicated the family had lived in the mansion. “All our time in the executive mansion, we never anticipated that this would happen,” she said. In this documentary by the BBC Sound, titled the “Death of Samuel Doe”, former BBC correspondent Elizabeth Blunt narrated how Doe had left the executive mansion for the Freeport of Monrovia for a meeting with an ECOMOG commander when Prince Johnson’s forces arrived.  From April 12, 1980 when Doe overthrew Tolbert and was elected president in October 1985, he resided in the executive mansion. This can further be confirmed by a New York Times July 7, 1990 publication where the US-based newspaper reported that he had told American diplomats that he would resign, but so far he had shown no sign of leaving.  After the Samuel K Doe regime ended in 1990, Charles Taylor became the second elected President of Liberia after Toblert and he was inaugurated in office on August 2, 1997. Taylor worked from the executive mansion even though he was not resident there.  Charles Taylor held official duties in the executive mansion ranging from hosting foreign guests and other state functions, even though he was resident at two houses in Congo Town. BBC reporter Bobin White is quoted in this article as saying: “I first met Taylor face-to-face in the Executive Mansion in Monrovia in 2000.” The paper is quoted as saying “throughout the day, the 40-year-old President remained barricaded inside the executive mansion. Armored vehicles and soldiers were stationed on the palace lawn.” President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf was elected President of Liberia in October 2005, the third democratically elected president after Tolbert who also moved into the executive mansion  From January 2006 to July 26, 2006, former President Sirleaf did all official business in the executive mansion until a portion of the mansion on the fourth floor was destroyed by fire during the 159th-anniversary celebration of the adoption of the Liberian Declaration of Independence. President Sirleaf was at the time feting foreign guests and dignitaries in the gardens of the Executive Mansion.  The renovation process is still ongoing. It is fair to state that President Goerge Weah is the only elected president who has not been able to work from the executive mansion. From the analysis and investigations relating to the claim made by Maryland J. Gblehbo Brown, it is clear that the claim is false. Even though Presidents Charles Taylor and Ellen Johnson Sirleaf did not reside in the executive mansion, the conclusion that no President has moved into the mansion since the murder of President William R. Tolbert is false.

Claim: A Twitter user shared an image claiming Kenyans stood with Nigerians during the June 12 protest.,"Claims are still pouring in after the June 12 protest on Nigeria’s Democracy Day. One of such claims sent to us for verification was a Twitter post by Free Mdude (@_iAlen) claiming Kenyans stood with Nigerians during the June 12 protest. This post contained the image of a group of protesters holding up the Nigerian flag. “KENYANS standing with NIGERIANS during #June12thProtest in NAIROBI.” Excerpt of @_iAlen’s TwitterTwitter post caption. The post, which  was made on June 12, 2020, had generated 147 comments, 6,175 retweets and 9,026  as of Monday June 14, 2021. Dubawa first tried to trace the Twitter post by @_iAlen in the screenshot shared with us and found it. Afterward, Dubawa conducted a Twitter search which led to other Twitter posts. One post by God’s Jewel (@linaeyen) making reference to @_iAlen’s post, made the same claim. Another Twitter user Naija PR Assistant (@starblog3a1) also shared a post using the same image with a similar claim. “KENYANS standing with NIGERIANS during #June12thProtest in NAIROBI thanks so much together freedom is assured”  Excerpt of @starblog3a1’s Twitter post caption Dubawa then conducted a google reverse image search which led to a report by Premium Times with the image during the October 2020 EndSARS protest. Also, a close look at the image showed the image bore the name tag of Premium Times reporter, Kabir Yusuf. Dubawa, therefore, reached out to Mr Yusuf to confirm the location and time of the image. Mr Yusuf confirmed he took the image during the EndSARS protest in Abuja. “It is not accurate. I took the picture during the EndSARS protests in Abuja.” Excerpt of Mr Yusuf’s response. The Twitter post depicting this image as that of Kenyans standing with Nigerians during the June 12 protest is false and misleading as the picture is from the 2020 EndSARS protest in Abuja.

"Claim: The former President of the United States, Donald Trump, in a congratulatory message to Nigeria over the recent Twitter ban, claimed Twitter banned President Muhammadu Buhari.","Claim: The former President of the United States, Donald Trump, in a congratulatory message to Nigeria over the recent Twitter ban, claimed Twitter banned President Muhammadu Buhari.  Twitter didn’t ban President Muhammadu Buhari. Twitter only removed a post made by the President. On Friday, June 4, 2021, the Nigerian government suspended the operations indefinitely in the country the persistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria’s corporate existence. The suspension came days after Twitter deleted a post by President Muhammadu Buhari where he had condemned the attacks on police stations, prisons and offices of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in the South-East, warning that those supporting insurrection and violence in the country would be “treated in the language they understand.” The tweet reads: “Many of those misbehaving today are too young to be aware of the destruction and loss of lives that occurred during the Nigerian Civil War. Those of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand.” This suspension has brought about a lot of reaction from Nigerians and also the international community. On Tuesday, June 8, 2021, the former president of the United States, Donald Trump, in a statement, congratulated Nigeria for banning the operations of Twitter in the country. Trump also encouraged more countries to do the same. Trump, in his statement, claimed Twitter banned President Muhammadu Buhari. He wrote: “Congratulations to the country of Nigeria, who just banned Twitter because they banned their President. More COUNTRIES should ban Twitter and Facebook for not allowing free and open speech – all voices should be heard. “In the meantime, competitors will emerge and take hold. Who are they to dictate good and evil if they themselves are evil? “Perhaps, I should have done it while I was President. But Zuckerberg kept calling me and coming to the White House for dinner telling me how great I was.” It can be recalled that in January 2021, Twitter and Facebook suspended the accounts of Donald Trump, following the January 6 attack on Capitol Hill. The platforms claim he mobilised his followers to invade Capitol Hill over the outcome of the November 2020 presidential election after he lost. Dubawa started by checking the official Twitter handle of President Muhammadu Buhari (@MBuhari) to see if his account has been banned or deactivated but found nothing of such. Also, he is still recognised as Nigeria’s President as stated on his bio in the verified handle. As of Wednesday, June 9, the President’s account is active with 4.1 million followers. Further checks showed that his last tweet was on June 1 and all is still intact except for his controversial post which was removed. Twitter has some rules and policies to ensure all people can participate in the public conversation freely and safely.  A Twitter user can be banned or permanently suspended if found guilty of the risk of further incitement of violence. For instance, the former president, Donald Trump, was banned on Twitter, following his tweet which led to the January 6 attack on Capitol Hill. Twitter, in a press release, explaining why Trump was banned, said: “After close review of recent Tweets from the @realDonaldTrump account and the context around them — specifically how they are being received and interpreted on and off Twitter — we have permanently suspended the account due to the risk of further incitement of violence.” According to Twitter, when a user is removed from the platform, such user is permanently removed no matter the position such user holds in the public. Twitter’s chief financial officer, Ned Segal, in an interview on CNBC after Trump was banned, reiterated that Twitter has policies in place to “make sure that people are not inciting violence” and, if someone’s content does that, they will be removed from the platform. “When you are removed from the platform, you are removed from the platform, whether you are a commentator, you’re a CFO, or you are a former or current public official, he said. In President Buhari’s case, he violated Twitter’s “abusive behavior” policy which led to the removal of the post and suspension of his account for 12 hours. The consequence of violating this rule is linked to a number of factors including, but not limited to, the severity of the violation and an individual’s previous record of rule violations.  In twitter’s judgement, Buhari has not done what could warrant a ban, hence, his account was not removed from the platform. The claim by the former president of the United States is false. Twitter didn’t ban President Muhammadu Buhari. Twitter only removed a post made by the President.

"Claim: Shehu Sani, a Nigerian politician, tweeted that some students were kidnapped in Ondo State.","Shehu Sani, a former senator from Kaduna state in Nigeria, tweeted on Thursday that some students were kidnapped in Ondo State. “The report of the abduction of schoolchildren in Ondo is another tragic news. The kidnapping of students has become a pandemic.” Recently, there have been incessant cases of kidnaps across the country, including those of school pupils fueling agitation across the country.  Expectedly, Sani’s tweet gained momentum quickly on the micro-blogging social network, Twitter, with some of his followers spreading the information at a rapid rate.  The tweet, which has the tendency of reaching the 1.9 million people who follow the senator, started gaining engagement barely one hour after it was posted. It already has 164 retweets and 742 likes as of 9:22 p.m. on Thursday. Some of the comments under the posts were in affirmation of the senators’ tweet.  One of those who tweeted was Emmanuel Nweze (@EmmanuelNweze10) who wrote, “@ShehuSani, Kidnapping of children in Nigeria has become a very big business of Fulani terrorists in the land so is no more a news beau’s Government of Nigeria is Supporting them by paying them money”  Another commentator under the post, Chegwe Ezenwa (@ChegweEzenwa), wrote, “@ShehuSani, This is the kind of pain that parents are being subjected to on a daily.

On 20 April, 2021, at least 20 students and two staff members were kidnapped in Greenfield University, Kasarami, Chikun LGA, Kaduna State. Between April 23 and 26, five of the students were killed. Earlier on Friday,  February 26 2021, more than 300 schoolgirls were kidnapped by unidentified gunmen from their boarding school in Jangebe, Zamfara State. On February, 17,2021, at least 42 people, including 27 students, were kidnapped in Kagara, Niger state, a report by The Nation Newspaper stated.  In 2014, 276 schoolgirls kidnapped in Chibok by Islamist militants Boko Haram brought global attention to the scourge of raids on schools in Nigeria but the most recent attacks are suspected to be the work of criminal gangs. According to several news reports, a staff member of a Chiomola private school, Omolayo Ojo, was abducted by some gunmen in Ondo State on Thursday morning.  The staff member of the school, which is located at Oba Ile Estate, Akure North LGA of Ondo State, was whisked away after gunmen hijacked a bus belonging to the school.  The incident occurred in the morning around 7am, while the driver and the abducted staff were moving around town to pick up pupils of Chiomola school. Several reports including the one by Punch reported that  only a staff member of Chiomola private school, Omolayo Ojo, was abducted by the gunmen. Speaking to journalists, as replicated by Sahara reporters,  Ojo said the gunmen threatened to harm her if she did not cooperate with them. She added that she was taken to an unknown destination but later found her way back to Akure after asking for directions from people she met on her way. In an interview, the Principal of the school, Mrs Bolatito Akindemowo, confirmed that no pupil was abducted during the incident, adding that security operatives had been briefed of the incident. “This has never happened to our school before. However, the staff that was kidnapped has been released but we are yet to find the school bus. We have reported the incident to the police,” the principal stated. To further verify this claim by Senator Shehu Sani, Dubawa correspondent reached out  to the Ondo State Police Public Relations Officer, Mr Tee-Leo Ikoro, in a phone interview. He stated that there was no abduction in the state. He added that there was only a case of vehicle snatching.   “There was no case of abduction. It was just a case of vehicle snatching by some of our hoodlums. They didn’t even abduct the lady.  “It was not a case of abduction not to talk of going away with school children. People are just spreading false information all over the place. Immediately the incident happened there was panic in the atmosphere and you know that once there is panic, people will begin to say all sorts of things they are not sure of,” he added. Based on the evidence available and credible news reports, Senator Sani’s tweet is false and misleading.

"Claim: Multiple sources have portrayed Nigeria’s new Chief of Army Staff, Major General Faruk Yahaya, as the 26th Chief of Army Staff (COAS) but the Nigerian Army claims he is the 22nd.","Claim: Multiple sources have portrayed Nigeria’s new Chief of Army Staff, Major General Faruk Yahaya, as the 26th Chief of Army Staff (COAS) but the Nigerian Army claims he is the 22nd. The claim that the new Chief of Army Staff (COAS), Major General Faruk Yahaya, is the 26th COAS is false as findings show that the nomenclature COAS only came into existence in 1975, thus making Lt. General TY Danjuma the first COAS and General Yahaya the 22nd. On Thursday 27th May 2021, Major General Faruk Yahaya assumed command as Nigeria’s new Chief of Army Staff after the demise of his predecessor, Lieutenant General Ibrahim Attahiru, who died on May 21st 2021 in an air crash in Kaduna, alongside 10 military officers and crew.    The Nigerian Army had issued a statement by its Director, Army Public Relations, Brigadier General Mohammed Yerima, announcing the passing away of Gen Attahiru stating that the COAS was enroute Kaduna from Abuja when the unfortunate incident happened. The Chief of Army Staff is the highest-ranking military officer of the Nigerian Army and the position, often occupied by the most senior commissioned officer, is appointed by the Nigerian President.  On May 27, President Muhammadu Buhari appointed Major General Faruk Yahaya as the Chief of Army Staff (COAS). Until his appointment, Gen Yahaya was the Theatre Commander, Operation HADIN KAI, which is responsible for Counter Terrorism and Counter Insurgency operations in the North East of Nigeria. Some online media outlets such as Fast News, Opera News and Society Gazette as well as Nigerians on social media had portrayed General Yahaya as the 26th COAS, but the Nigerian Army on the 28th of May 2021, announced that Major General Faruk Yahaya had assumed command as the 22nd COAS at the Army Headquarters (AHQ) in Abuja. However, controversy arose as to whether the present COAS is the 22nd or 26th Chief of Army Staff to hold the office and serve as Nigerian Army’s most senior officer.  The same designation was replicated on social media. A user on Twitter, Angela Davis (@angeldaviesblog) wrote: “How Major General Faruk Yahaya became Nigeria’s 26th COAS.”  Another user, 774NGR (@774_ngr) also wrote on  Twitter: “There is now a new man at the helm of affairs in the Nigerian Army. He is Major General Faruk Yahaya, and he is the 26th Chief of Army Staff since the Military first got a taste of political power back in January 1966.” On the website of the Nigerian Army, under the office of the COAS, the profile of the immediate past COAS, Lt. General Ibrahim Attahiru, had him addressed as the 20th and in another instance as the 21st COAS, further complicating the issue. This has left many Nigerians wondering what number the present COAS is. In our quest to verify the various claims, it became important to start with the history of the Nigerian Army which dates back to 1863 with Lt. John Glover’s local force which became known as the “Glover Hausas” and later the “Hausa Constabulary.” It later became the “Lagos Constabulary” and on incorporation into the West Africa Frontier Force (WAFF) in 1901, became known as the “Lagos Battalion.” According to the Nigerian Army website, the British Government had already included the Royal Niger Company (RNC), Constabulary Force in Northern Nigeria in 1886 and the Oil Rivers irregular in 1891 into the WAFF. The WAFF led to the merger of all units into regiments in each of the dependencies and this produced the Northern Nigerian Regiment and Southern Nigerian Regiment. The 1914 amalgamation of Nigeria which brought the Northern and Southern Protectorates together also unified the Northern and Southern Regiments to become the Nigerian Regiments. However, the Nigerian Regiment was renamed the Queen’s Own Nigerian Regiments (QONR) in 1956 during the visit of Queen Elizabeth II and in the same year, the regionalization of the WAFF came into existence and each military force became independent of the other. According to the Nigerian Army, the QONR became the Nigerian Military Force (NMF) and by 1st June, 1958, the British Army Council in London relinquished control of NMF to the Nigerian Government while in 1960, when Nigeria became independent, the NMF became known as the Royal Nigerian Army (RNA). The RNA changed to the Nigerian Army in 1963 when Nigeria became a republic. Several online records have portrayed Kenneth G. Exham as Nigeria’s first General Officers Commanding (GOC) followed by Major General Norman Foster, then Major General Christopher Welby-Everard and Major General Aguyi-Ironsi who was the first indigenous GOC. This is also corroborated by a report published by The Premium Times in 2014 titled: “General Minimah, his Opobo ancestry and the burden of history,” written by Eric Teniola. Based on the report, Nigeria at that time had 28 COAS including the early British GOC’s. The report portrayed Lt. Col. Yakubu Gowon as the first COAS followed by Lt. Col. Joseph Akahan, Maj. Gen. Hassan Usman Katsina, Maj. Gen. David Ejoor, Lt. Gen. Theophilus Danjuma, Lt. Gen. Ipoola Alani Akinrinade, Lt. Gen. Gibson Jalo, Lt. Gen. Mohammed Inuwa Wushishi, Maj. Gen. Ibrahim Babangida, Lt. Gen. Sani Abacha, Lt. Gen. Salihu Ibrahim and Lt. Gen. Aliyu Gusau Mohammed. Others include Maj. Gen. Chris Alli, Maj. Gen. Alwali Kazir, Lt. Gen. Ishaya Bamaiyi, Lt. Gen. Victor Malu, Lt. Gen. Alexander Ogomudia, Lt. Gen. Martin Luther Agwai, Lt. Gen. Owoeye Andrew Azazi, Lt. Gen. Luka Yusuf, Lt. Gen. Abdulrahman Bello Dambazau, Lt. Gen. Onyabor Azubuike Ihejirika as well as Maj. Gen Kenneth Tobiah Minimah. Since Minimah, Lt. General Tukur Buratai has held the position before he was replaced in January 2021 by Lt. General Ibrahim Attahiru who has now been succeeded by Major General Faruk Yahaya, making the list 31. Other online documents show that it was  not until 1966, under then Lt. Col Yakubu Gowon that the official designation of Chief of Army Staff (COAS) came into existence, therefore referring to Lt. General Yakubu Gowon as Nigeria’s first COAS. With this, between 1966 and 2021, it can be verified that Nigeria has had 26 Chiefs of Army Staff (COAS) with late Lt. General Ibrahim Attahiru as the 25th and Major General Faruk Yahaya as the 26th COAS. Using oral records from senior military officers of the Nigerian Army and archival records, however, it was verified that what is today referred to as the Nigerian Army officially came into existence in 1963 after it changed from the Royal Nigerian Army. Within that period, Major General Christopher Welby-Everard became the first GOC of the Nigerian Army between 1963-1965. He was replaced on 9th February 1965 by General Aguyi-Ironsi who served as the GOC until 16th January 1966. However, further verification revealed that General Yakubu Gowon who took over in 1966 from General Ironsi was not referred to as GOC or COAS; instead, he was referred to as Chief of Staff Army. “Gen. Yakubu Gowon, Lt. Col. Joseph Akahan, Maj. Gen. Hassan Usman Katsina, and Maj. Gen. David Ejoor were each referred to as Chief of Staff Army (CSA), not Chief of Army Staff (COAS),” said the Director, Army Public Relations, Brigadier General Mohammed Yerima when contacted.  A chronicle of the Nigerian Army Command published in the 2021 diary of the Nigerian Army corroborates this. This makes Lt Gen. T.Y. Danjuma the first COAS. Between Lt. Gen. T.Y. Danjuma and Lt Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru, there have been 21 COAS, making Major General Faruk Yahaya Nigeria’s 22nd COAS.      The claim that the new Chief of Army Staff (COAS), Major General Faruk Yahaya, is the 26th COAS is incorrect as the nomenclature, COAS only came into existence in 1975 during the administration of General Ramat Murtala Mohammed when he appointed General T.Y. Danjuma to be the first COAS. Therefore, General Faruk Yahaya is the 22nd COAS as findings have shown.

Claim: Viral Image attributed to ChannelsTV claims a policeman shot a protester in Abuja.,"On Saturday, 12th of June, 2021, Dubawa came across a Facebook post by Adaeze Adaobi under the trending hashtag – #june12thprotest. The post which came with an accompanying image reads, “Am hearing that A Nigerian police shot at unharmed peaceful protester today #june12thprotest.” The attached image showing a policeman aiming at protesters and a Channels TV watermark was used to circulate the claim that a policeman was shooting at a protester. While this post in isolation has 3 likes and 9 comments, Dubawa, with the aid of CrowdTangle, a social media monitoring tool, found several other Facebook pages that have published the image with this caption: ‘A policeman shoots at protesters in Abuja on June 12, 2021. Sodiq Adekunle channels television.’ The other Facebook pages include blogs, influencers and celebrities. As of the time this fact check is written, the post had garnered over 25,000 interactions on Facebook. Dubawa is aware that fake news thrives on trending topics and is skeptical of the viral image especially with the consciousness of the practice of recirculating old images as new, falsely attributing images to authoritative sources and taking images out of context. Dubawa started its search using the Google Reverse Image tool, which shows that the image originated from Channels Television as claimed by the various Facebook pages that shared it.  Since the origin of the image has been established, Dubawa proceeded to Channels Television’s official website and Facebook account, where it found a similar but contradicting headline/caption; while the viral caption read ‘A policeman shoots at protesters in Abuja on June 12, 2021. Sodiq Adekunle channels television,’ the post on the official website and the Facebook account reads: ‘A policeman shoots teargas at protesters in Abuja on June 12, 2021. (Photo: Sodiq Adelakun/Channels Television)’ Considering that Facebook, unlike Twitter, allows users to edit their posts and the availability of various digital manipulation tools for internet users, this researcher guessed accordingly and looked further to confirm the presented hypothesis. Before now, Facebook used to publicly indicate that a post has been edited by placing an ‘Edited’ label next to the post’s date, nonetheless, this Edited tag has now been hidden. Well, not entirely as users can still access it by clicking and tapping on the three dots (menu) located at the upper-left corner of a post and select View edit history. Dubawa followed the process explained above and found that Channels TV actually made the post but edited the caption about an hour later to include ‘Teargas’.    Dubawa’s findings show that while the viral image originated from Channels Television, there is a miscommunication in the image and this is owing to an error in the initial caption attached to it on ChannelsTv’s Facebook page which was later edited to reflect the actual incident. While the viral claim made it seem like the police shot the protester with a gun, the correction made by the TV station suggests that the police shot teargas not live bullets. It is evident in this fact check how the omission of a single word can send an entirely different meaning from what’s intended. It is also evident how fast misinformation spreads. Dubawa advises patience when sharing and receiving information. ",bullets,13/06/2021,https://dubawa.org/viral-image-depicting-police-officer-shooting-at-protesters-fact-checked/
Claim: A Twitter user claims the Retweet button on Twitter has been changed from blue to green in solidarity with Nigeria,"Amid the June 12 protest which is being promoted largely on Twitter, a Twitter user (@ChibuzorUkwu) claims Twitter’s Retweet button has been changed from blue to green in solidarity with Nigeria. “Twitter has changed the retweet button colour from blue to green in solidarity with Nigerians on #June12thProtest”. Excerpt of Twitter post caption.  While some users in the comment section say the Retweet button has always been green, others say their’s is still blue. Dubawa conducted a Keyword search which led to a 2016 report by  Independent announcing that the Twitter Retweet button had been changed from forest green to a much brighter, minty green shade. This search also led to a Twitter post in 2016 by Matt Navarra (@MattNavarra) noting this change just as the Independent reported. There is no new change to Twitter’s Retweet button as it has always been green.  Even when it was changed in 2016, it was from one shade of green to another and the change was in no way connected to Nigeria. This makes the claim false.

Claim: A viral video claims two persons survived the plane crash that killed Nigeria’s Army chief.,"Earlier in May, Nigeria’s Army Chief, Lt-Gen Ibrahim Attahiru, was killed alongside 10 other officers in a plane crash in Kaduna State. This led to several claims including the claim that 2 persons survived the crash. A 30seconds video which was being circulated on different social media platforms was sent to Dubawa by one of its partners for a fact-check.  “This video purported that 2 people escaped unhurt from the CoAS crashed plane.” Excerpt of comment shared along with the video on WhatsApp A witness in the video said two persons survived the crash using parachutes. “The thing happen, they de up, as the thing happen from up, Nahim the aeroplane burn. Them comot with those things parachute they hold am like this, two of them…” Excerpt of the narrator’s comment. Dubawa first observed the video had two trademarks/icon on the top left and the bottom right. Dubawa found the first trademark or icon on the top left to be the icon of Voice Tv Nigeria. The second icon on the bottom left of the video was that of a video editing Application(App), InShot which shows the video had undergone some form of editing using by the App. Dubawa also conducted a Keyframe analysis of the video using the Invid tool and different reverse image searches. The Google reverse image search did not produce any related or useful result. Also, a Bing search did not yield any useful results. Same result was gotten with Yandex and TinEye. Dubawa went ahead to conduct a keyword search which led to a 6 minutes 25 seconds video on Voice Tv. This video shared in 2018 was on the Nigerian Air Force Jet crash in Abuja. Dubawa finds the viral video misleading because as the plane crash the eye witness was speaking of was that of the Nigerian Air Force Jet crash in Abuja in 2018 not the kaduna military plane crash that claimed the life of the major general and other officers.

CLAIM 1: A Twitter user claims UNICEF said any efforts to block children from accessing pornography might infringe their human rights.,"CLAIM 1: A Twitter user claims UNICEF said any efforts to block children from accessing pornography might infringe their human rights.   CLAIM 2:  A website report shared by the Twitter user claims UNICEF said pornography is not always harmful to children. UNICEF in its report explained that though there are different kinds of risks and harms that have been linked to children’s exposure to pornography but there is ‘no consensus’ on the ‘degree’ to which pornography is harmful to children.  A Twitter user, Anitabook.com (@JackPosobiec), on May 31, 2021, tweeted a report from an online medium, C-fam.org, which claims that the United Nation’s International Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF) report says pornography is not always harmful to children. His tweet was accompanied by a caption saying: “BREAKING: UNICEF says any efforts to block children from accessing pornography online might infringe on their human rights.” The tweet has so far garnered over 3,500 retweets, more than 1,000 comments and over 3,500 likes as of Friday, June 4. Further checks show that several Twitter users have shared the same post quoting the same medium.  Checks by Dubawa show that the report was hinged on an April 2021 report published by UNICEF. The report titled “Digital Age Assurance Tools and Children’s Rights Online across the Globe” explores the relationship between children’s rights, business and the Internet. The report also addressed central themes, including children’s rights to privacy, freedom of expression, information, education and non-discrimination. UNICEF in its report explained that there are different kinds of risks linked to children’s exposure to pornography but that there is no consensus on the degree to which pornography is harmful to children. The report reads in part; “Access to pornography at a young age is linked with poor mental health, sexism and objectification, sexual aggression and other negative outcomes. “The evidence suggests that some children appear to be harmed by exposure to some kinds of pornography at least some of the time, but that the nature and extent of that harm vary. There is conflicting evidence regarding how many children worldwide are accessing pornography online, and how often.  “Some studies have found that boys are more likely to experience greater exposure to pornography at an earlier age, and they are more likely to be exposed to violent or abusive images such as rape, whereas girls are more likely to be subject to involuntary or problematic exposure.” UNICEF also notes that its conclusion is based on an online study from 19 European countries which claims that most children who saw saw sexual images online “were neither upset nor happy, ranging from 27 per cent in Switzerland to 72 per cent in Lithuania; between 10 per cent and 4 per cent were fairly or very upset; and between 3 per cent of children (in Estonia) and 39 per cent (in Spain) reported feeling happy after seeing such images.” UNICEF further explained that in Europe, restricting children’s access to certain kinds of pornography online is generally considered a legitimate aim by governments, whereas in the US, this is seen by the courts as an infringement of constitutional rights to freedom of speech, while in many other countries, pornography is entirely illegal. Checks show that UNICEF has taken down the report from its website and has replaced it with an edited report. Even though UNICEF has deleted its initial report and replaced with an edited report, the claim that the organisation said pornography is not always harmful to children is misleading. Instead, what UNICEF said in its report is that there is no agreement to on the degree to which pornography is harmful to children. It, however, didn’t state that any efforts to block children from accessing pornography might infringe their human rights, thus making the claim misleading. The researcher produced this fact-check per the Dubawa 2021 Kwame KariKari Fellowship partnership with The Nigerian Tribune to facilitate the ethos of “truth” in journalism and enhance media literacy in the country.

Claim: A Facebook post claims the image of a military truck convoy was headed for SouthEast Nigeria.,"On Monday June 7,2021, a Facebook user @Fola Adekeye shared the post of Akinde Oluwasogo which claimed military trucks in the image are heading to SouthEast Nigeria. Dubawa conducted multiple reverse image searches. Our Google reverse image search led to different Twitter posts.  The first post by Major General Ezeaka Chidozie Ishola Buharideen (@Ezeakachidozie) shared an image of this convoy claiming “A convoy of Nigerian Army logistics with a fleet of G12 Innoson guntrucks behind”. This post was made on May 15, 2020 and has 20likes and 6 retweets. The second result of the google search led to the Twitter post on May 15, 2020 by Sam Hart (@hartng) hailing the Nigerian Army for patronising Innoson vehicle with images of an Inosson truck and that of the Convoy in this claim. “Kudos to the Nigerian Army for patronising Innoson Vehicles. Note that the Nigerian Army orders the boots for its personnel from Aba.” Excerpt of Hart’s Twitter post caption. Another result showed a Twitter post on August 28, 2020 by Innoson Vehicles (@innosonvehicles) speaking about it’s partnership to produce vehicles for the military but none of the images attached looked like the convoy image. Our google search also led to a Facebook post by History, News AnD FaCt villagers which hailed the Nigerian Army for patronising Innoson vehicles. In this post the image contained two vehicles, on the left was a truck with Innoson clearly written on it while on the right was the same truck shared by Mr Adekeye. A Tineyey search did not yield any result. Our Yandex reverse image search brought up different results.  No match found  One of Yandex search results led to a May 14, 2020 post on China’s defense blog which described the struck as an IVM G12 utility vehicle  (Gun jeep) in a military logistics vehicle.  Another Yandex result led to a report by AutoJosh on May 15, 2020, noting these images were fighting vehicles produced by Innoson for the Nigerian Army. Going through the pictures we observed the trucks in the pictures were different from the convoy trucks alleged to be heading to the SouthEast. Dubawa also conducted an analysis of the image using the InVid tool and did not find any exif data or anything tangible to work with. Dubawa went ahead to research the IVM G12 military vehicle as one of the reverse image search revealed and found that the IVM G12 Military Vehicle is a variant of the 1/2 or 3/4 ton BJ2022 4×4 “Brave Warrior” Utility Vehicle manufactured by BAIC Motor under Beijing Auto Works (BAW). A look at pictures of the UVM G12 of Beijing and that of Innoson shows both trucks which are similar but look nothing like those alleged to be heading SouthEast. Screenshot of Beijing and Innoson IVM G12. Dubawa’s research and findings show there is not enough evidence to ascertain what vehicles these are in the image and the location of the image although we could ascertain the image is not new as it has been in circulation before 2021.

Claim: A Twitter user claims that the terms and conditions of the Crowwe application are the same with those of Spotify.,"Amid the recent announcement of Twitter ban by the Federal Government (FG) of Nigeria, former Nigerian presidential candidate, Adamu Garba, has named the  Crowwe application as the alternative to the microblogging website. In a statement on Friday, the federal government placed a ban on Twitter, saying the application undermines Nigeria’s corporate existence. This ban was greeted with outrage by Nigerians who felt the government had acted against the constitution which guaranteed freedom of expression. While some have devised other means of accessing Twitter, Adamu Garba, trended from Friday, the notion that the Crowwe application, could be an alternative. However, Twitter users have criticised the application on many grounds including its privacy policy. One other major criticism is the similarity of the terms and conditions with those of Spotify, a music streaming platform.  A Twitter user, Ego Beke (@rubylaren) wrote that the terms and conditions of the Crowwe App are the same with Spotify. “Check the Crowwe app’s terms and conditions. It’s the SAME thing as Spotify. They didn’t even bother editing. Like if you click on the hyperlink it redirects you to Spotify theft. What sort of pangolo app is that?” Excerpt of Ego Beke’s claim. Another Twitter user Bukola (@bukiola) made the same claim with a 15-second video showing how a click on the terms and condition of the App leads to spotify’s page. Also on Saturday June 6, 2021, a Twitter post by Tayo Dips (@tayo_dips) reported the Crowwe App to Spotify for copying it’s Terms and Conditions and also called for a lawsuit against Crowwe for plagiarism. “Hi @Spotify I’d like to report an intellectual property theft. The app @CrowweApp (Gloome Business Connections Ltd) made an authorised copy of your terms & conditions, WORD for WORD, uploading it on App Stores. I think you should file a lawsuit for infringing copyright.” Excerpt of the Twitter post To verify these claims, Dubawa downloaded the Crowwe App on Google PlayStore, to get details about its terms and conditions. After downloading, Dubawa was greeted with a landing page, which directed users to read and accept the App’s Privacy Policy and Terms and Services. It says: “Read our Privacy Policy. Tap Agree and Continue to accept the Terms of Services. Reading through the platform’s Terms of Services, Dubawa observed that a link to the terms and conditions listed, redirected users to the Spotify Terms and Conditions of Use.  This suggests that Crowwe’s Terms of Service were copied and edited from Spotify’s Terms and Conditions of Use. It appears the owners or developers of the Crowwe App must have forgotten to delete the Spotify hyperlink. Dubawa also observed that although they had been edited, many items on Crowwe’s Terms and Conditions such as its Limitation on Liability and Disclaimer of Warranties, bear similarities with items on Spotify’s Terms and Conditions of Use. Why Spotify, a Swedish music service launched in 2008, and the Crowwe app launched in 2020 are linked with so many similarities in their T and C, is a cause for concern, seeing their functions do not even align. A Terms and Conditions agreement, also known as a T&C, Terms of Use or Terms of Service, is the legal backbone of the relationship between a mobile app and its users. This lists clauses that highlight the rules, requirements, restrictions and limitations that a user must agree to in order to use the mobile App. A Terms and Conditions is not mandatory like the Privacy policy under any laws or required by any app stores. Terms and Conditions is beneficial to the business that owns the App and to the users. Here are some of these benefits for businesses: To enjoy the above benefits, specific clauses and the demand for users to agree to be bound by them should be made and clearly stated, so that it can be enforced where necessary. For the user, here are some of the benefits: T&Cs can be developed by the owner of the business, a lawyer or using that of others as models or templates but this must be customized to suit your business, product or service. There are also websites that help you generate templates like Tertempla’s terms and conditions generator, which makes it easy to create a Terms and Conditions agreement for your business.  Because T&C agreements are often complex, copying or borrowing another entity’s agreement is very tempting to save time and costs. Borrowing another’s T&C is common and generally legal, but doing so exposes your company to legal risks. One risk is that copying an agreement word-for-word is plagiarism and a violation of copyright law.  Although business terms and conditions may not be the most creative pieces, they still fall under the definition of literary works and as such are protected in law. Also, if you copy the T & C agreement of another business it is likely that differences in location, policies, and other areas can prevent their T&C from actually being effective. The claim that Crowwe’s Terms and Conditions were copied from Spotify is TRUE as findings reveal that the link in Crowwe’s Terms and Conditions redirects to Spotify’s Terms and Conditions of Use. Also, some items in the Crowwe’s Terms and Conditions bear similarities with items on Spotify’s Terms and Conditions of Use.

Claim: A Press Release in circulation claims Sierra Leone’s President Dr. Julius Maada Bio has ordered the immediate reduction of price for a bag of rice.,"A press release has been circulating on social media platforms, especially WhatsApp and Facebook in the morning hours of Friday June 4th 2021 that the president has ordered for the reduction in prices for a bag of rice.

His tweet reads: “Shot dead this morning by officers of the Nigerian  army at urata junction in Aba, Abia state. His crime? He is Igbo. No one would have known about these things if not for social media. That’s why they want to silence us. “They kill and then carry the body so that there will be no evidence.” These posts coincide with the issuance of a sit-at-home order by the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPoB) in the five states of the South-East zone. IPoB, led by Nnamdi Kanu, had issued the no-movement directive to mark what it termed the Biafra Day, a reference to May 30, 1967, the day the General Yakubu Gowon-led Federal Government declared a full-blown war with the then Eastern Regional Government headed by the late Emeka Odumegwu Ojukwu, for declaring the section of the country an independent nation to be known as the Republic of Biafra. A Google Reverse Image Search of the image showed that the said photograph was used in a 2018 report by Igberetvnews. The online news platform published the photograph while reporting the death of a 25-year-old tailor during a sit-at-home order in 2018 that turned bloody. The incident was tagged with the headline: BiafraHeroesDay: Soldiers Kill 25 Year Boy Playing Football in Aba (Photos). Moments later, the medium published an updated version of the event with the headline BiafraDay: Soldiers Caught on Camera Dragging Man on the Ground in Aba After Shooting Him Dead. The updated version had more photographs from the event.  Further checks by Dubawa revealed that the same photograph also appeared in a Nairaland post depicting the killing of the tailor on June 1, 2018. The claim in the tweet is misleading as the accompanying photograph is not recent. Although the image appears to have emanated from Aba in Abia State, evidence suggests that the photograph is from 2018.

Claim: A viral Twitter screenshot with the inscription of the “Twitter Public Policy” claims Twitter is apologetic for the recent action it took against President Buhari’s tweet.,"It’s no more news that the Nigerian government has banned Twitter operations in the country. While this decision taken by the government was not least expected, the action seems to have aroused diverse debates from members of the public. After the EndSARS protest in  the last quarter of 2020, the Nigerian government accused Twitter of arousing tension in the country–launching what appeared to be a subtle feud between Twitter and the Nigerian government.  The climax of the situation unfolded when twitter deleted  President Buhari’s recent Tweet in what they described as a bridge to their policy. However, days after Twitter’s action on the president, the Nigerian Government banned Twitter operations in  Nigeria in what many saw as Buhari’s response to Twitter’s action.  In response to the now popular topic in the Nigerian Public sphere, Twitter, shared on its ‘public policy’ handle its concerns over ‘open internet’ in Nigeria; apparently standing by its actions with no apologies directed to the Nigerian government.   The recent Tweet by ‘Twitter Public Policy’  Nonetheless, a viral screenshot of a tweet bearing the inscription of the ‘Twitter Public Policy’ handle, appeared online with a rather new narrative that seems to suggest Twitter’s desire to apologise and mend things with the Nigerian Government.   With no date stamps, the acclaimed tweet appeared June 5th, 2021 widely shared on WhatsApp and across different social media platforms.  Some users who came across the alleged tweet, expressed disbelief and stressed that Twitter ‘will not’ share such a tweet, while others felt it was Twitter’s way of making amends with the Nigerian Government. On Nairaland, a popular interactive site in Nigeria with over 3 million active users, the alleged tweet was shared alongside the narrative “Twitter bows to Nigerian Government”.  Whatever the case may be, confirming the originality and validity of such a tweet is vital, especially at a time when most Nigerians are trying to wrap their hands around the novel action taken by the government.  DUBAWA first launched a timeline search on all the recent posts made by the ‘Twitter Public Policy’ handle. The alleged tweet, circulating as a screenshot, was not found anywhere on the Twitter Public Policy handle. This finding,  however, led DUBAWA to uncover an online tool that allows users to create fake screenshots while posing as anyone they deem fit.  ‘The Tweet generator’ is a website based application that allows online users to create fake tweets. The application can be used to create a tweet template of choice, with a date of choice and all other things that a real tweet embodies. This same tool was also used to purport  a fake narrative referenced to Mark Zuckerberg, CEO Facebook. Fake Tweet created on ‘Tweet Generator’ posing as Mark Zuckerberg  Disclaimer: the above tweet is not real.  It was only created  for the purpose of illustration and clarity.  Evenmore, other red flags uncovered by DUBAWA from the acclaimed tweet shows that it is entirely fake. The above texts show the disparity between the acclaimed tweet (2) and an original tweet (1) taken. While the original tweet has ‘@’ before policy the fake tweet missed that part entirely.  Originally generated tweets always come with the ‘@’ symbol attached to the username.  While the original tweet has a hand-like symbol in front of the #Keepiton, this is not so with the fake one.  Dubawa also conducted image forensics of the fake tweet in comparison to the real one taken from ‘Twitter Public Policy’ page. We conducted an error level analysis on the two images,  checking the authenticity of opacity (0.95), error scale (94), JPEG Quality (94) on the same scale.  Image 1 Image 1: Results from forensics conducted on the original image. The outcome is a glittering ray of colors emerging from the text.  Image 2 Image 2: forensic results from the fake tweet. Aside from the 3 glittering parts of the image, the main text is entirely black and white.  The tweet under scrutiny is confirmed to be fake. It was not from Twitter nor was it ever tweeted. The manipulation of twitter screen shots is now a common phenomenon used to mislead unsuspecting members of the public. This claim is false.

"Claim: A tweet, which purportedly originated from the verified handle of Twitter, explains reasons for the deletion of President Muhammadu Buhari’s tweet.","Claim: A tweet, which purportedly originated from the verified handle of Twitter, explains reasons for the deletion of President Muhammadu Buhari’s tweet. Findings show that the picture being circulated was created using basic photo manipulation tools; it is false and had not come from @Twitter.  On June 1, 2021, Nigeria’s President, Muhammadu Buhari, received a briefing from the Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission, Mahmood Yakubu, at the Statehouse in Abuja. Yakubu had come to brief the president on a series of attacks on facilities of the electoral body across the country.  In reaction, President Buhari had said he will provide INEC with all it needs to carry out its duties and prepare ahead of the 2023 elections. In a Twitter thread after the briefing, the President, however, warned that ‘a rude shock’ awaits unpatriotic elements promoting insurrection and burning critical assets across the country. The president threatened to treat insurrectionists and those attacking facilities of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) like Nigerian soldiers treated the rebels during the civil war. Buhari, a retired general, fought during the war which claimed the lives of over one million persons. The last part of the thread attracted the outrage of many Nigerians who interpreted it to be a threat to a particular ethnic group. The tweet reads, “Many of those misbehaving today are too young to be aware of the destruction and loss of lives that occurred during the Nigerian Civil War. Those of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand.” Many Nigerians reported the Twitter account of the President seeking a ban on the account, however, Twitter deleted the controversial post by the President, rather than ban his account. A comment by Twitter stated, “This Tweet violated the Twitter Rules”. This action by the social media giant did not go down well with some government officials, especially the Minister of Information and Culture, who condemned Twitter’s action in a press conference. A photo, which had now gone viral on social media especially the popular messaging app, WhatsApp, featured Twitter’s verified handle explaining the rules President Buhari had contravened which caused the deletion of the tweet. The tweet which had purportedly come from Twitter read, “Dear @MBuhari We have no idea who you are or what country you are leading, we have come across a tweet that violates our rule number 4 of “safety and freedom” and removed it.” Dubawa started by checking the official handle of Twitter (@Twitter) to see if it posted any tweet such as this, but found nothing of such. From searches made, @Twitter’s last tweet was on May 28 while the circulating tweet was dated June 4, 2021. Also, the purported tweet was posted with Twitter for Android but checks from Dubawa have revealed that @Twitter uses Sprinklr or Twitter Web App to make posts. Also, Twitter had not independently made any comment on its verified handle regarding the deletion of the President’s tweet on its verified handle ever since the incident. Further checks by Dubawa showed that President Muhammadu Buhari is officially recognised as Nigeria’s President as stated on his bio in the verified handle. As of Sunday, the President’s account is active with 4.1 million followers. Dubawa further made use of Forensically, a tool for digital image forensics, which confirmed that the picture had been created by some photo manipulation tricks.  A screenshot of the quantized image of the photo which showed that the Twitter logo had been cropped into the image. Findings showed that the picture being circulated as a tweet from the verified handle of Twitter is false. The picture was manipulated.

"Claim: A viral WhatsApp message asks Nigerians to apply for a ₦200,000 business grant from the Federal Government, which will be paid into their bank accounts within 48 hours.","Mischievous elements have continued to prey on people’s desires for freebies by deceiving them that the federal government is distributing palliatives to citizens, providing endowments to youths, or giving grants to small scale business owners. A viral WhatsApp message early June, 2021 asks Nigerians “not to miss this ₦200,000 grant” the Federal Government is giving to citizens, it urges recipients to apply and assures them their bank accounts would be credited with the said amount “WITHIN 48 HOURS”. Screenshot of the WhatsApp message:  This is not the first time that Dubawa will be investigating false claims about the Federal Government, its institutions, or notable Nigerians giving grants to citizens. For example, there was a claim in November, 2020 that the federal government was giving out 3 million naira grants to support Nigerians, which Dubawa verified to be false. In February, 2021, Dubawa also proved that Dangote was not offering empowerment grants to members of the public while on June 1, 2021, Dubawa disproved the claims that Nigeria’s Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFund) was offering Nigerian students ₦20,000 grants. To assure citizens that this claim is genuine and deserves their attention, Dubawa clicked on the application link in the message. The bit.ly link changed to another website, which welcomes applicants, assuring them that they are just 30 seconds away from getting their “₦200,000 Africa Business grant disbursed!” We noted that the title of the grant has suddenly changed from “Federal Government grant” to “Africa Business grant” without stating which African country’s government and/or institution would be disbursing the money. There is also an icon that applicants can also click to check the status of their applications. Applicants are expected to key in their first name, surname, gender, email address, mobile telephone number, and country of origin. This writer notes that even though the title of the fund was initially Nigerian and then later changed to African, a list of almost all countries of the world popped up when this writer tried to key in her country of origin. Applicants are also expected to select ‘Fund Type’ and there is a ‘Grant’ option as well as a ‘Loan’ option, even though the call was for a grant. Image of the welcome page on the site: This writer filled in fake bio-details to be able to proceed and when she clicked submit, a new page which required her to enter her bank account number, bank name and account name came up. Again, she proceeded to fill in fake details in order to proceed. She finally submitted the application.  Image of application page requesting bank details: Thereafter, a congratulatory message appeared, informing her that her application had been received and she had been assigned a ‘GRANT MANAGER’ who would manage her request. She was encouraged to inform friends about the opportunity. Image of the congratulatory page: When she tried to click on the ‘SHOW MY GRANT MANAGER’ link without sharing the link to friends and WhatsApp groups, a message popped up informing her that she had not shared the message and that she needed to share it to a “Minimum 15 group or 15 friends” before completing the application. Image urging applicants to share link: Dubawa further investigated the website making the ‘₦200,000 Federal Government’ claim using Domainbigdata and discovered that the website was just recently registered on May 25, 2021 for an initial period of one year and the site expires on May 25, 2022. Information about updateinnigeria.com from Domainbigdata: Dnslytics, a tool used in accessing details of websites, showed that updateinnigeria.com is not listed in the top million list of Alexa nor in the DMOZ directory. Information about updateinnigeria.com from Dnslytics: Whois.com, a tool for domain name search, also notes that the website is hosted on ns1.contabo.net, ns2.contabo.net and ns3.contabo.net servers in Nigeria and the email address of the registrant is [email protected] Information about updateinnigeria from Whois.com: Dubawa also searched Nigeria’s federal government social media handles and did not see any information about a ₦200,000 grant for businesses. The claim by updateinnigeria.com that the federal government is giving out ₦200,000 grant to businesses is false.

"Claim: Former Nigerian Minister of Aviation, Femi Fani-Kayode, claims there was an Arabic inscription on the Nigerian currency in the pre-colonial era.","Nigeria’s diversity, with its multiple ethnicities, religions, and languages, constitutes the country’s rich culture. Sometimes, these different groups are at loggerheads.  Over the years, the Nigerian state has been embroiled in rivalries and inter–ethnic struggles for political influence and dominance, most of which are spurred by disinformation and misinformation from notable and influential personalities, including celebrities, religious leaders, and politicians. On Saturday May 29, 2021, Femi Fani-Kayode, a former Nigerian Minister of Aviation, wrote via his official Twitter handle (@realFFK): “It is interesting to note that there was an Arabic inscription on Nigerian currency even in the pre-colonial era. How do you explain this and what does it tell you???” He attached to the post, a photo of a One Nigerian Pound currency note, once used by the country. Exposed to his over 1 million followers, the post had generated numerous engagements – 294 comments, 457 retweets and 957 likes, within six hours. The post, believed and supported by many of his followers, formed the basis of their comments. For instance, Mahmud Zakariya (@MahmudZakariya4) wrote: “It shows that northern Nigeria Flag of Nigeria is a force to be reckoned with in the country’s politics. No region is as important as the north.” Another user, @Favbreed1 commented: “That Nigeria’s colonial masters (Britain) allowed it in a secular nation, is what has emboldened the Fulani…to think Nigeria and its people belong to them and it’s ok to displace them and take over their ancestral lands.” Prince Stephen Blossom (@GraciousTongue) wrote: “It tells me that the acclaimed polished & educated Southern leaders were never smart at all. It tells me the reason minor tribes like the Fulani were able to systematically grab Nigeria to themselves. They set an agenda very early, & they planned towards achieving it. That’s it!” Supporting the post, @topsy_adeusi also commented: The crisis you see today was 85% created by the British. The North was poor the south had wealth. The British through the sultan in Sokoto decided to enslave the remaining parts of the regions. So, it is not surprising to see those inscriptions. (Saynotobritain).” Mr. Fani-Kayode, popularly known as FFK, is known to have in recent times, made bogus statements, capitalizing on his large social media followership to spur the spread of disinformation and misinformation. Examples can be found here and here. To verify the claims by Mr. Fani-Kayode, Dubawa delved  into Nigeria’s history. Findings reveal that, contrary to the former minister’s claim, there was no Nigerian currency in the pre-colonial era. The Nigerian pre-colonial era refers to the period before the advent of colonial rule in 1914, when the Northern and Southern protectorates were united into a single British colony for administrative purposes. The amalgamation marked the creation of Nigeria. Tracing the history of currency in Nigeria, the Central Bank of Nigeria notes that “during the pre-colonial era, different cultures used a variety of items as means of exchange. These included cowries, manilas, beads, bottles and salt amongst others.” This finding reveals that cowries, manilas, beads and other traditional currencies competently served the functions of money in the pre-colonial era, thus, discrediting Mr. Fani-Kayode’s claim which suggests the existence of a Nigerian currency in the pre-colonial era. “It is interesting to note that there was an Arabic inscription on Nigerian currency even in the pre-colonial era. How do you explain this and what does it tell you???” Mr. Fani-Kayode attached to his post, the photo of a One Pound note, which he claimed to be a Nigerian currency used in the pre-colonial era. Dubawa assessed the currency and observed that it is dated 15th September 1958, which is clearly during the colonial era. As such, there is no possibility that it was in use in the pre-colonial era, as claimed by Mr. Fani-Kayode. Contrary to the claim by the former Minister of Aviation, the inscription on the currency is Hausa Ajami and NOT Arabic, veteran journalist Mannir Dan-Ali revealed in a BBC article. “It is Ajami Hausa, not Arabic, that is on the naira notes,” he wrote. “The Ajami writing on each naira note is for the benefit of the tens of millions of Hausa speakers, who can only read and write in that script, which is taught in schools across the North.” Mr. Dan-Ali, a former editor-in-chief of the Daily Trust newspaper, explained that Ajami was the first means of literacy on the African continent, centuries before the arrival of Western colonizers and Christian missionaries with the Roman alphabet.  Ajami is used across Africa, including for Swahili in East Africa, Nigerian languages like Kanuri, Nupe, Yoruba, Fulfulde and Hausa, and Tamashek, the language of the Tuaregs in North and West Africa. Musa Muhammad, an archivist notes that the inscription on the naira is a transliteration of Hausa into Arabic. “The letters on the currency are as secular in origin as the Roman alphabet used in modern Bibles. Any non-Arab language written in Arabic script we call Ajami,” he says. A professor of communications at the University of Maiduguri, Abubakar Mu’azu, said the sign on the naira represents the value of the denominations of the naira in Hausa. “The Arabic letters used to write in Hausa are called Ajami. An Arab may read it but may not get the meaning unless he/she understands Hausa,” he told Dubawa. The Ajami inscription on the currency note shared by Mr. Fani-Kayode says “Pam Daya” in Hausa, which means “One Pound”. Claims by a former Minister of Aviation, Femi Fani-Kayode, that there was an Arabic inscription on Nigerian currency even in the pre-colonial era, is FALSE. During the pre-colonial era, there was no Nigerian currency. At the time, different cultures used a variety of items such as cowries, manilas, beads, bottles and salt, as means of exchange. Moreso, Nigeria did not exist during the pre-colonial era. The country came into being as a result of colonial rule. In 1914, the British colonial government created Nigeria, with the amalgamation of the Northern and Southern protectorates. Findings have also shown that the inscription on the currency note is in Ajami Hausa and not Arabic, as Mr. Fani-Kayode has claimed.

Claim: A viral WhatsApp message states that all those who took the COVID-19 vaccine will die in two years.,"Purveyors of fear and conspiracy theories about the imaginary dangers of COVID-19 vaccines have refused to back down even as governments and health-focused civil society organisations strive to ensure that many individuals take the COVID-19 vaccine for their protection. Recently, a viral WhatsApp message claims that everyone who takes the COVID-19 vaccine will die in two years. The statement attributed to an epidemiologist, Professor Montagnier, claims “there is no hope, and no possible treatment for those who have been vaccinated already.” The message also claims that all individuals who have taken the COVID-19 vaccine will “all die from antibody dependent enhancement.” A link to Dr. Montagnier’s Wiki page was also shared in the viral message.  Dubawa clicked on the website link in the WhatsApp message and was redirected to a news story on LifeSiteNews. The website claims it is a non-profit Internet service “dedicated to issues of culture, life, and family.” It reports on developments in the United States, Canada, and around the world and was originally a publication by Campaign Life Coalition (CLC), a Canadian national pro-life organisation. The news was published by LifeSiteNews on Wednesday, May 19, 2021. It was reported that Dr. Montagnier made this claim in a French interview which was translated and published by RAiR Foundation, USA on May 18, 2021. This claim has gone viral across the world and it was still received from a Nigerian contact by this writer on May 30, 2021. It has also been shared on numerous WhatsApp groups in Nigeria. Dr. Luc Montagnier is a French virologist and Nobel Prize Winner in Medicine, who was recognized (along with two others) for his contribution to the discovery of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in 2008. However, he has been in the news for promoting several controversial claims about vaccinations, homeopathy, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Dr. Montagnier has become so controversial that in 2017, over a hundred academic scientists condemned his promotion of controversial claims in an open letter. Dr. Montagnier has claimed in an interview with “Pourquoi Doctor” then on the CNews site in 2020 that coronavirus was man made (in a laboratory) and that it contains genetic material from HIV. The interview has now been deleted. He has also claimed that the administered COVID-19 vaccines are what is creating the different variants of the disease. In the past, he has claimed that water has memory, a good immune system could prevent people from contracting HIV and was against the French Government’s move to make some vaccines compulsory. While Dr. Luc Montagnier is clearly against COVID-19 vaccines, a translated two and half minutes video of his interview on Rumble as well as a translation of the full interview on Planet360 did not contain any specific information about people dying in two years. Dr. Montagnier, however, condemned COVID-19 vaccines in the interview, claiming that the vaccines are responsible for the increasing variants of the COVID-19 virus. The World Health Organisation has confirmed the safety of the COVID-19 vaccines as well as several recognised scientists and institutions the world over, such as the John Hopkins Medicine Centre in the United States, Britain’s National Health Service (NHS), and Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). The World Health Organisation has also condemned Dr. Montagnier’s claim that the vaccines are causing new variants of COVID-19, stating that there is no evidence that this is true. Several national and international fact-checking organisations like India Today, Politifact, APnews, Deccan Herald have also fact-checked this claim with the verdict that Dr. Montagnier did not say that individuals who take the COVID-19 vaccine would die in two years. LifeSiteNews has also added a corrigendum to the story on May 27, 2021, stating that they did not publish any comment saying Montagnier claims individuals who are vaccinated would die in two years and that this version of his interview emanated only on social media. LifeSiteNews claims it only reported what Dr. Montagnier said in the interview about vaccines (being a medical and scientific error), and that several scientists have rejected his claims. Dr. Luc Montagnier is controversial and has authored a few hoaxes about COVID-19. He is also against the COVID-19 vaccine, but he did not say that all those who take the COVID-19 vaccine would die two years after taking the vaccine.

Claim: A viral video claims Governor Uzodinma’s convoy was attacked by unknown gunmen.,"The preponderance of insecurity in Nigeria is no more a shrouded topic. While its prevalence is almost in all parts of the country, the southeastern states seem to have taken the center stage these recent days. From the latest killing of the Presidential aide, Ahmed Gulak to the multiple attacks carried out by unknown gunmen in the region mostly targeting police stations will easily attract the attention of the public. A good example is with the viral video making  rounds on social media and other blogs, which alleged that the convoy to the Governor of Imo State, Senator Uzodinma, was attacked by unknown gunmen.  The claim put out a video that depicts a surging pandemonium, as cars  and people in the scene sped to safety from the approaching gunshots and multiple tear gas firings. This scene was said to be that of Uzodinma who narrowly escaped the acclaimed attempted attack on his convoy.  Though not entirely surprising, especially with the vivid pictures the video depicted, the claim was widely shared on WhatsApp accompanied as icing on the cake.  Such unconfirmed claims wield the potential to reinforce people’s fear and even push unsuspecting members of the society into taking irrational decisions, thus warranting. DUBAWA’s immediate verification of the claim.   First, DUBAWA took key frames from the acclaimed video and ran a Yandex reverse image search. Results from the query traced the earliest version of the video clip on YouTube, shared on January 18th, 2020 with the description “How leaders were teargassed in Mumias today.” Mumias is a town in Kakamega County of Kenya. The town has an urban population of 116,358. Mumias was the centre of the Mumias District where a road links the town to Kakamega, Busia, Bungoma, Butere.  The same video was also uploaded by one Othaya GlobalNews on YouTube to explain how some political leaders were tear-gassed in Mumias. So also on KTN News, one of Kenya’s largest newspapers and the oldest newspaper in the country,  where the same video was posted on its YouTube channel in a report that lasted for three minutes and forty seconds.  Nonetheless, this is not the first time this same video is married alongside a false narrative to mislead unsuspecting members of the society.   A Twitter user, once falsely used the same video to falsely depict how in September 2020  Zulum’s convoy,  the Governor of Borno State, was attacked by Boko Haram while returning to Maiduguri from Baga.   Though DUBAWA’s efforts to contact the Governor proved unsuccessful, a report by TVC shares that “Imo State government says the convoy of the State Governor, Senator Hope Uzodinma, has not come under attack from anybody. The State Government in a statement from his media office described the reported attack as an example of fake news.  It said the video making the rounds on social media is not that of the governor and the video does not state where the alleged attack took place.”  The claim that Governor Hope Uzodinma’s convoy was attacked by unknown gunmen is false. The video used to paint the false narrative was taken out of its original context. The actual  incident took place in Kenya last year and not in Nigeria. Hence, this claim is false.

CLAIM: A viral video showing bodies of dead soldiers has been passed round as Nigerian soldiers killed by Boko Haram insurgents in a recent attack.,"CLAIM: A viral video showing bodies of dead soldiers has been passed round as Nigerian soldiers killed by Boko Haram insurgents in a recent attack. Viral video that purports to show bodies of Nigerian soldiers killed by Boko Haram insurgents after an attack is FAKE. The soldiers in the video are not Nigerian soldiers. Nigeria’s struggle against insurgency remains one of the major conflicts in the sub-region. Despite efforts by the military to contain the insurgents, attacks have continued, leading to the displacement of millions and the death of over 30,000 people in northern Nigeria, including security forces. A recent resurgence in the activities of Boko Haram and other Islamist terrorist groups has seen increased attacks targeted at Nigerian security forces. About 30 soldiers were killed in April in four attacks by Islamist militants in northeast Nigeria, a report said. In the same month, the terrorists hit and overran a police station in Damasak, Borno. state. A video which has been forwarded many times on WhatsApp, as indicated by the messaging App, shows the lifeless bodies of soldiers mutilated by bullets. It was shared with the message “boko haram killing Nigerian soldiers,” suggesting the video to be a video of Nigerian soldiers killed by Boko Haram insurgents in a recent attack. In the 4:29 minute clip, the insurgents are seen walking around chanting “Allahu Akbar”, as they carted away rifles, bulletproof vests, and ammunition, previously belonging to the dead soldiers. The quality of the video is poor and blurry, suggesting degradation from repeated sharing across different platforms. Dubawa also found the same video, albeit a shorter version, shared on Twitter by one Anderson Micar with the caption: “Boko Haram kill Nigeria Soldiers like chicken. I wonder what type of arms Nigeria military is using to fight them. Maybe stones and sticks.” DUBAWA analyzed the video on VLC, a media player, using the sigma filter tool to sharpen the video since it was blurry and of poor quality, as well as the slow-speed tool, which aided in capturing the images in the video. With the use of both tools, which improved the quality and visibility of the images in the video, DUBAWA observed that the license plates of some of the military trucks in the video bore the national colours of Mali – green, yellow and red. This suggests that the trucks and of course, the dead soldiers, are of the Malian Army. The license plates of two  trucks spotted in the viral video reads: 010680 AMA and 010676 AMA. DUBAWA conducted a Yandex reverse image search using a snapshot of one of the trucks in the video, and found Malian Army trucks bearing deep similarities (license plate, camouflage colour scheme) with the ones in the video, including some from the events of the 2020 Malian Army coup. A keyword search also confirmed that the trucks in the video are indeed of the Malian Army [FAMA – Forces Armées Maliennes]. DUBAWA discovered that Nigerian soldiers, as well as the Nigerian Army trucks use a unique camouflage scheme which differentiates it from the Malian Army and other Armies in Africa. This fact-checker also found that the group that attacked and killed the soldiers in the video could not have been Boko Haram insurgents, as they do not operate in Mali. The attackers in the video are most likely members of Jama’at Nusrat al Islam wal Muslimeen (JNIM), Islamic State Greater Sahara (ISGS) or any other terrorist groups active in the francophone country. A viral video purporting to show “boko haram killing Nigerian soldiers” is FALSE. The soldiers in the video are not Nigerian soldiers and the incident did not happen in Nigeria.

"Claim: Multiple sources claim that the wife of Nigerian Army chief, Lt-General Ibrahim Attahiru, died in the plane crash with her husband.","Claim: Multiple sources claim that the wife of Nigerian Army chief, Lt-General Ibrahim Attahiru, died in the plane crash with her husband. FALSE. Wife of Nigeria’s Army Chief, Fati Attahiru, did not die with her husband in the ill-fated air crash, as she was not a passenger on the plane. On Friday 21st May 2021, news broke that a military airplane had crashed in Kaduna state, Nigeria, killing the Chief of Army Staff, his wife, other officers and members of the crew. Reports said the crash left no survivors. The news was widely shared on social media including Twitter and Facebook, as well as reported by blogs and news websites, including this one owned by Reuben Abati, a former presidential spokesperson. One of such claims was made in a post by a twitter user, Adetutu Balogun, MBA.  The user also shared an update, affirming the claim. It reads: “Updated: Chief of Army Staff, Lieutenant General Attahiru, has died in a plane crash in Kaduna reportedly with his wife, a Major General, his Aide camp, and personal aides. He was on an official trip to Kaduna to attend an official assignment that was to hold on Saturday morning.” This post was retweeted 87 times, with 8 quoted tweets and 203 likes, while a Facebook post with the same claim generated 345 likes, 135 comments and had been shared 22 times within 11 hours. In our quest to verify the claims, Dubawa checked official information channels of the Nigerian Army and came across a statement on the incident by the Army Spokesperson, Mohammed Yerima. “The Nigerian Army regrets to announce the passing away of its Chief of Army Staff, Lieutenant General Ibrahim Attahiru. The sad event occurred following an air crash in Kaduna which also claimed the lives of 10 other officers including the crew,” said Mohammed Yerima, a Brigadier General.  Yerima noted that the Army chief was on a trip to Kaduna from Abuja, when the unfortunate incident occurred. The statement made no mention of the wife of the COAS, Fati Attahiru. Findings also show that Mrs. Attahiru was not aboard the ill-fated plane, as seen on the list of passengers released by presidential aide, Bashir Ahmad. The list showed that Gen. Attahiru, died in company of ten other passengers, including his aides, three Brigadier Generals and the flight crew. The claim that Fati Attahiru, wife of the Chief of Army Staff died in the air crash that claimed the lives of her husband, Lt. Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru and other military officers is FALSE. Mrs. Attahiru was not a passenger on the ill-fated plane, as findings have shown. ",plane,23/05/2021,https://dubawa.org/wife-of-army-chief-attahiru-did-not-die-in-air-crash-as-falsely-claimed/
Claim: A viral WhatsApp message claims new WhatsApp setting now allows anyone to add you to a group,"WhatsApp group is a platform to which one can invite more than one person (family members, friends, colleagues etc) to chat with. While anyone can create a WhatsApp group, there is a user limit of 256 participants.  When created, you can add participants in the group or send an invitation link to individuals you want to join the group. Recently, a viral WhatsApp message claims a new WhatsApp setting allows anyone including terrorist groups to add you to their group without you knowing. This message goes ahead to direct users on how they can change this setting to secure their account. “WHATSAPP HAS CHANGED THE GROUP SETTING TO INCLUDE  “EVERYONE”. So with EVERYONE, people you don’t know, including Boko Haram, ISWAP, Al Qaeda, can add you to their group without you knowing.” Excerpt of Viral WhatsApp message. Dubawa visited the WhatsApp blog and found a similar direction on how to change the group privacy setting.  However, WhatsApp noted these changes to group privacy settings can’t be made on WhatsApp Web or Desktop, but once done on your phone,  it will be synced with WhatsApp Web and Desktop. A keyword search also led to reports as far back as 2019 guiding users how to work around this group setting. A report by Gadgets 360 published in 2019 gave steps for changing this setting on Android phones and iPhones. Another report by Gadgets Now published in 2020 gave 6 steps to stop people from adding others to WhatsApp groups. Dubawa’s Search also found that this feature is not new as it was launched in April 2019 and updated in November 2019 by WhatsApp. Before this update, the choice of who can add another person to a WhatsApp group was between “Everyone” (known and unknown persons can add you) and “Nobody” (no one can add you to any group). This new update however gives you three options: “Everyone”, ” My Contacts” (that is only those you have their numbers saved can add you to groups) and “My Contacts Except” (this gives you the liberty to choose who among your contact should not be allowed to add you to a group).  While it is true this WhatsApp feature to control who can add you to a WhatsApp group exists, it is not new as it has been in existence since 2019. This makes the claim in the viral Whatsapp message misleading. ",2019,18/05/2021,https://dubawa.org/whatsapp-group-privacy-setting-in-existence-since-2019-not-new-as-claimed-in-recent-message/
"Claim: A twitter user shared photos of unmarked helicopters allegedly seen by villagers, flying over and airdropping packages in forests in Maiduguri.","Claim: A twitter user shared photos of unmarked helicopters allegedly seen by villagers, flying over and airdropping packages in forests in Maiduguri. Photos of unmarked helicopters allegedly flying over and dropping packages in Maiduguri forests are FAKE. The photos were lifted from incidents in the United States of America. Insecurity in Nigeria has continued to be heightened by activities of insurgents across the country, especially in the North-East region. There have been allegations of foreign interest and sponsorship of Boko Haram and other insurgent groups responsible for attacks in the region. On Tuesday 11th May 2021, a twitter user Defense News Nigeria shared a thread alleging the French government of sponsoring African militant and rebel groups. It also linked France to the recent upsurge of the Boko Haram insurgency in Nigeria. A thread on Twitter is a series of connected Tweets from one user. In the opening tweet, Defense News Nigeria shared three photos of unmarked helicopters purportedly flying over forests in Maiduguri and dropping packages. The tweet reads: “Residents in several villages talk about unmarked helicopters flying over forests in Maiduguri air dropping packages. Especially at night. In one incident they watched the helicopter crashes. Villagers ran to the scene to rescue the occupants and were stunned to see two Caucasian men burning briefcases of hundred dollar bills before running away from the crash site.” The post, which claimed the incident happened in 2015, generated 3,743 retweets, 411 quote tweets and 4,471 likes. Dubawa analyzed the photos and a reverse image search showed that the photos of the helicopters were lifted from old publications on incidents in the United States of America. The first photo was traced to an incident in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It is of a low-flying helicopter which drew curious looks from residents in Philadelphia’s Mt. Airy neighborhood in early June 2017. Findings later revealed it was a Philadelphia Energy Company helicopter on patrol of transmission lines. The photo of the second helicopter in the tweet is a snapshot from a video in Medina County, Ohio. The video was made by landowners who heard gunshots coming from a helicopter flying over their property on April 15, 2016. Shooters in the helicopter were hunting feral hogs in the area. Dubawa also found that the last photo in the tweet is of “an FBI helicopter above the Charleston area on Wednesday, May 22, 2019”, according to this publication. It explained that the incident was part of an FBI joint training with local police in Charleston County, South Carolina. The post about unmarked helicopters flying over forests in Maiduguri and airdropping packages, used photos from Pennsylvania, Ohio and South Carolina in the US.

Claim: A news blog @lindaikejiblogofficial claims Indian COVID-19 variant is now in Nigeria,"Viruses mutate all the time, producing different versions or variants of themselves. While most of these mutations are insignificant, others can be more contagious and harder to vaccinate against. The virus that causes COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) is a type of coronavirus, a large family of viruses named for the crown-like spikes on their surfaces. A United State (US) government inter-agency group developed a Variant Classification scheme that  classifies COVID-19 into three: variants of interest, variants of concern, and variants of high consequence. Recently a news blog @Lindaikejiblogoffical claims that a new variant from India is now in Nigeria and has been found in Edo and Osun states in Nigeria. This blog quoted Professor Oyewale Tomori as saying this at an interview with Leadership newspaper. Screenshots of this post have been making the rounds on  WhatsApp and was sent in for verification by one of our subscribers prompting Dubawa to look into the claim. Dubawa conducted a keyword search on the Indian variant and its spread, and to find  accredited reports on such variants. Yes, there is a variant known as B.1.617 which was first detected in India in October 2020. This variant, which has been classified as one of global concern, has spread to 49 countries. So far, seven African nations including Nigeria have now officially detected the variant within their territories. Our keyword search also led to the report accredited by the news blog. The report by Leadership which was published on Wednesday, May 12, 2021, according to Tomori, revealed the Indian COVID-19 variant has entered Nigeria. Professor Tomori said Nigeria has recorded five cases of the Indian COVID-19 variant in Osun and Edo states. Oyewale is the immediate past President of the Nigerian Academy of Science with experience in virology, disease prevention and control. Between 1994 to 2004, he worked with the World Health Organization’s Africa Region, from where he participated in establishing the African Regional Polio Laboratory Network. He moved on to become the Vice Chancellor of the Redeemer’s University in Nigeria from 2004 to 2011. Dubawa’s search also led to other reports confirming the variant’s existence in Nigeria. A report by Pulse Nigeria quoted Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) as confirming that the variant has been in Nigeria for three weeks already. Another report by Punch noted that the African Centre of Excellence for Genomics of Infectious Disease (ACEGID) in the Redeemers University Ede, Osun State alerted the NCDC of Indian’s new variant three weeks ago. Also, a Twitter post by the centre revealed the existence of the variant, noting it will provide an update on the virus during its Director-General, Chike Ihekweazu’s, appearance on Arise TV. Dubawa found the Arise TV morning show on Youtube with the NCDC speaking on the Indian variant in Nigeria. The DG confirmed the centre was informed by the Research Institute, ACEGID, which is one of its partners in the research about the Indian variant three weeks ago. In this video, he added that the country has everything under control, noting the travel ban on India, Turkey, and Brazil two weeks ago was a product of its advice to the government after conducting a risk assessment.  Yes, the Indian variant, B.1.617, was found in Nigeria three weeks ago and the NCDC has confirmed that it has everything under control. As new variants continue to emerge, scientists are working on learning about their characteristics (how easily they spread, whether they could cause more severe illness, and whether existing approved vaccines will protect people against them). Nevertheless, it is recommended to continue observing COVID-19 preventive measures. ",states,15/05/2021,https://dubawa.org/yes-indian-covid-19-variant-now-in-nigeria/
"Claim: A news report by Newsclickng claims David Oyedepo, a christian cleric,  has warned his members against taking the COVID-19 vaccine as it is deadly and has not been tested.","With over three million deaths across nearly 200 countries of the world, including Africa where as of May 9, 2021, there have been 124,715 deaths amid efforts to vaccinate. Nigeria is not left out of vaccination efforts as it began vaccination of its citizens in March. In view of this, a recent news report by Newsclickng claims the General Overseer (GO) of the Living Faith Church International popularly known as Winners Chapel, Bishop David Oyedepo, urged his church members to reject COVID-19 vaccination. According to this report, this comment was made on Sunday during the 40th-anniversary thanksgiving service of the church in the Ota Cathedral in Ogun State. “Let me warn you against this deadly thing circulating around the country because it has not been duly tested. An elder of this church, who works with the World Health Organisation, confirmed this, thanking me for always speaking the truth about the authenticity of the COVID-19 vaccinee.” A report by The Nation noted that David Oyedepo said the vaccine is deadly and untested. The report also added that the pastor made his claim based on a confirmation of an elder of this church, who works with the World Health Organisation (WHO). We first found a short video clip of about 6minutess 20seconds of Mr Oyedepo speaking against the vaccine. Dubawa also found the full live stream (9hours 51minutes) of the Church’s 40th-anniversary thanksgiving service on Living Faith Church Global’s Youtube page which has 368,000 subscribers. Here we found this comment was actually made by the televangelist from about  5hours, 59minutes and 30seconds to about 6hours, 5mins and 22 seconds into the live stream of the service. This video which was streamed 21hours ago (that is on Sunday, May 9, 2021) had generated 144,000 views as of Monday, May 10, 2021. While speaking to his new book titled “Jesus still heals all terminal diseases including coronavirus,” he warned against the vaccine noting it has not been tested. “let me again warn you against the vaccine that they carry around. I am not a medical doctor but I read, it has not been tested, sir. I ran into one of our elders who worked for the WHO for 12 years and he said thank you sir for exposing this thing. They wanted Africa dead, I heard them say it. When we were not dying, they now said how can we kill them faster? Africa has the least casualties of coronavirus among all the continents of the world. They should come and find out from us how to deal with coronavirus at no cost. If I bless your bottle of oil, no matter who you are in the world, and you are a child of God and you take a shot of it, tell me where they will find coronavirus. That is my area, that is my calling. Be careful of that deadly thing called a vaccine, be careful.” Reacting to what he described as a governor’s comment on terminating workers who refuse vaccination, he said “There is no law under heaven that enforces medication on anybody. If anyone terminated you for not taking the vaccine, my God will show up. Don’t listen to any harassment. I have never seen a place like this just carry an ignorant thing on our head. One governor just changed it quickly that if you are interested take it. That was not what he said before. Get this book and live free from every fear of the devil”. First, in Oyedepo’s statement, the said elder who allegedly works with the WHO was not named. Also, the claim that COVID-19 vaccines are targeted at reducing Africa’s population has been debunked by Dubawa and it is noteworthy that vaccines are being rolled out not only in Africa but all over the world.  The claim that the vaccine is not tested is false, as available documents by vaccine producers like Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca (which is currently being administered in Nigeria), the Johnson and Johnson vaccine “COVID-19 vaccines save lives. They also protect people against severe illness from the virus and are a key tool in helping to end the pandemic. We are not aware of the unnamed WHO staff member allegedly quoted in this piece. All COVID-19 vaccines with WHO Emergency Use Listing are deemed to be safe and effective.” “Along with COVID-19 vaccines, mask-wearing, regular hand-cleaning and safe social distancing, particularly at larger gatherings, will also save lives and protect people from the virus.” The claim by the General Overseer of the Living Faith Church, David Oyedepo, that the  COVID-19 vaccine is deadly and has not been tested is false and misleading. Our findings and comments from the World Health Organization confirm this.  ",misleading,11/05/2021,https://dubawa.org/covid-19-vaccines-tested-safe-not-deadly-as-preached-by-bishop-oyedepo/
"Claim:  A user on Twitter claims that ‘over 50 cows belonging to Fulani herdsmen were poisoned to death by Amotekun and or Yoruba youths in Akoko Local Government Area, of Ondo state.","The ongoing crisis between Fulani herdsmen and farmers mostly in the south is no new story. Now, in reference to this existing reality, a Twitter user, Sarki (@Waspapping_) claims  that ‘over 50 cows that belonged to Fulani herdsmen were poisoned to death by Amototekun/Yoruba youths in Akoko LGA, Ondo State. The user implied that the matter is not voiced on any media.  Alongside a photo displaying the acclaimed dead cows is also the narrative: “I just woke up to the news that Over 50 cows that belong to “Fulani herdsman”  were poisoned to deaths on Monday in Akoko LGA, Ondo state, by Amotekun/Yoruba youths, no any outcry from anyone or media outrage. No hashtags, nothing. It’s well.” Nonetheless, the tweet attracted over 1,100 like, close to 600 retweets and over 300 diverse comments that cut across suspicion and conviction.  The acclaimed Amotekun displayed by the claimant is a security outfit based in southwestern Nigeria that was established in 2020 by the southwestern governors to respond to the security challenges in the region.  Hence, this claim will not only trigger controversy but even chaos If it is not carefully scrutinized.  DUBAWA conducted a Yandex reverse image search and results show that the acclaimed picture of dead cows in question was from major news in 2019 about a mysterious thunder that struck on Oke Owa, Ijare community in Ifedore Local Government Area of Ondo State, killing at least 36 cows.  The news was popular around the time it occurred 3 years ago and had attracted multiple reports from different media. Apparently, the claimant only dated the picture a bogus narrative to it.  The picture provided by the claimant as evidence was dated and picked out of its original context to paint a rather bogus and false report.

Claim: A viral video making rounds on social media claims that Boko Haram is forcefully converting commuters in Niger State in Nigeria into islam,"One topical security issue that has dominated news over the past weeks is the  announced  presence of  Boko Haram in a number of communities in  Niger State. This has aroused concern amongst many Nigerians exposed to a a video making  rounds on Twitter, WhatsApp and other social media platforms alleging that the communities held by Boko Haram   in Niger State are now being forced to convert to Islam by the terror group, Boko Haram. The claim was shared multiple times on WhatsApp, apparently arousing people’s outrage over the said situation.  The sensitivity of security issues in Nigeria is like a ticking bomb that requires quick and prudent attention. It is as a result of this reality that DUBAWA opted to uncover the  verity of this claim.  While the governor of Niger State has already debunked the claim, stating that it was fake news, the details of clarification neither stated where the conversion ceremony took place.  However, DUBAWA uncovered that the purported video was taken out of its original context to paint a  misleading story.  It was originally shared on Tik Tok by a user (@brahimakone49)  as part of a collection  of videos that were posted to depict an apparent Islamic  crusade that commenced on 29th of April 2021 in the town of Kolia, Ivory Coast.  The user, @brahimakone49 who originally shared the video on Tik tok took time to respond to other users who needed clarification on the actual event the video depicted. He confirmed that it took place in Kolia, Ivory coast and stated clearly that it was a crusade held by a certain female Muslim cleric who was performing healing sessions on the crowdin the video.  In clip 9 of the video collection, when a commenter (@banfana banfana) asked what was actually happening in the scene, the actual source replied that all the people present came to be treated in Kolia by the woman who works miracles.  Also in clip 9, when asked by another user (@Toure Deed)  where it took place, the publisher clearly stated that it took place in Kolia, Ivory coast.  Throughout the comment box, the actual author of the video collection repeatedly mentioned that it took place in Kolia, Ivory coast and explained generally that the event was a healing session held by a certain female Islamic cleric who is seen speaking in subsequent clips of the video. DUBAWA uncovered that the  acclaimed video making rounds on social media was merely the 10th out of a series of 11 videos shared by the original source.  The username of the original source is highlighted green above in one of the purported claims making rounds. The same username could be traced in image 1. While the writing ‘partie 10’ outlined in blue, shows the sequence number of the video amongst total 11 of the collection originally shared, as it can be seen in image 3 below.  These are the rest of the collection the purported video was selected from to paint a new and misleading narrative. All highlighted yellow in the center of each clip. Nonetheless, to have a further grasp of the context, content and reality of the actual video shared on Tik tok the link to all the clips are presented below: Additionally, seven other clips shared by the same author giving the actual event an even more glaring context are shared here:  Also notable was the Baoulé dialect and a little bit of French spoken throughout the duration of the clips. While French is the official language of Ivory Coast, Baoule is also a major language spoken in the country.  The video circulating on social media alleging that Boko Haram is forcing commuters in Niger State of Nigeria to convert to Islam is false. The purported footage was taken out of its original context of 11 videos and used to depict an entirely untrue narrative.

"Claim: A video uploaded on YouTube claims that Dr. Isa Pantami, the minister of communications has been sacked by President Buhari.","A video on YouTube shared on April 20th, 2021  claims that Dr. Isa Pantami, the minister of communication, has been sacked by President Buhari. Dr. Pantami, who has been under fire over acclaimed extremist comments he has made in the past, has also been the subject of discussion in recent times. As some call for his resignation, others are of the contrary opinion.  It is in line with these ongoing happenings that a video, shared by a YouTube channel (Independent TV 7) purports that the minister has been sacked by president Buhari.  The video has attracted over 290 views within 48 hours of its appearance. This may in part be because of the dashing headline that was tagged to the video: “Breaking News!! BUHARI Order The Sack Of Isa PANTAMI And Been Kicked Out…” First, DUBAWA uncovered that there was no news story anywhere online, particularly from credible media outlets, that relates to Pantami’s sack, aside from the claim. Furthermore, the narrative in the video turned out to be redundant, as nowhere was it stated in the eight-minutes video that the minister had been sacked.  The headline was merely a hooker that was neither mentioned in the video nor  clearly expressed or specified in the video.  When DUBAWA reached out to Ms. Uwa Suleiman, the spokesperson to the Minister of Communications, she clarified in a phone conversation that the claim is false. “This is not true, please disregard,” she said. In the same vein, the Special Assistant to the President, Garba Shehu, also confirmed that the claim is totally untrue.  This is not the first time DUBAWA has come across misleading headlines with unrelated content, such as in this case. Though multiple controversies have been looming around the minister of communication and digital economy, Dr. Isa Ali Pantami, President Mohammed Buhari has not sacked him. Therefore, the claim, as depicted in the headline of the Youtube video is false; it is a case of misleading headline and baseless content.

"Claim: A viral video on Facebook claims that Boko Haram hoisted its flag in Niger State, Nigeria.","Claim: A viral video on Facebook claims that Boko Haram hoisted its flag in Niger State, Nigeria. The claim The claim that Boko Haram has hoisted its flag in Niger State, Nigeria, is false. The incident shown in the footage was discovered to have taken place at the Ajdabiya western gate in Libya during the country’s civil war back in 2011. Hence, this claim is false.   The growing rate of insecurity in Nigeria is no doubt alarming. A wide range of  the growing concern amongst the citizenry is linked  to the increase in  banditry, kidnapping, terrorism, and clashes between farmers and herders across the country.  This reality has over the years made security issues a topic of growing concern that induces frenzy. Therefore, talk of insecurity has dominated the Nigerian information space and seems to be building up fear amongst Nigerians.  As the recent turn of events announces the presence of Boko Haram in Niger state of Nigeria, a specific claim maintains that Boko Haram has hoisted its flag in the state.  The claim, which was shared on Facebook as a video, depicts an array of gunmen, trooping in vehicles while shooting sporadically into the air in what appears to be a jubilant display. The video was headlined “Boko Haram hosted their flag in Niger state, 2hrs drive to Abuja can’t you see that Nigeria is no longer Nigeria?” This statement implyies that the gunmen in the video were members of a jihadist group was located not very far from Abuja, Nigeria’s federal capital. Like most security topics of its kind, the claim has amassed almost 3,000 reactions, 262,000 views, over 8,000 shares and garnered close to 2,000 comments that  cut across different opinions at the time this report was filed.  One of the commenters, Obehi Francis Ekeoba, stated that “Nigerians should all get ready and be prepared for war. It is coming and the earlier we are prepared the better for us. War is inevitable at this time” while another user, Hussain Hussan Suleiman Dogonyaro, argued that “the whole road to Niger doesn’t have this kind of fine road, even inside Niger many places don’t have this kind of road so which side is this in Niger that we don’t know.” DUBAWA first uncovered that the same video under scrutiny had once appeared in 2014 with a different narrative purporting that Boko Haram had taken control of Giwa barracks in Borno State.  Subsequently, however,  when key-frames of the video were analysed on InVid video verifier,  results showed that the video first appeared online in 2011, depicting a scene displayed by Libyan soldiers loyal to Moammar Gadhafi as they jubilantly entered the  city of Ajdabiya, through its western gates. Even so, further proof shows the purported video actually took place at the western gates of Ajdabiya in Libya and not in Niger stated, Nigeria, as claimed.  1mage 1 Image 2 Evidently,  the Ajdabiya western gate is a prominent location in Libya and not anywhere in Niger state, Nigeria.  The incident in the video purported to have occurred in Niger State, Nigeria, is confirmed to have apparently taken place at the western gates of Ajdabiya in Libya, during the Libyan civil war in 2011.

Claim: A news report by Weetalknaija claims Garba Shehu said the killings in Benue will continue until Ortom cooperates with Buhari.,"Benue State has been on the map for the killings of its citizens/residents, from the killing of one officer and 10 soldiers who were on stabilisation operation in the state to the killing of seven Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in a camp in Abagena, a Makurdi suburb on Monday, April 25, 2021. Reacting to these killings, governor Samuel Ortom said the unfortunate development could have been averted if the federal government was proactive, noting that over 70 persons were killed within two weeks in Makurdi, Gwer West and Guma Local Government Area (LGAs). He explained that he had alerted the nation when Fulanis from 14 countries met in Yola and declared that except Benue reviews the prohibition of open grazing law, it will not know peace. He added that he had written to the federal government to arrest the leaders of Miyetti Allah that hosted that meeting, but nothing was done. On the heels of this development, a report by Weetalknaija on Friday, April 30, 2021, claims President Muhammadu Buhari’s Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, said the killing will continue if Ortom does not cooperate with Buhari. Dubawa studied the report by Weetalknaija and also conducted a keyword search which led to other reports by different news platforms. Going through this report, which quoted Buhari’s spokesperson, Garba Shehu, as making this claim in its headline, Dubawa observed that this claim was not contained in the body of the news report. The body of the report  noted Mr Shehu called  on the Ortom government to cooperate with the Federal Government in implementing national strategies to end this issue.  A report by Premium Times based on the same statement by Garba Shehu gave a different narrative. This report noted that the president was disappointed with governor Ortom’s comment in reaction to these killings. Another report by the International Centre for Investigative Reporting (ICIR) shares the same narrative of the president’s disappointment with the Premium Times report.  Dubawa also obtained the press release these stories were based on and noted there was nowhere in the statement that reflected weetalknaija’s headline. The press release only called for the cooperation of the Ortom-led government.  The news report that claims Garba Shehu said the killings in Benue State will continue unless Ortom cooperates with Buhari is false and misleading. Our findings show this was just a sensational headline as the content of the story and the press release contradicts the headline.

Claim: A Facebook post claims BB-905 aircraft is a locally made fighter Jet made by Biafra many years ago.,"Biafra or the Republic of Biafra was a secessionist state that existed from May 1967 to January 1970 during the Nigerian Civil War. Its territory consisted of the Eastern Region of Nigeria In 1967, following two coups and turmoil which led to about a million Igbos returning to the southeast of Nigeria, the Republic of Biafra seceded with 33-year-old military officer Emeka Odumegwu Ojukwu at the helm. The Nigerian government declared war and after 30 months of fighting, Biafra surrendered. On 15 January 1970, the conflict officially ended. On Monday April 19, 2021, a Facebook post by Tariere Fiebai was shared by another Facebook user, Choji Tosanwumi Pwoi. The post had 8 reactions, 9 comments and 2 shares. According to this post accompanied by the picture of a “Jet”, this Jet was 100% manufactured by Biafrans in 1968. “This Jet was manufactured 100% by the Biafrans in 1968. If you don’t tell your story…another will with versions that suit him.” A comment under this post by Micheal Dedon disagreed with this, questioning the author’s knowledge of what a jet looks like. He also added this was a sky wagon made in the United States (US) and Canada. “Madam, check the background well and study the serial number and flag on the plane. Does the environment look local to you? That is a variant of the Cessna 185 Skywagon made in the US and Canada.” A Jet is one of the most common types of air planes in use today, having largely replaced traditional aircraft powered by propellers. Although propeller planes still exist, Jets dominate commercial and private air travel owing to their greater speed, ability to fly at higher altitudes and mechanical reliability. Also, a Google reverse image search on the image showed the aircraft in the image was the Cessna 185 Skywagon, not a Jet. This is a six-seat, single-engined light aircraft manufactured by Cessna. A Facebook post by NKANU TV shared by Mhista Sampuwa Samuel claims this is a Biafran BB- 905 locally manufactured fighter jet used during the civil war. This post was shared on the same date (April 19) that Fiebai shared his post. A Twitter user Olaudah Equiano @RealOlaudah also shared the same image with a similar caption and #NigerianHistory. This Tweet also made on April 19 had 848 retweets, 37 quote retweets, and 2,313 likes.  Dubawa also conducted a keyword search to find if Jets were used during the Biafran war. We found a Biafran Air Force B26 aircraft which looked nothing like the aircraft in the viral image. This search also led to some images on Pinterest similar to the image above. Pinterest also described it as the Biafran Air Force B26 aircraft. Another result showed pictures of aircraft for Biafra (Biafran Invaders) although there were different stories to explain this. The pictures in this article also do not look like the one that has gone viral and it was noted that the aircraft was purchased not made. If this aircraft is not for Biafra, then where is it from? To answer this, Dubawa conducted another search using the number (BB-905) on the aircraft in the image to find its origin. We found from the United States Department of Transportation that this aircraft was from the United States and was manufactured in 1981 many years after the Biafran war. The image alleged to be a locally manufactured fighter Jet by Biafra is false. All investigations show the aircraft used during the war was purchased and the aircraft looks nothing like the BB-905 in the claim.

"Claim: According to a viral WhatsApp message, the COVID-19 vaccine shortens your life span and leads to impotency","As vaccine rollout continues, we have seen an increasing spread of conspiracy theories and misinformation, including claims that the vaccine has been weaponised to depopulate the world. Recently, a viral WhatsApp message claims that the vaccine reduces the lifespan of as many that took the vaccine. For people below 50 years of age, they are expected to die within 5-10 years while those above 70 will die within 2-3 years.  The message which was attributed to one professor Dolores Cahill also claims the vaccine makes people impotent. “anyone who got the vaccine will be dead within 5-10 years time. If you are over 70years old and got the vaccine, -you will be dead within 2-3 years time. But most importantly you become impotent first.” Doctor Dolores Cahill up until March 18, 2021,  was a University College Dublin (UCD) professor, who chaired the Eurosceptic Irish Freedom Party, before her resignation on March 22, 2021. Her incessant online claims around COVID-19 led to a request for her to resign from a leading European Union’s scientific committee and her removal from her lecturing role. DUBAWA’s keyword search did not yield any useful result as we could not find the WhatsApp claim anywhere online outside WhatsApp. We, however, saw other claims made by the professor. Dr Cahill who was the Professor of Translational Science at the UCD School of Medicine has been one of the leading advocates against lockdown and mask-wearing during the Covid-19 pandemic. She once said that children who wore face masks were being “starved” of oxygen and would have lower IQ. She also claimed that Lockdown and social distancing are not needed to stop the spread of the virus, as people who recover are “immune for life” after 10 days. She also said death and illnesses can be prevented by extra vitamins like vitamins C, D and zinc. Opposing vaccinations, she also said politicians and the media are using COVID-19 as a fear-mongering propaganda tool to try and take away rights from people to make them sicker and to force vaccinations on them. DUBAWA reached out to the World Health Organisation (WHO) which noted that Dr Cahill’s claim is false, as available COVID-19 vaccines have been assessed for safety and have also been found not to interfere with the human Deoxyribonucleic (DNA). “There is no evidence of this. COVID-19 vaccines, including mRNA vaccines, save lives and prevent serious illness from COVID-19. The COVID-19 mRNA vaccine technology has been rigorously assessed for safety, and clinical trials have shown that mRNA vaccines provide a long-lasting immune response. mRNA vaccine technology has been studied for several decades, including in the contexts of Zika, rabies, and influenza vaccines. mRNA vaccines are not live virus vaccines and do not interfere with human DNA.” The claim that the COVID-19 vaccine makes one impotent is false as the possibility of impotency has been discussed only in association with the virus, not the vaccine. A 2020 study has suggested COVID-19 survivors might develop sexual and reproductive health issues; however, the study noted that evidence from diagnostic procedures, such as penile color-doppler ultrasound and hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis evaluation is necessary to assess the extent to which COVID-19 has been able to impair erectile, and finally vascular, function. Relatedly, vaccination and adhering to recommended COVID-19 guidelines have been advised to avoid any possible side effect associated with COVID-19. Also,  DUBAWA’s explainer throws more light on the COVID-19 vaccine and fertility issues for both men and women. This article shows fertility of men and women is not affected by COVID-19 vaccines. While studies on the virus continue, the Centre for Disease Control (CDC) and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists notes that none of the vaccines rolled out so far has been found to make men or women infertile.  The claim attributed to Professor Cahill is false and misleading as Dubawa could not find anywhere the professor made this claim. In addition, the WHO, and other studies and reports do not agree with this claim. Even if the claim was made by the professor, her reputation with propagating a number of strongly rejected claims about COVID-19 questions her credibility and makes COVID-19 information from her not trustworthy.

Claim: A Twitter post claims killings at Igbariam/Akwuzu were carried out by Fulani men,"A Twitter user Nelson Obidon (King) (@Ph_Obidon) made a Twitter post on Monday April 26, 2021, with two videos claiming house to house killing was ongoing at Igbariam junction. In the first nine-seconds video, which has gained over 154,000 views as of Tuesday April 27, 2021, the narrator asked people in the area to find somewhere safe. “You can see it, it’s no longer safe, please those that are staying in the junction find a place and relocate.” In the second 11 seconds video which had gathered about 101,000 views, the Twitter user claims the men in the video (unarmed), who were over 10, were responsible for the killing. However, in the comment section, there were contradicting explanations. While some users sympathised with the victims, others gave a different narrative of what actually happened and some called for confirmation of the event. A user in the comment section named Bashir Iliya (@bershir) shared a 31-seconds video of some men taking the victims away. He said the men who were speaking Fulfude were relatives to the victims who were killed by members of Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB). Using different search engines, Dubawa conducted different reverse image searches on screenshots from the first video in the Twitter post. However, this search did not produce useful or related results. Also, reverse image searches were conducted on screenshots from the second video in the Twitter post with no useful or related results. A keyword search of the location named in the Twitter post showed Igbariam is in Anambra State of Nigeria A look at the location on google map shows this is close to the Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu University’s Igbariam campus. A close look at the videos shared by the poster (Obidon) and which shared in the comment section by Bashir showed similarities in the victims, the wrappers and mats around them. Obidon claimed they were victims of Fulani/Hausa looking men but this raises the question of why Northerners will Kill their own and still come back to pick up the dead bodies. DUBAWA spoke with a resident of that area, who said he couldn’t give much detail as he heard gunshots around 2 a.m. and rumours that people were killed. He, however, noted the victims were Fulani. “I can’t say much about it but I will say what I know. Around 2 am, I heard a gunshot, not once, not twice. The next morning, I heard a rumour that some people were killed at the back of my area. So, I figured it was the gunshot I heard at midnight. So I rushed to the area, some children were slaughtered. The people they killed were Fulani people. They live in the same area with students.” When asked about the perpetrators, he said “It happened in the middle of the night. It did not happen in the afternoon. It happened right behind my lodge. I can remember that around 1:30 my generator went off and the students in my room left to their various rooms so I was still awake. Not up to 30 minutes I started hearing gunshots. I can’t say if these people were wearing Fulani clothing, but I noticed some of them wore polos (I saw in the shadow) when I heard the gunshot I looked through the window, some were with torchlight.” Speaking on the location and why Igbariam Junction cannot be traced on google map, he explained that “We call the area Igbariam but on the normal location as it is on the map of Nigeria, it’s called Awkuzu but people call it Igbariam due to the school in the area.” DUBAWA also reached out to the Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP), Ikenga Tochukwu, Anambra State Police Public Relations Officer (PRO), who sent a statement he had earlier written.  According to the statement, “‘armed men violently attacked” a community identified as Ukpomachi Village in Awkuzu, Oyi Local Government Area of the state.  The incident was said to have happened in the ‘early hours of Monday, 26th, April 2021. However, normalcy has been restored to the neighbourhood and security has also been provided to avoid a recurrence. A more detailed statement was also received from the Commissioner for information and Public Enlightenment, C. Don Adinuba, by DUBAWA. DUBAWA deduced from the statement, that the event happened in the early hours of Monday (no specific time was mentioned), and that there was a clash between some people in Uzo Nkwo, Awkuzu, and some non-indigenes (some were killed and some were maimed, both sides recorded casualties). In the statement, the police claimed that the pictures on social media were old and unrelated to what happened recently in Awkuzu and have contradicting captions.  The statement added that claims of heinous killings and murders are made up, hence the circulation of still images and not videos. According to the statement, horrid pictures were shared to taint the image of the ‘safest and most peaceful’ state in the whole country. Despite this statement, DUBAWA has not come across any pictures but videos that we are yet to see anywhere else to contradict the claim by the police that they are recirculated. Firstly, apart from the viral video and some screenshots, there were no circulated pictures of the incident on the internet.  Further, searches confirm that there were no recirculated images of the incident as claimed by the police. Reverse searches only returned recent videos. Although it has been confirmed from different sources that killings took place in Akwuzu, Anambra State, we cannot confirm the location of the videos making the rounds, but our search shows they are not recirculated videos. We also do not have substantial evidence to categorically state who the perpetrators or victims were.

Claim: Video showing people crossing the Ngueli bridge in Chad into Cameroon.,"A viral video, circulated on Twitter, WhatsApp, and Instagram has generated conversation on the possible inflow of refugees from Chad into Cameroon. The video, mostly without sound, shows a large number of people moving across a bridge which runs over a water body.  The video in itself did not indicate the location of the bridge or give any information on the ongoing situation. Accompanying the video, however, is a text that states: “Right now, hundreds of thousands of Chadian refugees are crossing over the Ngueli bridge to the Republic of Cameroon, less than 40kms to the Nigerian border.” “Yesterday, hundreds of thousands of Chadian refugees were crossing over the Ngueli bridge to the Republic of Cameroon, less than 40kms to the Nigerian border. They may eventually cross to Nigeria unless their country stabilises becos Cameroun are hostile. Govt should take action!” The accompanying messages suggest that many Chadians fear a deterioration of the political situation in the country following the death of Former President Idriss Deby at the front line. Following his death, Mr Deby’s son Mahamat Idriss Déby Itno, was appointed to lead the country for 18 months until elections, a move the opposition party and many Chadians opposed. However, the rebels, whom President Deby fought for many years, vowed to reclaim the capital, N’Djaména, an announcement instilling fears in citizens. For fear of violence, many residents of the capital were seen fleeing on Tuesday. This development prompted fears of possible refugee situations in neighbouring countries, especially Nigeria and Cameroon. One of such videos claiming Chadians are crossing a border bridge into Cameroon went viral with many commenters calling on both Nigerian and Cameroonian governments to take action against such migration. To begin with, Dubawa noticed that no major news platform had carried any such news, raising a red flag. Dubawa tracked the conversations around the video and came across an Instagram user, @chikacharles, who stated that he lives in Chad and added that indeed the event seen in the video took place on the Ngueli bridge. Basic google search revealed that the Ngueli Bridge connects Ndjamena, the capital of Chad, to Kousseri, a town in the far north of Cameroon. Using Google search of the Ngueli bridge, we came across the following images. Gettyimages also had a collection of images from the Ngueli bridge which suggest that the Reuters image above is accurate.  From observation, it is clear that the bridge in the video and that in the pictures do not look the same. A feature that stands out is the support beams for the bridge. The support beams in the video show a single beam instead of the double beam bridge from the Ngueli bridge image. Furthermore, a google map image of the Ngueli bridge shows a double, side-by-side structure as opposed to the single structure in the video, suggesting that the bridges are not the name. Firstly, we searched for bridges over the Chari river and looked through the related images. We identified the Ngueli bridge and another bridge which had a similar structure to the one in the video.  Further search was conducted on the image above and we discovered that the bridge bears many similarities to the bridge seen in the video. By comparing shots from the video and the images generated in Google maps, we were able to pinpoint this bridge to be on the Djamena-Moundou road in N’Djamena. We did this using the wall, sand site/construction site, the circled trees and the roofed structures as seen in the screenshots from the images below. By Using Google Maps and Google Maps Pro, we identified the images from the screenshots of the video as seen below. The Ngueli bridge goes over the Logone river while the bridge in the video goes over the Chari river. This would imply that the people going over the bridge would not be in Cameroon once they get across the bridge but will still be in Chad. The video showing people’s movement did not take place on the Ngueli bridge as suggested by the texts accompanying the video but rather a bridge on the Djamena-Moundou road in N’Djamena. This bridge is different from the Ngueli bridge that connects N’Djamena, Chad’s capital, to Kousseri in Cameroon.

Claim: a viral video making rounds on social media claims that soldiers have arrested and flogged ‘Fulani herdsmen kidnappers’ along the Ife-Ibadan road.,"Insecurity in Nigeria has become a major discourse in both the public sphere and media circle. Since 2009, security has not only taken a considerable part of the nation’s financial budget but has also taken a chunk of newspaper headlines. This reality has, however, placed security matters in the spotlight, alluring massive traction anytime anything related to security is shared. A good example is a video circulating on social media which claims that soldiers have arrested ‘Fulani herdsmen kidnappers’ along the Ife-Ibadan road. Not only that, the video depicted men in Nigerian military gear engrossed with the flogging of some shirtless persons whom the video alleged to be suspected Fulani herdsmen kidnappers arrested by soldiers of the Nigerian army.  The video is collaged alongside a narrative that states, “Fulani herdsmen arrested by soldiers along Ife-Ibadan road. The soldiers posed as passengers in a commercial vehicle from where they caught them in their operation. They left their cattle in the bush. Nemesis will still catch up with many more of them. ”  The claim has appeared on YouTube, January, 21st 2021, and attracted more than 1000 views; with comments that neither showed doubts nor skepticism towards the story the video has depicted.  The video has also been forwarded multiple times on WhatsApp across different groups and forums and though it did not offer a specific time period as to when the event actually took place, its recent appearance on the social media space appears to pose it as a fresh occurrence.  The sensitivity of security matters and information has been a considerable causal factor of unrest in society, especially when it is presented in a visual format, such as the claim at hand.  Even more, the claim may also have lethal implications, considering the ongoing debate regarding the presence of herdsmen in the southern part of Nigeria and the recent reports of herdsmen attacks in Osun. Summatively, this may end up crumbling the fragile security structure of those areas. Sequel to this circumstance, DUBAWA opted to establish the fact about this claim, especially to determine when and where it actually took place.  Before anything else, DUBAWA traced another version of the video with a slightly different narrative that was shared on YouTube on 26th June 2019. The chronicle attached to this version outlines: “Little can be said about the menace caused by  herdsmen in the country for a while in the country. These herdsmen were cautioned by officers of The Nigerian Armed Forces for grazing on farmlands. What’s your take on this?  Yay or nah”.  While the other narrative professes that the acclaimed herdsmen were captured by the soldiers for kidnapping and gave the story a flair of recency, the other one suggests it was because of grazing on the farmland back in 2019.  This apparent contradiction even raises questions around the actual time the incident took place. Nonetheless, DUBAWA uncovered that the incident actually happened in 2019.  However, the major distinction is that it happened in Shinkafi Local Government Area (LGA) in Zamfara State and not along the Ife-Ibadan road as the claim purported.  Interestingly, it turned out that the  Nigerian Air Force spokesman, Air Commodore Ibikunle Daramola, had condemned the action back in 2019 in a statement he released to the press. He clearly stated that “The attention of the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) has been drawn to a video and some pictures circulating on some social media and online platforms showing some military personnel flogging suspected armed bandits at Shinkafi Local Government Area (LGA) in Zamfara State. The NAF has discovered that some of its personnel were part of the joint team stationed at the Galadi Sub-Sector at the time. The NAF wishes to state unequivocally that the troops’ actions of flogging and physically assaulting the disarmed suspects were totally unacceptable and not in consonance with the Standing Operating Procedures (SOPs) guiding the conduct of the operation.”  Further shreds of evidence from the acclaimed video also confirm the incident happened somewhere in the northwest because, at 1:59 timing of the video one of the soldiers said “we are not only SHARAN DAJI we are operation 777, regardless.” The operation SHARAN DAJI or 777 is a unit of the Nigerian army that was set up in 2015 to respond to the crises of banditry, cattle rustling, and kidnapping in the northwestern part of Nigeria with a primary focus on Zamfara.  Tolu Ogunlesi, the Special Assistant to President Buhari on Digital and New Media, had in 2019, around the time of the incident confirmed that the SHARAN DAJI is primarily stationed in the northwest.  This implies that the incident did not happen along the Ife-Ibadan road as claimed,  because the particular army unit is not functional and stationed there.   Although the acclaimed incident actually took place, the real narrative regarding where and when it took place was slanted to forge a rather misleading story around the video. Thus this claim is misleading because the event happened in   Shinkafi, Zamfara State, and not along the Ife-Ibadan road.

Claim: The screenshot of a report by Mail Online makes several claims about showering.,"Bathing or showering is the washing of the body with a liquid, usually water or an aqueous solution, or the immersion of the body in water. This is done for personal hygiene, religious ritual, or therapeutic purposes. While bathing and showering are used interchangeably, they differ slightly. A report by Mail Online came with a number of claims on showering. One of these claims is that excessive showering can reduce skin hydration and make it dry and cracked. It also claims cracked skin may allow infection-causing germs to enter people’s bodies and that bathing mainly removes odours rather than reducing peoples’ risk of illness. The report also added that washing strips the skin of good bacteria that support the immune system and experts insist showering just once or twice a week is sufficient for most, A report by Healthline noted that there are no hard or fast rules on how much is too much bathing, so it’s important that everyone knows their body and determines what their skin can tolerate. The report also highlighted some tips to bathe correctly and protect the skin, like taking a shower once a day,  using warm water in place of hot water, limiting shower time to 5 to 10 minutes, avoiding cleansers and soaps with fragrances or deodorants etc. Another report by the Atlantic in 2020 claims most people are showering too much but noted that  out-of-balance skin microbiome isn’t just the result of too much soap and scrubbing but also a result of exposure to preservatives with antimicrobial properties. Dubawa also reached out to health experts; a dermatologist and a gynaecologist to speak on these claims.  Both experts disagree that showering dehydrates the skin. One of the health experts we spoke to, Jerry Agim, a gynaecologist, said showering does not dehydrate the skin but washes off the natural skin oil (sebum). “Taking your bath does not dehydrate the skin, it cleanses it off micro-organism and helps shed dead skin. Bathing also cleans off the sweat produced by the sweat gland which can be acted upon by bacteria to cause odour. Some people naturally have dry skin while others have oily skin. After taking your bath, the body produces its natural oil to lubricate the skin which happens very fast for oily skin and slower for dry skin individuals.” A dermatologist, Dr Ayo Aranmolate, said there is nothing like excess showering, noting the only thing that can dehydrate the skin is insensible loss(the amount of fluid lost on a daily basis). “There is nothing like excess showering can reduce hydration, it’s just like saying washing your car. There is nothing like excess showering. There is no human being that can be in the shower forever, even if you spend a lot of time there, you can’t sleep there. The skin is more or less water proof otherwise when you stay in the bathtub, the body should absorb more water into the body. The only thing that can dehydrate the skin is insensible loss. There is what we call insensible loss when it comes to humans. Like breathing is a form of insensible loss, Diarrhea, is also a form.” “There is nothing like that. When you have your bath, you basically remove dirt from your skin. Even when you have your bath, there are still some things that can never be removed because if you still take a swab of the skin, and take it to the lab, it will still grow some organisms, they are called normal commensal. The only time when you have an infection is if the normal commensal starts growing above a particular level. we usually say 10  rays to power 6 of that organism growing in that area, that is when a commensal can become an infection”. “Well yea this is possible if you are using ….which is why some women when they are douching, they are stripping off some good organism. Not that they are good organisms, they are bad organisms in the first place but they go there to regulate things there. So if you strip them off from that area, another group of organisms will overpopulate that area. It’s just like having aliens among humans and you take off more than the normal humans who are supposed to protect the land, the new organism will populate the place and take over. “There is nothing like that, if your body is hot, just go and have your bath, its as simple as that. If you feel uncomfortable, you are sweaty, just go and have your bath. The only time I realise people don’t take their bath is in a cold place. Dr Agim also added that although he is not a dermatologist, he recommends one bath per day, adding that there are benefits from bathing. “I am not a dermatologist but I will suggest at least once a day. To maintain healthy skin you have to take care of your skin by; adequate hydration(drink at least 3L/day), stay out of the sun if possible, wear protective clothing in the sun and during dry weather conditions like harmattan, eat adequate nutrition, take your bath and apply moisturizer, use UV protection (some cream now come with UV protection). Also cleaning your skin helps keep your pores open through which oil and sweat is released to the skin surface. Bathing can help regulate your body’s temperature too. Tepid sponging (cleaning the body with lukewarm water) is used even in the hospital to manage fever.” This collection of claims around showering has been seen to be a mixture of true and false information. Health experts note that there is nothing like excess showering and the frequency of showers depends on different factors like skin type, activities, environment etc. The claim that cracks/breaks in the skin can lead to infection and that washing can strip the skin of good bacteria is true.

"CLAIM: Nigerian Army released pictures showing destroyed vehicles, guns and ammunition recovered from its victory over Islamic State West African Province (ISWAP) terrorists in Damasak.","On Friday 16th April 2021, the Nigerian Army via its official Twitter handle (@HQNigerianArmy), shared a report of its victory over Islamic State West African Province (ISWAP) terrorists in Damasak, Borno State, North-East Nigeria. The Army also posted pictures of multiple damaged vehicles, as well as arms and ammunition purportedly belonging to the terrorists. In the report titled “How ISWAP Senior Commander, Fighters on Revenge Mission Met Their Waterloo at Damasak”, the Nigerian Army said the terrorists “met their waterloo as they made a come-back following the neutralization of 12 high value ISWAP commanders in Mobbar LGA in a week-long air and ground operations”. The Twitter post also included a link to the complete report. Continuing on the Army’s Official Facebook Page, the report signed by Mohammed Yerima, a Brigadier General and Army Spokesperson, said the victory over the terrorists was a result of well-coordinated ground bombardments and aerial strikes by the Nigerian military on various locations in the Northeast. The statement read: “A senior Commander of ISWAP, Bukar Gana Fitchmeram (aka Abu Aisha), and scores of his fighters who were on revenge mission at Damasak, fell to the fire power of Nigerian troops Thursday. The terrorist and his fighters met their waterloo as they made a come-back following the neutralization of 12 high value ISWAP commanders in Mobbar Local Government Area of Borno State in a week-long air and ground operations by the Nigerian military. “In a well-coordinated ground bombardments and aerial strikes by the Nigerian military on various locations in the Northeast, the terrorists who were denied any sanctuary or respite desperately conducted two separate failed attacks on Gajiram and Damasak. “The deadly air strikes conducted on Tudun Wulgo, Zari and Tumbun Alhaji, Kusuma, Sigir in Ngala and Arijallamari, in Abadam, Marte and Ngala Local government Areas, led to the killing of top ISWAP Leaders. The Commanders that perished in the airstrikes included; Mohammad Fulloja, Ameer Mallam Bello, Ba’a kaka Tunkushe, Abu Muktar Al -Ansari, Ameer Abba Kaka, Abu Huzaifa, Ameer Modu Kwayem, while Goni Mustapha who was the Chief Imam of the ISWAP escaped with bullet wounds. “Troops’ artillery bombardment and air strikes on April 6 also resulted to the elimination of two top ISWAP leaders including Abu-Rabi and Muhammed Likita as well as scores of their troops and body guards around the axis of Kusuma, Sigir in Ngala and Arijallamari in Abadam Local Government Areas. “The terrorists’ storage facilities that housed weapons used to conduct several attacks was also targeted and destroyed in the air raid by the Air Component of Operation Lafita Dole. “On the night of Saturday, April 10, three other terrorist Commanders including Ameer Umar, Abu Ubaida and Abu Salim were ambushed and killed by own troops around Wulgo/Logomani axis close to Cameroon borders while attempting to attack locals and rustle their cows. The devastating air strikes and artillery bombardment on the ISWAP camps had pushed the surviving elements to conduct desperate attacks and looting missions for food and drugs for their wounded colleagues. “Also, on April 11, the Nigerian military bombardments eliminated scores of ISWAP/Boko Haram terrorists on five guntrucks in Damasak. Some of the terrorists were hits close to the perimeter fencing, while others were neutralized while attempting to loot food items in a store belonging to the United Nations as well as drugs and ambulance. However, three soldiers and some civilians lost their lives while properties were burnt in the town. “Some of the terrorist still got access to the town burning and looting items before vacating the area. It is also noteworthy that Damasak has been attacked several times and failed. Troops’ fighting spirit remains very high in spite of the nefarious activities of some local informants who often tip the Boko Haram/ISWAP terrorists on troops’ movements and positions.” A Google reverse image and Twitter search by Dubawa showed that the pictures recently shared by the Nigerian Army, had previously been posted in March 2021, on social media by a Twitter user Calibre Obscura (@CalibreObscura), referring to an earlier ISIS attack in Damasak, Borno State.   The Twitter user with the description “Arms Research and Occasional Effortposter” posted on 15th March 2021: “After a large ISIS attack in #Damasak (VBIED used), images have been posted of 9 AKs, an RPG-7 and an NSV HMG recovered by NA along with two technicals, all burned out. Currently unclear who their original owner was. ISIS claim 12 dead/wounded, but no proof yet.” But, on Friday 16th April 2021, barely a month after they were first shared, the Nigerian Army published the same pictures attached to a report claiming it had killed about 13 commanders of the dreaded terrorist sects, Boko Haram and the Islamic State West African Province (ISWAP). The pictures posted by the Nigerian Army on Friday 16th April 2021, describing its victory over Islamic State West African Province (ISWAP) terrorists had appeared on the internet about a month earlier on 15th March 2021, showing evidence of an attack in Damasak, Borno State, involving the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS).

Claim: A viral meme claims inserting garlic clove  helps remove pain in the ear,"Naturopathic medicine/treatment is a system that uses natural remedies to help the body heal itself. It embraces many therapies, including herbs, massages, acupuncture, exercise, and nutritional counselling. Garlic is a plant in the Allium (onion) family closely related to onions, shallots, and leeks. Each segment of a garlic bulb is called a clove. There are about 10–20 cloves in a single bulb, give or take. A meme making the rounds claims Garlic helps remove pain in the ear, helps with ear infection and headaches. According to this meme, putting a clean garlic clove in the ear provides relief, like an earplug. “Garlic helps remove pain in the ears, ear infections and headaches quickly and effectively. simply put a clean garlic clove in your ear- it fits perfectly in the ear, as an earplug until you feel relief.” Dubawa conducted a keyword search on Garlic and its health benefits. A report by Healthline noted that garlic has scientifically proven benefits which include its antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal properties, and anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving properties.  One of the studies done in 2001 with 103 children who had ear pain from middle ear infections, found that naturopathic ear drops containing garlic (Allium sativum) and other herbal ingredients were just as effective in managing ear pain as over-the-counter (OTC) ear drops. The study result shows that both Allicin (an organosulfur compound obtained from garlic) and SAC showed antimicrobial activity against the tested microorganisms, even at low concentrations. Dubawa’s search also led to a report of a man in China who ended up in the hospital after trying to cure an ear infection by shoving a clove of garlic into his ear.  According to the man identified as Mr Kang who had this clove stuck in his ear for two months, he read somewhere online that garlic was a good anti-inflammatory, so he put one in his ear.

Claim: a viral WhatsApp message claims that taking painkillers such as diclofenac after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine is harmful and can lead to death.,"The controversy around the COVID-19 vaccine has been prevalent since its emergence. Several arguments around its efficacy, effectiveness, affordability, regardless of its have led to the proposition of multiple theories regarding the Vaccine. Recently, a piece of viral information making rounds on WhatsApp claims that taking pain killers like Diclofenac and others after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine can be hazardous and may even lead to death.  The claim ties the narrative to the demise of a certain Dr. Hari Harini who was alleged to have died when her  doctor-husband injected her with a dose of Diclofenac after she had earlier received the COVID-19 vaccine. The information was shared multiple times on WhatsApp, accompanied by the picture of the acclaimed late doctor and her husband together.  COVID-19 vaccine-related claims have attracted massive traction in the past, its sensitivity and risk to people’s health and general wellbeing cannot be underestimated. It is because of this reality that DUBAWA opts to confirm the veracity of the information.   As regards the doctor’s death, DUBUWA uncovered that multiple fact checks have already been conducted which confirmed the doctor’s death but ruled out taking pain killers as the causative factor.  According to a fact-check conducted by India’s Thenewsminute, findings outlined that “Doctors have ruled out the COVID-19 vaccine as the reason behind the death of a young woman doctor in Madurai on 11 March. The Medical Administrator of Meenakshi Mission Hospital, Madurai, Dr. Kannan told The News Minute that the woman doctor had been administered the COVID-19 vaccine on 5 February, a month before she was brought to the hospital in an unconscious state.”  So also on Thequint where the same findings were registered. Nonetheless, as regards pain killers being harmful and deadly after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, some guidelines issued by the Centre for Disease Control (CDC)  on the  Interim clinical considerations for use of COVID-19 vaccines currently authorized in the United States advised that “It is not recommended you take these medicines (pain killers) before vaccination for the purpose of trying to prevent side effects. Talk to your doctor about taking over-the-counter medications, such as ibuprofen, acetaminophen, aspirin, or antihistamines, for any pain and discomfort you may experience after getting vaccinated. You can take these medications to relieve post-vaccination side effects if you have no other medical reasons that prevent you from taking these medications normally.” A study published in the Journal of Virology conducted on whether to take pain relievers after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine also found that “nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) which include painkillers like ibuprofen reduced the production of antibodies and other aspects of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.” Since antibodies are proteins made by the immune system to fight viruses like SARS-CoV-2. The COVID-19 vaccines stimulate the body to produce antibodies that specifically target the coronavirus without causing disease. Thus the authors of this study explained that this raises the possibility that pain killers might also affect the immune response to coronavirus vaccination. Also, Dr. Sherrill Brown, medical director of infection prevention at AltaMed Health Services, a federally qualified healthcare center serving Los Angeles and Orange counties in California,  agreed with the findings of the study, adding that “I would recommend waiting until someone experiences side effects of fever or pain that require fever-reducing or pain-reducing medications,” she said, “and not to take them as a prophylaxis to prevent vaccine-related symptoms.” Dr. Brown further explained that “Some people are not able to take either acetaminophen or ibuprofen due to other underlying health conditions,” she said. “In those cases, it would be best to consult with their trusted healthcare provider or physician before taking these medications. If you can’t take pain relievers, or you would like to avoid taking them after your coronavirus vaccine injection, there are other ways to relieve vaccination side effects. To reduce pain and discomfort at the site of injection, apply a cool, wet washcloth over the area to reduce the swelling. Gently exercising the arm also increases blood flow to the area which can provide additional relief.”  Unduibisi Okeke of the Limi Hospital, Abuja, a pharmacist, also shares similar views with Dr. Brown. He explained to DUBAWA that “the COVID-19 vaccine is alien to the body system. So, body pain is likely because of the effort the body system is making to adapt to the vaccine.” He added that  “If body pain perseveres, however, one can take just paracetamol not major pain relievers as diclofenac, etc.” Nonetheless, he concluded that “the Vaccine just came in recently and studies are still being carried out to understand its nature but it’s good to be on the safer side and avoid all sorts of pain relievers before or after the COVID-19 vaccine.” Findings show that taking pain relievers after the COVID-19 vaccine can indeed be hazardous, especially without a doctor’s prescription. Though further findings show the late doctor in question did not die of COVID-19 vaccine-related issues, experts have advised against the use of pain relievers before or after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine.

Claim: The screenshot of a report making the rounds claims a new HIV vaccine has a 97% antibody response rate in phase 1 human trial.,"The Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is an infection that attacks the body’s immune system, specifically the white blood cells called CD4 cells. HIV destroys these CD4 cells, thereby weakening a person’s immunity against infections such as tuberculosis and some cancers. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO) at the end of 2019, there were 38 million people living with HIV.  The WHO recommends that every person who may be at risk of HIV should access testing and people diagnosed with HIV should be offered and linked to antiretroviral treatment as soon after diagnosis. This treatment, if taken consistently, also prevents HIV transmission to others. HIV can be diagnosed using simple and affordable rapid diagnostic tests, as well as self-tests. It is, however, important that HIV testing services follow the 5Cs: consent, confidentiality, counselling, correct results, and connection with treatment and other services. Recently the screenshot of a story titled “Novel HIV vaccine approach shows promise in ‘Landmark’ trial” was being circulated on social media. This image claims there is a new HIV vaccine with a 97% antibody response rate in phase 1 human trial.  “Wow, new HIV vaccine with a 97% antibody response rate in phase I human trial. This is the most effective trial vaccine till date. It is based on Moderna’s COVID vaccine. COVID tech acceleration could change RX for Cancer and HIV in future.” Dubawa conducted a keyword search and found the original story on europeanpharmaciticalreview. The report stated that a novel vaccine approach for the prevention of HIV has shown promise in Phase I trials. According to IAVI and Scripps Research, the vaccine had successfully stimulated the production of the rare immune cells needed to generate antibodies against HIV in 97 percent of participants. Dubawa also found a press release by IAVI and Scripps research on February 3, 2021, announcing this feat with its clinical trial, IAVI G001, after Uhambo’s failure.  William Schief, a professor and immunologist at Scripps Research and executive director of vaccine design at IAVI’s Neutralizing Antibody Center (NAC), whose laboratory developed the vaccine, announced this result.  “This study demonstrates proof of principle for a new vaccine concept for HIV, a concept that could be applied to other pathogens, as well. We believe this approach will be key to making an HIV vaccine and possibly important for making vaccines against other pathogens.” The press release also revealed that IAVI and Scripps Research will be partnering with the biotechnology company Moderna to develop and test an mRNA-based vaccine that harnesses the approach to produce the same beneficial immune cells which could significantly accelerate the pace of HIV vaccine development. It is worthy of note, however, that this is just the first trial phase and there are two more phases for a vaccine to go through before it is approved or recommended. The claim that an HIV vaccine shows 97% antibody response in the phase 1 trial is true but this is just setting the stage for additional clinical trials which will seek to refine the effectiveness of the vaccine.

Claim: Having your spouse suck your breasts will reduce chances of getting breast cancer.,"Social media users and many online portals have circulated stories that suggest that the suckling of breasts, especially by spouses or partners, can reduce chances of breast cancer in both men and women. A Facebook post on March 18th, 2021, which suggested that women do not like their breasts sucked, generated comments  which once again brought out the claim in question. Members of the group within which the post was published responded, with many highlighting breast sucking as a remedy or preventative measure for breast cancer. “Doctors recommend that women reduce the risk of breast cancer, by having their breasts sucked. In a BBC news publication, it was reported that regular sucking of the breast lowers the risk of cancer. The breasts must be sucked as often as possible, to help women fight breast cancer. Please Suck and Save a Life Today.- Cancer Research.” Dubawa set out to uncover if breast suckling among partners and mother to child can prevent the development of breast cancer. We found that although a lot has been written on the level of truth of this claim, many continue to circulate and believe the veracity of the claim. Dubawa spoke to Dr. Bismark Dwobeng, a medical doctor at Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital (Radiation Oncologist), who attested to having heard this claim. He said that as an oncologist, however, he does not believe that there is any truth in claim. “What we know about the breast being sucked is for babies because there is evidence for mothers who are able to breastfeed their children having reduced risks. Even in this case, we cannot say necessarily that it prevents breast cancer. What we can say is that the risks are reduced for women who breastfeed.”  Dr Dwobeng added that even though the claim is untrue, some truth may be in the assertion  in terms of detection of breast cancer. “In Ghana, most women present with breast cancer at late stages. So the little truth is that maybe, just maybe, if someone has access to your breast frequently, then there will be a higher chance that any changes to the breast may be identified. Someone seeing the breast can tell if there has been a change in look or weight or size. In that case, partners can contribute to diagnosing breast cancer early rather than the late cases that we have been recording,” Dr Dwobeng said. In tracing the source of the claim, we found that most of the publications which reported that breast sucking by a partner can  prevent or reduce risks of developing breast cancer according to a BBC report. These publications have been in existence for years with some going as far back as 2010, 2013, 2014 and as recent as 2020 in relation to the  claim in question.  After rigorous search on the BBC website, scanning through over 20 pages of content on breast cancer related reports, our search revealed a 2002 article on BBC titled “Extra breastfeeding prevents cancer.” Excerpts of the report state that “Thousands of women might be spared the agony of breast cancer if they extended the period for which they suckle their babies.” The article does not make mention of adult suckling of the breast preventing breast cancer development. It does, however, add that extended breastfeeding could remedy breast cancer development in breastfeeding women.  Dubawa has also reached out to BBC to find out if they have ever published a report claiming that breast sucking by partners can reduce chances of developing breast cancer. According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), breastfeeding lowers risks of developing breast cancer in mothers.  Dubawa also came across articles that clear the air on the claim of breast sucking and breast cancer prevention. In October 2018, Ghanaweb published an article that indicated that men sucking on breasts will not prevent breast cancer development. The study cited Dr. Naa Adorkor Ayeetey who was then a Senior Resident Doctor at the Radiotherapy Department of the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital. According to the video embedded in the report, it is a fallacy to think that sucking on the breasts of partners will reduce the risk of breast cancer. “There is a single truth. Breastfeeding a baby will reduce your risk of getting cancer. Breastfeeding a man on the other hand will not reduce the risk but it will not increase your risk either. The reason is that when you are breastfeeding a baby, you produce a certain hormone that reduces the estrogen in your blood and so you are protected. When breastfeeding a man, that does not happen and so you are not protected.” Having your partner suck on your breasts will not prevent or reduce chances of developing breast cancer. However, it may help identify changes in the breast, prompting further tests to ascertain if one has breast cancer.

Claim: Governor Chief Nyesom Wike claims that Rivers State has never allocated less than 30 percent of its budget to education,"Claim: Governor Chief Nyesom Wike claims that Rivers State has never allocated less than 30 percent of its budget to education Governor Wike’s claims to have never given less than 30% of budget allocation to education in Rivers State is untrue. Immanent data from the Rivers State government on the state’s  budget contradicts the governor’s words. Hence this claim is false.  Basic education is a right guaranteed by Nigerian laws. The 1999 constitution states that education is free of cost for all citizens. That is also backed up by the Compulsory, Free Universal Basic Education Act of 2004. Popularly called the UBE Act, it empowers state governments to develop basic education policy and strategy while local governments ensure service delivery and management. The Federal Government is responsible for setting national standards and maintaining regulations on them. What is regarded as basic education in the law is the first six years of primary school education and the three years of Junior Secondary School education, all spanning at least nine years.  However,  as some Nigerian governors appear to vie for the scrapping of the funding system, Chief Nyesom Wike, the Rivers State governor, while trying to dissociate himself from those calling for the scrapping of the counterpart funding system for basic education in the country, was quoted to have stated that “In this state, we have never given education less than 30 percent of our budget. Education and health are key. So, the federal government should try as much as they can to see that more funding is given to education.” According to a press statement issued by Kelvin Ebiri, the Special Assistant to the governor on media, governor Wike was said to have made the statement when the Minister of State for Education, Hon Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba, paid him a courtesy visit at Government House, Port Harcourt recently.  Political office holders are accountable to the people and the accuracy of their statements is also as important as the role they play. Therefore, DUBAWA opts to verify the accuracy of Wike’s statements.  DUBAWA first reached out to Kelvin Ebiri, the Special Assistant to the governor via a phone call over the efficacy of the report. He confirmed that the report was indeed issued by him and it presents the governor’s statements when he received the minister of  State for education in Port Harcourt:  “In this state, we have never given education less than 30 percent of our budget.”  Dubawa went through the state’s 2020 budget appropriation law presented on the official website of the Rivers State government. The budget’s speech and summaries contradicted Wike’s claims, it clearly stated that “Building on the progress of the last four and half years, we will continue to ensure adequate funding for education in Rivers State. It is for this reason that we are proposing the sum of N49.471 billion to fund the education sector for 2020. This sum represents 20% of the total budget and is the highest ever budgetary allocation to education, reflecting the level of our commitment to investing in the future of our children.” Dubawa went further to calculate the percentage of the acclaimed 49.471 Billion as 20% of the budget allocated to education in Rivers State in 2020. Results show that it was miscalculated, in fact, out of the 2020 total proposed budget of N530,813,357,619.00 (five hundred and thirty billion, eight hundred and thirteen million, three hundred and fifty-seven thousand, six hundred and nineteen naira) of Rivers state, the 49.471 billion naira only represented 9% of the entire budget and not 20% as  claimed  in the state’s  2020 budget outline.   Also, the 2021 Rivers State approved budget totaled at four hundred and forty-eight billion,  six hundred and sixty million, seven hundred and seven-three thousand, four hundred and seventy-six naira (N448,660,773,476)  allocated thirty-billion, four hundred and sixty-six million, two hundred and one thousand Naira (N30,466,201,000.00)   to education which represents just 6.7% of the 2021 total budget. These findings reveal a total contradiction to Governor Wike’s claims of never allocating anything less than 30% to education. In fact, all the data extracted from the Rivers State’s government website, as outlined above, shows the highest attempt as stated by the state government was 20% which was even miscalculated. Governor Wike’s claims to have never given less than 30% of budget allocation to education in Rivers State is untrue. Data from the Rivers State government on budget contradicts the governor’s words; hence, this claim is false.

Claim:  A viral information on social media and other blogs claims that Elon Musk said: “Nigerian ladies are the best” and vows to marry one.,"Elon Musk is a South Africa-born American entrepreneur who is the co-founder of the electronic-payment firm, PayPal, the chief executive officer of SpaceX, and the electric car manufacturer, Tesla. Elon’s popularity significantly increased earlier this year when he was announced as the world’s richest man.  Since this announcement, multiple narratives combining truth, propaganda, and sensationalism have erupted around and about Elon. One of such recent narratives is the viral claim-making rounds on the internet and social media that Elon Musk said, amongst many other things, that “Nigerian ladies are the best.”  The information was shared multiple times on WhatsApp as a CNN Breaking News frame embedded with Elon Musk’s photo.  However, Dubawa traced the image to a blog post where it was first shared with a detailed report about it. The blog post, headlined as “Elon Musk vows to marry a Nigerian girl as he starts hunting for one” suggested that “Billionaire tech entrepreneur and owner of Tesla Motors, Elon Musk, has said he is seriously looking into marrying a lady from Nigeria. Elon revealed this during a live television interview with CNN.”  The report provided further details about what appears to be Elon’s long attraction to Nigerian ladies.  The same narrative also reappeared on another Nigerian-based blog where it was stated that “Elon Musk vows to marry a Nigerian girl as he starts hunting for one”  Gradnlineupdates Blogpost: Elon Musk vows to marry a Nigerian girl as he starts hunting The same information was shared on the ‘Kwaku Blogger’ page where it attracted multiple users’ reactions on Facebook. In the same vein,  Jackson Marvelous, another facebook user who shared the same claim on his timeline generated several comments. One user, Isoyah Seth, commented that “COME I HAVE GOOD SISTERS DAT CAN GV U WAT U WANT.” Another commenter, Mayo Orgi, who showed an interest in the news, added, “I want to add him to d number of husband’s I will have.” However,  another user, Okwudiri Isioma Deborah, seems to question the post, “Let me start from asking you, where you heard this?”  In a reference  to a  CNN interview, the claim seems to be the most believable amongst most commenters.  Rising skepticism around the claim poses questions around the veracity of the claim: Did Elon musk actually make such a statement and did CNN actually interview him about it?  DUBAWA first reached out to CNN via mail over the veracity of the claim. In response, CNN confirmed that the information was false and there was no such interview. The brief response clarified that “No, this information is false. No such interview.”  Furthermore, when DUBAWA carried out an analysis on the photo frame linked to CNN, results uncovered  traced  it to an Android application called “breakyourownnews,”  where such frames can be conjured to suit any narrative of choice. Also notable, was the fact that none of the blogs mentioned when the interview took place or even provided a link to it. Also, the information was neither reported on major news outlets including CNN.   The information in circulation, that Elon Musks has said “Nigerian ladies are the best” and intends to marry one is false.

"Claim: He claimed that brands that create adverts abroad but broadcast them on international and local radio and TV stations broadcasting in Nigeria will be fined N100,000 each time such adverts are ran; and any Nigerian company that invests in a foreign football league, must invest at least 30% of same funds in Nigerian football. The minister claimed that these provisions are contained in the amended 6th Nigeria Broadcasting Code.","Claim One Claim: He claimed that brands that create adverts abroad but broadcast them on international and local radio and TV stations broadcasting in Nigeria will be fined N100,000 each time such adverts are ran; and any Nigerian company that invests in a foreign football league, must invest at least 30% of same funds in Nigerian football. The minister claimed that these provisions are contained in the amended 6th Nigeria Broadcasting Code. While some of his claims are largely true, the claim by Lai Mohammed that the amended Nigeria Broadcasting Code states that brands that create adverts abroad but broadcast them on international and local radio and TV stations broadcasting in Nigeria are liable to a fine of N100,000 each time such adverts are run, is FALSE. FULL TEXT: The Nigerian Minister of Information, Lai Mohammed, recently said that brands that produce adverts abroad would pay a fine of N100,000 (One hundred thousand naira) each time the adverts are run on local radio and television stations, as well as international stations broadcasting in Nigeria. Mr. Mohammed who said this on Monday 29th March 2021, as a guest on the Good Morning Nigeria show of the Nigerian Television Authority (NTA), claimed this fine was prescribed by the Amended 6th Nigerian Broadcasting Commission (NBC) Code 2020. The Nigeria Broadcasting Code prescribes the standard of the contents and quality of materials for broadcast in Nigeria. The amendment to the 6th edition of the Nigeria Broadcasting Code was unveiled on Tuesday 4th August 2020, in Lagos by the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC), the apex regulator of broadcasting in Nigeria. The revised code aims at increasing local content, generating advertising revenue, and preventing anti-competitive practices in the Nigerian broadcast industry. The minister said that adverts promoting Nigerian brands must be directed and produced by Nigerians inside the country. “What is common today is to see products made in Nigeria but the adverts for those products are actually probably done in South Africa or in the US. So, we amended the code to say that if a product you want to advertise in Nigeria territory is made in Nigeria, grown in Nigeria or processed in Nigeria, then you must make sure that the advert is also produced in Nigeria,” he said. “Gulder is made, processed in Nigeria. If you go to South Africa to produce an advert which you are going to air to Nigerians because Nigerians consume Gulder, what we have amended the code to say is that for every time that advert is aired in Nigeria either on radio or television, you pay a fine of N100,000. We are not stopping you from making your production in America or South Africa but if you are going to advertise in Nigerian territory, you will pay a fine of N100,000. “In other words, if Gulder makes an advert in South Africa and it is shown on NTA, if it shows it 10 times a day, it will pay N100,000 fine 10 times. If you do an advert in South Africa, you put it on CNN and we look at that advert and we see that the advert was not made in Nigeria but actually made in South Africa, or you see that five times a day it is on CNN, you pay half a million (naira) to us. Half a million will go to the Content Development Fund.” VERIFICATION: To verify these claims, Dubawa assessed the Amended 6th National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) Code 2020. According to Section 7.8.2 of the amended 6th Nigerian Broadcasting Code, the broadcaster: The Amended Code prescribes for the exclusive production of all radio and television advertisements by Nigerians and within Nigeria. It also prohibits the transmission of adverts produced by foreign companies in Nigeria. While the code states that a breach of this provisions “shall incur a penalty and such sums shall be invested into the Local Content Development Fund”, it did not expressly state N100,000 as penalty nor any particular sum of money. Neither did it state that the penalty would apply each time the adverts are aired, contrary to the Information Minster’s claims. Conclusion on Claim One: While it is true that the amended 6th Nigerian broadcasting code prohibits the production of advertisements by foreign companies outside Nigeria, for transmission on local and international television and radio stations operating in Nigeria, however, the claims by Lai Mohammed that brands that produce adverts abroad would pay a fine of N100,000 (One hundred thousand naira) each time the adverts are run on local and international radio and television stations in Nigeria is FALSE, as the broadcasting code does not spell out the sum of N100,000 or any particular money as fine. Claim: The Nigerian Minister of Culture and Information, Lai Mohammed, claimed that Nigerian brands, like Guinness which run adverts during foreign matches must compulsorily advertise during Nigerian Premier Football League games. Mr. Mohammed also stated that if any Nigerian company invests in a foreign league, the firm must invest at least 30% of that money in Nigerian football, a claim he said is in line with provisions of the amended 6th Nigeria Broadcasting Code. According to the amended 6th Nigeria Broadcasting Code, no Nigerian brand shall advertise its products and services during the broadcast of a foreign sports league unless that brand equally advertises such products and services during the broadcast of the Nigerian local sports league. The code also confirms that Nigerian companies that invest in a foreign sports league must invest 30% of the same investment in the Nigerian sports league. FULL TEXT: As part of recent claims by the Minister of Culture and Information, Lai Mohammed, he claimed that Nigerian brands like Guinness which run adverts during foreign matches must compulsorily advertise during Nigerian Premier Football League games. “Let’s assume you have brought in La Liga, and during the matches, Guinness is advertised, we will compel you, we will compel Guinness to also advertise when we are playing a local league. That is the only way we can grow this industry but as can be expected, we have had very few supporters,” the minister said. “We went further to say that if a company should invest $1m in bringing EPL to Nigeria, that company must also be ready to spend 30% of that $1m in producing local content along the same line. “In other words, if Maltina or Guinness decides to bring in EPL, which is English football, we have no problem with that. But they must also invest in covering our local league to the tune of 30 percent of what he has paid.” He argued that this was the only way to help the local league thrive, adding that until the anti-competitive and monopolistic tendencies are expunged from the broadcast sector, Nigeria would not be able to grow local content. Verification: According to Section 6.2.10 of the amended 6th Nigeria Broadcasting Code: “No prime foreign sports content shall be transmitted in the Nigerian territory unless the owner of such content has also acquired prime local sports content of the same category with a minimum of 30% of the cost of acquiring the prime sports content.” Also, Section 6.2.11 states that: “Advertisement of products and services during prime foreign sports contents shall not be broadcast unless the advertiser equally sponsors, and or advertises such products and services in the broadcast of prime local sports contents in the same category, where such local sports contents produced in Nigeria are available.”  Conclusion on claim two It is true that Nigerian companies that invest in any foreign football league must invest 30% of the said investment in the Nigerian football league, according to the amended 6th Nigerian broadcasting code. The code also states that companies that advertise their products and services during foreign sports contents must equally advertise the same during Nigerian local sports contents.

"Claim: A press statement circulating on social media claims that the President of the United States of America, Joe Biden, has signed an Executive Order directing the issuance of American work electronic visa (e-visa) and residence permits to interested Nigerians.","Shortly after he was sworn in as the 46th US President of the United States of America, Joe Biden signed 15 executive orders including one which rescinded an immigration ban by his predecessor, Donald Trump. Reports say over 41,000 people were denied visas after Trump imposed travel restrictions on thirteen (13) countries, including Nigeria – banned in February 2020. Hopes of moving to the US were dashed for many Nigerians, as the ban denied them access to any type of visa that could grant them permanent immigration or residency. On Saturday 3rd of April, 2021, Dubawa spotted a viral WhatsApp message sharing a press release purportedly issued by the US Citizenship and Immigration Services, claiming that the US President, Joe Biden, had signed an Executive Order approving the issuance of electronic work visas and residence permits to Nigerians. The press statement reads in part: “President Joe Biden, the 46th U.S President has signed an Executive Order that interested citizens of Nigeria who measure in some special professions are eligible for American Work E-Visa and Residence Permit. This was communicated to the Nigerian Mission in the United States by the U.S Department of Immigration. “The terms of the Executive Order allow (sic) 25,000 citizens of the Federal Republic of Nigeria between the age (sic) of 25 to 55 whose expertise are among the following: 1. Health Workers 2. Engineers, 3. Marine Workers, 4 Civil Servants, 5. Business Administrators, 6. Accountants, 7. Lecturers, 8. Special Skills Workers.” The statement directed applicants to send documents including passport biodata page, curriculum vitae and a passport photograph, to the “Consular Section via e-mail to [email protected]”. It also states that successful applicants are required to make a “deposit of $250 for English Proficiency Test”, in addition to another “deposit of $150 for COVID-19 Screening before departure to the United States of America and upon arrival”. Declaring 30th of April, 2021 as the deadline for submission of applications, the document instructed that “applicants must go about their applications themselves without involving any third parties such as travel agents, family members living in the United States, or any other delegates.” In a bid to ascertain the authenticity of the claims, Dubawa accessed the official website of the U.S Citizenship and Immigration Services and finding shows that there was no Executive Order by President Biden granting e-work visa or resident permits to Nigerians, as claimed by the document in circulation; neither was there any press release announcing such.  Also, a web search query initiated by Dubawa returned no evidence that the US President issued such an order. Dubawa discovered that the press statement in circulation is filled with errors in English; and could not have emanated from the US Citizenship and Immigration Services or its parent-agency, the US Department of Homeland Security. An assessment of the email address ([email protected]) listed in the press release as belonging to the USCIS, showed it is fake and not linked to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services nor any other US agency, because US government agencies use the “.gov” domain suffixes for their official websites. Dubawa looked up the identity of the website (www.americaimmigration.us) on WhoIs Domain Search and discovered that it was registered by an individual with the name “John Fixed”, amongst other details. Similarly, another press release bearing similarity with the one in circulation on WhatsApp was also found on Facebook. An assessment of both documents showed discrepancies, as the press releases purportedly signed by the USCIS Director, presented different signatures and dates. Moreover, the United States Diplomatic Mission in Nigeria recently dissociated itself from the press statement. In a statement posted on its verified Twitter account (@USinNigeria), the US Mission described the press statement as fake, “an old scam, but in fresh packaging.” “Fraud Alert! Scammers and fraudsters are circulating a fake “press release” claiming to offer a new type of work visa to Nigerian citizens aged 40-55.  It’s the same old scam, but in fresh packaging – don’t become a victim,” the tweet read. The press statement in circulation with claims declaring the issuance of e-work and resident permits for Nigerians on the directives of US President Joe Biden is FAKE. Findings by Dubawa indicate that the US President did not sign any executive order granting the issuance of e-work visa and residence permits to 25,000 Nigerians, nor was any press release issued by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services in that regard. While it is true that President Biden issued some Executive Orders upon assumption of office, it is important to note that none of them contains the claims made by the press release in circulation.

The claim that Abdulrasheed Bawa, the new EFCC boss has directed INEC not to sell forms to any aspirant who has a file with the agency is false. No sufficient evidence backed the information and EFCC has distanced itself from the information.   Full text The Economic and Financial Crime Commission (EFCC) has been a predominant agency fighting against financial corruption  mostly perpetrated by political officeholders in Nigeria. While the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) is the agency saddled with the responsibility for conducting elections and  vetting political aspirants. It is on the basis of the relationship these two agencies share, that a user on    Twitter (@idowu553) claimed that Abdulrasheed Bawa has directed INEC not to sell forms to any aspirant who has a file with the agency. With almost 550 reactions and over 250 retweets attributed to the claim, (@adinoyi12) one of the almost 120 commenters argued that: “Fake news….Section 36 subsection(5) of the Constitution of Nigeria, 1999 amended provides that every person who is charged with a criminal offence shall be presumed to be innocent until he/she is proved guilty by competent court of jurisdiction” Another user  (@omoniyen) Added that “This may be fake news. Is there any judiciary  department at efcc? cos Nuhu Ribadu  did  same in 2007. All amounted to nothing and vacated by a court of competent jurisdiction.” Regardless of the prevailing views around the claim, DUBAWA seeks to uncover the reality of the information.  DUBAWA first  reached out to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission through its head of Media and Publicity, Wilson Uwujaren, via phone call, he simply clarified that the report was false.  He said that “the Chairman, Abdulrasheed Bawa, has not directed or advised the Independent National Electoral Commission against selling forms to persons with a file with the agency who are aspiring to contest in 2023 general elections”. He further stressed that “the EFCC chairman neither met with INEC officials nor made any pronouncement related to the election since he was appointed. “Even more, the claimant  has failed to provide the source of the information or state exactly where and when the EFCC chairman made the statement.  Even as newsworthy as the information appears to be,  no relevant media has  reported on it or even made suggestions around it.  Also, according to the Section 31(1)(6) of Electoral Act 2010 as amended,  INEC cannot refuse to accept a party’s list submitted within the stipulated time neither can it disqualify any candidate. The law stipulates that only a court of law can disqualify a candidate, not EFCC.  The claim that Abdulrasheed Bawa, the new EFCC boss has directed INEC not to sell forms to any aspirant who has a file with the agency is false. There is no available evidence that points to the validity of the information.

Claim: Femi Adesina claims 30million Nigerians were unemployed in 2015 before Buhari came into power.,"The Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, claims 30million Nigerians were unemployed in 2015. Mr Adesina made this claim while featuring on Channel TV’s programme Sunday Politics on March 28, 2021. Our verification started by viewing the 52 minutes 42 seconds clip on Channels Television Tv) YouTube page. Mr Adesina said that in 2015, the unemployment figure used for campaign by the All Progressives Congress was 30 million. He said this while reacting to the question on the unemployment rate and his government’s promise to create jobs. “Buildup of the 2015 election, when APC was campaigning, the figure that was used by the then-candidate Buhari, was that a minimum of 30 million were out of jobs, were unemployed particularly youth and that his government was going to do something about that. As of 2014/2015 the figure used for the campaign was 30 million unemployed Nigerians, it’s on record.” Dubawa conducted a keyword search on Nigeria’s unemployment rate in 2015 and this led to some reports. A report by Macrotrends shows a trend analysis of unemployment in Nigeria from 1991 to 2021. According to this, the unemployment rate for 2015 stood at 4.31%. Screenshot of Macrotrend graph and table. Data by Statista show in the first quarter of 2015, the unemployment rate in Nigeria stood at 7.54%, in the second quarter, 8.19%, in the third quarter, 9.9% and in the fourth quarter- 10.44% of the working-age population(age 15-64). The unemployment rate is calculated as a percentage of the number of unemployed persons in the labour force i.e. Unemployment Rate = 100 × Unemployed Population/ Labor Force Population A report by ProShare showed that unemployment in the first quarter(Q1) of 2015 rose to 7.5%. According to ProShare, this means that 17.7 million people between ages 15‐65 were either unemployed or underemployed in the labour force. In Q1 2015, the labour force population increased to 73.4 million from 72.9million in Q4 2014, representing an increase in the labour force by 0.69%.    This means 504,596 economically active persons within 15‐64 entered the labour force. Within the same period, the total number in full employment increased by 0.88%, while the number of underemployed declined by 6.46% resulting in a reduction in the underemployment rate to 16.6% (12.2mn) from 17.9% (13.1mn) in Q4 2014.   The number of unemployed in the labour force, on the other hand, increased by 861,110 persons or 18.43% between Q4 2014 and Q1 2015 resulting in an increase in the unemployment rate to 7.5% in Q1 2015 from 6.4% in Q4 2015.  Accordingly, there were a total of 17.7 million people between ages 15‐65 either unemployed or underemployed in the labour force in Q1 2015. Dubawa tried finding unemployment statistics through the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) for the year 2015 but figures for that year were not accessible. The available data was from 2017- 2018. Available statistics show in the first quarter of 2015 which was the last quarter before president Buhari came on board in May, 17.7 million Nigerians were unemployed with the unemployment rate at 7.5%. This makes the claim that 30 million Nigerians were unemployed to be false. ",million,01/04/2021,https://dubawa.org/femi-adesinas-claim-30-million-nigerians-were-unemployed-in-2015-false/
"CLAIM: A WhatsApp Message claims UBA and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) are giving out a 500,000 Naira grant.","As a result of the coronavirus pandemic, many countries, including Nigeria, were forced to enforce the ‘stay home order’ which in a way contributed to the increase of fake news. As the lockdown became effective, Dubawa quickly shifted from fact checking claims relating to cure, spread, and who had tested positive to the virus to news of  COVID-19 relief grants . The relief grants are presented as a kind of support supposedly given to citizens by the government to help sustain them through the lock down till normalcy was returned. In the interim, misinformation started circulating on social media, especially WhatsApp, informing people to register for varied amounts of money; from 5000 to 30000. Now, over a year after Nigeria had its first case of Covid-19, grants-related claims have become prevalent. On Wednesday 3rd of March, Dubawa received a circulating WhatsApp Message which conveys a testimony of a grant beneficiary.  A beneficiary claimed he had just gotten a grant from the United Bank for Africa (UBA) in collaboration with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). He further enjoined readers to apply through an attached link. This WhatsApp Broadcast, unlike others of its kind, strikes differently as it comes in form of a testimony of a beneficiary which is likely to have more influence on readers.  A click on the link attached to the post takes readers to a website ( Student Gist ) where the publisher explains what the grant is about and how to apply for it. The website stated that the Federal Ministry of Youth and Sports Development has started issuing out the application forms for an alleged N75billion Nigeria Youth Investment Fund. In the bid to ascertain the veracity of the claim, Dubawa identified a major red flag; an inconsistency between the Message shared on WhatsApp and the information on the website it directs readers to, thereby, producing two claims.  The WhatsApp Message announces a N500,000 grant by UBA and CBN while on the second website, the focus is on an alleged N75billion Nigeria Youth Investment Fund (NYIF) from the Ministry of Youth and Sports and the CBN. Although the website’s About Us page provided no result, its homepage shows it gives updates on ‘latest jobs in Nigeria.’ Dubawa analyzed the website, using the ScamDoc tool. While it has a 76% trust score, the tool advised that more investigations be carried out on the website.  Dubawa also found that on the 22nd of July, 2020, the Federal Executive Council approved the sum of N75, 000,000,000.00 (seventy five billion naira) for the establishment of the Nigeria Youth Investment Fund for the period of 2020 – 2023. The investment plan which is an initiative of the Federal Ministry of Youth and Sports Development (FMYSD) aims to create 500,000 jobs, to curtail the issue of unemployment amongst the youth, and improve access to finance for youth and youth-owned enterprises for national development. The plan targets young people between the ages of 18-35 years.  Dubawa, on the CBN website found a pop-up, redirecting to the actual website where interested youth can register for the fund.  Further, calls were made to the Ministry, where Mr John Joshua Akanji who is the minister’s Special Adviser (Media) acknowledged the existence of the N75 Billion NYIF and told Dubawa he is unaware of any website besides the ministry’s. In his word, “I don’t know about any website, the only authentic website I know is the ministry’s website.” Therefore, while it is true that there is an existing fund from the Ministry of Sports and Youth Development, the website sharing the information and asking people to register through its platform is fake. Hence, the information is False. In most cases, it is impossible to trace forwarded information on WhatsApp to its original source, but for this particular claim about the alleged 500,000 grant from the Central Bank of Nigeria and the United Bank for Africa, Dubawa identified that it is a product of Student Gist. Dubawa found that after registering  for NYIF through the imposter site, applicants would be asked to share the ‘opportunity’ with 15 groups or 15 friends on WhatsApp. Dubawa shared the link to its personal WhatsApp for a test run and the process produced the same texts as it is in the viral claim. On going back to the site, it identified that this researcher had only shared once as a message popped up on the screen to remind the user that his  application is only successful after sharing to 15 groups or 15 friends. In essence, this experiment shows how fake news purveyors fraudulently lead people to spread misinformation and drive traffic to their websites. Nonetheless, Dubawa directed calls, a text and a WhatsApp message to CBN and UBA but none were attended to. This researcher, however, visited UBA’s Aminu Kano Crescent branch in Abuja. There, Mr Mathew A, the Customer Service Manager told Dubawa he’s unaware of any N500,000 grant and suggested the viral message may be fraudulent.  Findings show that while the National Youth Investment Funds exists, there’s no alternative link for application order than the one provided by the Ministry of Sports and Youth Development. It is also important to note that there is no N500,000 grant anywhere from UBA, the WhatsApp Message is a product of a fraudulent website seeking attention through spreading fake news, rendering its claims FALSE and MISLEADING.

"Claim: A report from the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), picked by some media outlets,  claims the Controller General of Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) said the service has not recruited in the last 17years.","A news report titled “We can’t effectively police the borders with 15,000 officers” was Tweeted by The Cable, an online newspaper, with the caption that Hameed Ali, the Controller-General (CG) of Customs, said the service has not recruited in the past 17 years. “On recruitment into the NCS, the CG said the service had not recruited in the past 17 years, adding that recruitment into the service was the prerogative of the president.” Dubawa followed the link to the full story on Cable’s website to get more details. The report which noted this was an agency report from the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) was published on March 5, 2021.  According to the NAN report, the CG made this claim at the presentation of the service’s 2021 budget, before the house committee on customs service, while noting the need for NCS to recruit officers as there is a gap in terms of officers currently in the service. Dubawa conducted a keyword search which led to another report by the Guardian published on March 4, 2021, which quoted the CG as saying Nigeria’s border is extensive and porous. The story also has the claim that the service has not recruited in the past 17 years. Dubawa visited the NCS website to find more information but did not get any information on recruitment. However, Dubawa got the email address of the information unit of the service ([email protected]) which we emailed to inquire about the claim but no response has been received so far.  Dubawa went ahead to speak with the National Public Relations Officer, Joseph Attah, who said this claim is not true. Acknowledging there was a time the service had a recruitment gap, Mr Attah noted this was before Mr Ali’s regime as CG. The new controller general came on board in 2015 which means he has just spent  6 years in office which is far less than the number of years the report claimed recruitment has not been attempted in the service. “I am particularly surprised that this question is coming at a time we just rounded up our recruitment screening exercise across the country. It was held in Abuja, Kano, Owerri, Lagos and Bauchi.  Yes, there was time recruitment was not done but that was long, even before his regime anyway so that gap is identified and that is what efforts are on to address them.”  Also, in 2019, the NCS in a statement by the Secretary, Nigerian Customs Board, announced it was set to recruit 3,200 personnel to fill positions in the agency. In 2021, reports by MyJobMag, RecruitmentGate, and Careersng, show an ongoing recruitment exercise by the service across the North West, North East, North Central, South East, South West and South-South. Although the PRO did not give specific dates of this recruitment which he said took place last week, the reports above show this was between March 1 to March 10, 2021. Speaking on the issues of shortage of officials which the CG said makes it hard to police the border appropriately, the PRO said it is not just the need for manpower but the need for technology. “The issue of policing the borders goes beyond the number of persons. Yes, manpower is an issue but working tools and as you these days you need more than human beings to police the border. Technology is invoked now in policing the international border. What 100 people can do, 5 or 10 people can do with very effective technology. Yes we understand that we need more manpower no doubt about that, we also need technology and that is what the government has addressed, the government just approved E-Customs which is end-end automation of the customs processes and procedures. Meaning that going forward, there will be non-intrusive equipment installed at all our entry points to help customs police the borders better.” When asked what the current staff strength of the service was, he said it was around 15,000 but this will change after this recruitment. “Currently we are in the region of 15,000 plus. But don’t forget recruitment is going on now so, in the next one month, the figure I have given you will not be correct”. The Nigerian Customs Service has denied not recruiting in the last 17 years, noting the recruitment gap that existed was long before Hameed Ali’s regime which is just six years old.

"Claim: A Twitter user, DEMAGOGUE PhD (@von_Bismack), posted a tweet claiming that the Nigerian government has cancelled the admission and training of female cadets at the Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA).","On March 16, 2021, DEMAGOGUE PhD (@von_Bismack), a twitter user posted a tweet declaring that the Nigerian government has cancelled the admission and training of female cadets at the Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA). The post reads “This Government cancelled female cadets from NDA and our Feminists kept mute. If the topic is abt (sic) food, they all will rise like soaked garri but will go mute when their vileness is needed most.” Within 48 hours, the tweet had garnered 297 retweets, 37 quote tweets and 577 likes. Dubawa conducted a keyword search on the admission process and eligibility of female cadets at the Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA). Dubawa also studied the lists of successful candidates for admission into the NDA, since it began admission of female cadets in 2011 and discovered that the Academy has been admitting female cadets every year. Findings by Dubawa show that the Nigerian Defence Academy began the admission of female cadets in 2011, following a directive by the then President, Goodluck Jonathan GCFR. The first set of female cadets, nicknamed Jonathan Queens, numbering 20, were admitted into the 63rd Regular Combatant Course (63RC) of the NDA in September 2011, alongside 155 male cadets. In October 2016, 19 female cadets of the 63RC graduated and were commissioned as officers in the Nigerian Armed Forces by President Muhammadu Buhari. Eligibility requirements for admission into the Nigerian Defence Academy as listed on the institution’s official website, indicate that candidates eligible for admission into the institution “must be single male or female without legal obligation to support any child or other individuals”. It also states that candidates “must NOT be less than 1.68 metres tall for male and 1.65 metres for female,” also noting that “admission into the Academy is for both male and female Nigerians only”. The guidelines also indicate that the “NDA has an annual cadets’ intake of 175 for the RC (regular course). This comprises 155 males and 20 females”. An assessment of the list of successful candidates for admission into the NDA since 2011, when the admission female cadets began shows that the female cadets have been admitted into the NDA every year, since its 63rd Regular Course in 2011. The then Defence Spokesperson (now Coordinator, Defence Media Operations), John Enenche, had also debunked reports about the stoppage of training female cadets at the Nigerian Defence Academy. Mr. Enenche, an Army Major General, described the report as “disinformation to the general public by mischievous individuals”. “The contents of all those publications are ill-intended concoctions, not authentic and should therefore be disregarded outrightly”. He noted that female cadets are “eligible for all the types of commission that are grantable to their male counterparts”, as provided by the terms and conditions of service of the Nigerian Armed Forces, which he said “has not changed”. The claim that the Federal Government had cancelled the admission or training of female cadets at the Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA) is FALSE. Findings have revealed that since it started admitting female cadets in September 2011, the NDA has NEVER stopped the admission and training of female cadets, neither has there been any directives by the Federal Government for its cancellation.

Claim: Several social media posts and screenshots have been seen circulating with the Claim that American Rapper Kanye West is the Richest Black Man in the United States.,"Claim: Several social media posts and screenshots have been seen circulating with the Claim that American Rapper Kanye West is the Richest Black Man in the United States. The claim that Rapper cum Entrepreneur Kanye West is reportedly the richest black man in the United States is Not True. Viral posts were seen across Social Media platforms in Sierra Leone and beyond with a photo of popular American Rapper Kanye Omari West with claims stating that the Rapper is the richest black person in the United States with an estimated net worth of $6 Billion. This claim, reported by multiple entertainment outlets like Complex, estimate that West’s Sneaker brand Yeezy as well as Yeezy Gap – a clothing deal, have a combined value of as much as 4.7 Billion.   This has been shared widely ever since on WhatsApp statuses and Instagram, without detailed information on the claim offered to the public. Several people are now using his situation to offer motivational notes to readers as Kanye West was faced with issues of huge debt a few years ago. This was before his deal with Adidas which stabilized his financial situation that was mired in debts accounting for millions of dollars. These claims were however ignited by the Bloomberg post which headlined “GAP has billion-dollar ambitions for Yeezy Deal with Kanye West. It is no secret that Rapper Kanye West overcame his debt crisis and accumulated huge wealth on his  YEEZY sneaker deal with Adidas which is estimated by FORBES  to be worth around 1.7 Billion Dollars. However, all these accumulated wealth ranging from his Yeezy, Cash and other Assets, his music catalogue and Skims which happens to be a co-owned company with soon-to-be ex-wife Kim Kardashian did not bring him any way closer to the purported $6 Billion net worth circulating on social media. Forbes also maintains  it is less than a third of the purported net worth. Below is a rundown of his net worth as analyzed by Forbes:  Still the crown jewel of his fortune, sales at West’s sneaker brand, which has a 10-year long production deal with Adidas, climbed to $1.7 billion last year, up from $1.3 billion in 2019. As a result, West earned $191 million in royalties last year. It’s an impressive growth. While UBS predicts the brand will reach over $3 billion in sales by 2026, and valued it accordingly, we went with 2020 numbers: The operating income of Yeezy, which is owned 100% by West, was $214 million in 2020. With a 9x multiple and 20% private company discount, Forbes calculates that the Yeezy business with Adidas is worth $1.5 billion, about $250 million more than it was a year ago.  Thanks to the millions he’s made from Yeezy and his music, West has accumulated a nice-sized pile of cash, as well as homes and toys. He owns more than $100 million in real estate—including multiple ranches in Wyoming and homes in the Los Angeles area. According to a balance sheet sent over by his team, there’s also $9.3 million worth of artwork, $7.6 million worth of jewelry, $5 million worth of vehicles, $3.4 million worth of furniture and $1 million worth of livestock. Along the way, he has also racked up a significant amount of debt: $56 million. We couldn’t track down every horse, chair and necklace, so again applied a discount to the numbers provided. We also didn’t include any value for the website Yeezy Supply, which West’s camp claims is worth $1.5 billion. Forbes counts its value via royalties of the Yeezy shoe sales made through the site in the Adidas deal.  While he may make most of his money as a fashion mogul, West started out as one of the world’s most popular rappers, and his catalogue of songs still brings in millions in royalties each year. Just like with Yeezy, he could cash out on that royalty stream, as musicians from Shakira to Bob Dylan have in the last year.  West and his soon-to-be ex-wife Kim Kardashian West, may have ended their marital relationship, but they maintain certain business ties. West has a small stake in his ex’s shapewear and loungewear company Skims, which has grown during the Covid-19 pandemic.” The purported $6bn network was an estimation done by Bloomberg in relation to his Yeezy and Gap deal which is worth about 1.5 Billion. The clothing deal has a huge potential of doubling the rapper’s net worth but it is yet to make a single sale as it is not formally operational. Forbes therefore refuses to give it any value until the product starts to sell. Forbes  in its most recent analyses of the claim states that: “The report that the celebrity is worth nearly $7Bn are based on magical thinking around sales that don’t yet exist. This is why he is currently worth less than one-third of that.” The UBS report which Bloomberg referenced made assumptions based on future earnings thus the bank document did not confirm the estimation but stated them as future earnings that may result from the Yeezy Gap deal. With the claim of Rapper Kanye West topping the list of richest black people in the United States circulating on social media space in Sierra Leone, Dubawa  decided to do a quick fact-check on the claim which has proven to be untrue. American based business magazine Forbes; owned by the Forbes Family and its globally recognized platform publish reports on a variety of issues but mostly connected to wealth and fortunes. Forbes maintained that the richest black man in the United States remains to be the Vista Equity Software Mogul Robert F. Smith who is worth around $6 billion. Dubawa through the analysis of Forbes and other thorough investigations on the issue from Dubawa, confirmed that Kanye West is not the Richest black person in the United States as claimed.

CLAIM: a Twitter user (@SDiaso) shared a picture claiming that an Assistant Commissioner of Police was arrested for kidnapping.,"On March 12, 2021, a Twitter user, Soludo Diaso (@SDiaso) shared a post with a picture purported to be an Assistant Commissioner of Police arrested for kidnapping. It had the caption “Assistant Commissioner of @Police NG arrested for kidnapping in Nigeria.” As at Tuesday March 16, 2021, the Twitter post had generated 4,954 Retweets, 758 Quote Tweets and 6,520 Likes. To verify this photo, Dubawa initiated a Google reverse image search. Results from the search indicate that the picture had been on the internet since 2019. A report from the results identified the man in the picture as Kinglsey Udoyen, who was arrested by the police in Akwa Ibom State in January 2019, for impersonation. Mr. Udoyen was arrested by the police for defrauding members of the public by pretending to be an Assistant Commissioner of Police in Akwa Ibom State. He was paraded before journalists at the Akwa Ibom State Police Headquarters in Uyo, by the then Commissioner of Police, Musa Kimo. Mr. Kimo said Mr Udoyen, who resides at House 3, Stadium Road, Abak, was arrested on January 2, 2019, for “using the fake police rank to threaten and defraud unsuspecting members of the public. “A search in his house led to the recovery of one English pistol without magazine and ammunition, portraits of chief superintendent of police and assistant commissioner of police, three pairs of uniform, police belt, fake police ID card, and other documents,” the police commissioner said. According to a press statement by Frank Mba, the Force Public Relations Officer, the suspect, Kingsley Udoyen, “is a fake Police Officer and not a serving Assistant Commissioner of Police.” “The suspect is an impersonator who was posing as an Assistant Commissioner of Police to defraud and threaten unsuspecting members of the public before he ran out of luck and was subsequently arrested. He has since been arraigned in a competent court of law and he is currently undergoing criminal prosecution at the Magistrate Court, Abak, Akwa Ibom State,” the police spokesperson said.

Claim: A photo purported to be a CNN live bulletin claims that hospitals are on lockdown as first vaccinated COVID-19 patients have started eating other patients.,"Following the roll out of COVID-19 vaccination by a number of countries including Ghana to help reduce the transmission of COVID-19, a photo of what appears to be a surgical ward with blood spills is circulating on social media in Ghana and elsewhere with an accompanying allegation that hospitals are on lockdown as the first vaccinated COVID-19 patients have started eating other patients. This photo is purported to be from a CNN live broadcast.  The photo shared by a Ghanaian-based Twitter user, who humorously added that by June we will start fighting zombies, is shown below: Through a Google Reverse Search, Dubawa uncovered that the photo was originally shared by New York times on February 14th, 2019, before the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The actual narrative around the photo tells the tragic shooting of a teenager who later died at the emergency department of Temple University Teaching hospital after efforts to resuscitate him failed.  The image was hence, a depiction of the emergency room the teenager died in.  Though the claimant took nothing out of the photo, it was observed that there was, however, a deliberate effort to alter the image quality so it can perfectly fit into the purported narrative.  Thus, when Dubawa analysed the claimant’s version of the photo on Forensically, results show massive noise proliferation on the image. It was deliberately filtered to be blurry and cloudy so that it can  fit into the fabricated CNN frame.  Image 1 shows the result of analysis carried out on the claimant’s purported image.  Assessed on the noise amplitude level of 55% and the Opacity level 0.54%, findings reveal the blurry and hazy shade of noise added to the photo as rather traced in image 2 below.  Image 2 shows the results of analysis carried out on the original image. Also assessed on the noise amplitude level of 55% and the Opacity level 0.54%, findings reveal a level of clarity and transparency as compared to image 1.  A closer look at image one and two reveals the obvious differences between the two pictures. Even more, other multiple images are taken out of context; and their quality altered just to be forced into another different narrative, such as in this case, to mislead unsuspecting members of the public.  Additionally, there is no identified report online of CNN making such claims of a hospital’s lockdown because of alleged first vaccinated COVID-19 patients starting to eat other patients. Rather, what was found, was an application that facilitated such misleading content. The application, Media Photo Frames;  Breaking News App Photo Editor, allows for users of the application to fabricate any story as breaking news to be attributed to the available media frames.  Furthermore, the claim making rounds on Ghanaian social media space was found to have also circulated on other platforms across the world in December last year. This has consequently been debunked by several fact-checking platforms such as Times of India,  India Today, and AFP already.  The photo purporting that first vaccinated COVID-19 patients have started to eat other patients is false. The photo first circulated before the pandemic and is originally from a report in February 2019 showing an emergency department of Temple University Teaching hospital’s attempts to resuscitate a shot teenager. CNN has made no such reports of hospitals on lockdown due to COVID-19 vaccine patients eating other patients .

The user makes unique dialling initiated by (*) followed by a unique code, thus entering a menu of services offered by the company (in this case, the bank).The USSD code can be used for airtime top-ups, checking your bank balance as well as mini statement deliveries, etc. A Twitter user Agboola Peter (@baba_Omoloro) in a Twitter thread gave out codes to deactivate your USSD profile for different banks. According to him, you can deactivate your USSD profile from any phone if you lose yours. “If you lost your phone, you can deactivate your USSD profile to your BANK ACCOUNT by calling the below codes from ANY PHONE.” Excerpt of Twitter Thread. Comments under this thread accepted while some questioned how these codes work.  A Twitter user Fedrick Odunsami (@FedrickOdunsami) in the comment section noted that this is an emergency code and every bank has one. “Just type your bank USSD code * 911#. It’s called the emergency code. Every bank has it”  Excerpt of Fredrick’s comment. Tosin (@UncleTosin) enquired how the codes can be used when you lose your phone number connected with the account.  “How do you use those codes because you’ll lose the sum with the phone. Abi the sim will come and meet you to use the codes ni?” Excerpt of Tosin’s comment. In the same thread, Agoola Peter inserted a post from July 2020 on SIM lock. He explained how to secure your sim against sim card theft and the different default pin for the different network services. As of Monday, March 8, 2021, this tweet had generated 372 retweets, 7 quote tweets, and 573 likes. “Use PIN on your SIM to prevent SIM CARD THEFT.  WHY? To save your account balance when your phone is stolen.  HOW? Quick Search “SIM Lock” and click on “Set SIM Lock”, then follow instructions.  The default PIN for 9mobile & GLO is 0000 while AIRTEL is 1111 MTN is 00000″ Excerpt of the Twitter post on Sim lock Dubawa reached out to all the banks mentioned on Twitter and the customer service staff of some of these banks. Out of the 12 banks mentioned in the tweet which we reached out to, 8 (United Bank for Africa, Sterling, Keystone, Zenith, Fidelity, Wema, Access, and Guaranty Trust Bank (GTB)) responded to our enquiry while 4 (First Bank, First City Monument Bank (FCMB), Union Bank, and Heritage bank) did not reply. Access Bank’s reply did not however address our enquiry. According to GTB this is true as it gave *737*51*74# as its code for restricting or stopping unauthorised access  or debits. “If you require urgent assistance for a lost/ stolen card and stopping unauthorized access to your account, use the options below: + Card Hotlist (Block): *737*51*10# + Restrict your account or stop unauthorized access/ debits: *737*51*74#.” Excerpt of GTB’s reply. Fidelity Bank also confirmed the code (*770*911#) as the correct code for deactivating USSD. “Apologies for the delayed response. With regards to your enquiry kindly dial *770*911*phone number# to deactivate USSD.” Wema Bank also confirmed *945*9111# as it’s code.  “The code is *945*911#” the bank replied  Keystone Bank described the code which it confirmed to be true as their panic code “Our panic code is *7111*9111. The panic code allows you to restrict your account when any emergency arises. Furthermore, the code can be dialed on any phone number.”  Zenith Bank confirmed the code (*966*911#) as its code for restricting your account if you feel it has been compromised. “You can dial *966*911# to restrict your account if your account is compromised, phone stolen, divulge details to third parties.” A customer service officer of Zenith, Glory Omale,  also confirmed this code was correct, noting it is for emergencies and can be done from anybody’s phone. “Just dial *966*911#. The next prompt is for you to put the account number you want to restrict. Next prompt is to put the alert number of that account. It is for emergencies that is why you can use any phone.” Sterling Bank also confirmed this code to be true. “the code is *822*911#” the bank said. UBA gave a different code from that contained in the Twitter thread. To block your card or freeze your UBA account, the code to dial is *919*9# or  *919*10# ” You can block your card and freeze your account yourself, you can simply dial *919*10# and *919*9# from your registered mobile number.” A customer service officer of UBA, Bankole Adelusi, added that this emergency code originates from the bank’s  transfer code which is *919#. While 6 out of the seven banks that replied confirmed the codes shared to be true, UBA Bank disapproved the code given for its bank. Dubawa also tried the code shared for UBA on Twitter and noted it led to an airtime recharge prop.  To verify the second claim on SIM lock, Dubawa researched SIM lock and how it works. SIM lock is simply Subscriber Identity Module lock. This is a function in GSM cell phones that restrict the phone’s use to a particular cellular carrier identified by a SIM card. SIM lock protects your SIM and the data on it. SIM lock requires your lock screen PIN, pattern, password, or fingerprint and SIM card to be in place before the phone can be unlocked. You can kind of think of it as physical two-factor authentication.  To set up SIM lock,  First you’ll need to know your carrier’s default unlock code (for many, this is just 1111 but if this is not it, contact your carrier to get the default code). You must, however, be sure of what the correct code is because if you enter an incorrect code three times, it will render your SIM useless. Secondly, and this should really go without saying, but if your carrier doesn’t use a SIM card, then SIM Lock won’t work (and probably isn’t even available on your handset). To set up SIM lock, go to the Settings menu, find the button “SIM lock” if it’s available on your phone, click on it. After this, “Set up SIM card lock” will show up at the top of the list, click that and tap on the “Lock SIM card” box. This will automatically prompt for the SIM PIN and show how many attempts you have left. Once you enter the correct pin, SIM Lock will be activated and you can change the default pin to any pin of your choice. Once the SIM lock is activated, whenever you restart your smartphone or swap the SIM to another smartphone, you will be required to enter your SIM PIN. Without this pin, the SIM card will not be accessible, thus protecting any bank details associated with that phone. The claim on using emergency codes to block or deactivate your account is mostly true as all the banks that replied except UBA confirmed the codes to be correct. Also it is true that SIM lock protects every data on your SIM including your bank details as it makes the SIM inaccessible without the pin.

A user on Twitter claims that armed robbers tied up the staff of a certain filling station in Nigeria and sold off fuel for 3 hours.,"No doubt, the Nigerian newspaper space has been grazed with multiple phenomenal headlines that are both catchy and sensational at the same time. Nonetheless,  this reality has with time,  raised little questions as regards reported matters that seem uncanny and doubtful at the same time. Typically in this case, where a Twitter user, (@EjayOfLagos) shared a  picture of a certain newspaper headline that read “armed robbers tie-up staff, sell fuel for 3 hours”. The user captioned the tweet as  “breaking news” then followed with the statement “this country na cruise” a prominent statement used by Nigerians to sometimes describe their despondency with the turn of events in the country. The tweet garnered 1,500 retweets,     over 3,000 reactions, and 140 comments from diverse users with various views. One user (@ayinde_uba) challenged the claimant, commented that “it is not in Nigeria stop dey cap for retweets”  another user (@OverfeDamola) consented that this “can only be in Nigeria” while another user, (@horpeyemi) lamented that “we are just full of funny stories”.  Even though citizens have the right to know whatever is happening around them, claims as such can demoralize their trust. It is as regards this reality that DUBAWA ventures to verify the validity of this claim.  DUBAWA first noticed that the price at the filling station  was  indicated Dollar sign, which is usually uncommon with  Nigerian filling stations.  DUBAWA uncovered that though the incident actually took place, it occurred in Zimbabwe, Amakhosi Service Station along the Bulawayo-Victoria Falls Road, and not in Nigeria as implied by the claimant. The report about the robbery was by different media houses in Zimbabwe, Zambia, and other African countries. The Zambian Observer outlined the same headline as that of the claimant and at Iharere.com where the same news was reported to have happened in Zimbabwe. On Chronicles.co.zw the same story was also reported in detail along the same line with the others.  Also, the claimant neither gave further details or a link to the story but rather smartly created a narrative around the situation to link it to Nigeria.  The  claim that  armed robbers tied up the staff of a certain filling station purported to be from Nigeria and sold off fuel for 3 hours is a  narrative designed to mislead people into thinking that it happened in Nigeria. This claim is false.  ",false,10/03/2021,https://dubawa.org/incident-where-armed-robbers-tie-up-staff-sell-fuel-for-3-hours-occurred-in-zimbabwe-not-nigeria/
Claim: A viral WhatsApp post entitled “Below is the purported kite being flown by the Federal Government – Nigerian Economic Restructuring Bill 2021” outlines that Nigeria will be made up of 42 states with seven per each of her constituent geo-political zone.,"A viral WhatsApp post which has been forwarded/shared many times as indicated by the instant messaging application, entitled “Below is the purported kite being flown by the Federal Government – Nigerian Economic Restructuring Bill 2021”, claims that Nigeria will be made up of 42 states with seven per each of her constituent geo-political zone. The post which bears the author as ‘Ayo Akinfe’ on his website, said: [1] Nigeria will be made up of 42 states, with seven per each of her constituent geo-political zone. These shall be: The post which has also been shared on other social media platforms, like Facebook and Twitter, has generated mixed reactions.  Many have debated and deliberated over the post but yet there is nothing as such.  Meanwhile, one @shawnfendi on Twitter shared the post and it had over 100 engagements. Also, @JustSociety4all with over 13,000 followers, shared the post on her timeline.  According to afrobarometer.org, Nigeria is a federation of 36 states and 1 Federal Capital Territory. Each of the 36 states is a semi-autonomous political unit that shares powers with the Federal Government as enumerated under the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. From 1960 to 1966, Nigeria operated on the basis of Northern region, Western region, Eastern region, and the Mid-Western region. The creation of states began in 1967 with General Yakubu Gowon coming to power via a coup d’état. He dissolved the regions and created twelve states out of them. In verifying the authenticity of the post, our correspondent searched through the internet to find a traceable background link to the post, but no credible media outlet has reported any news about the purported bill. A twitter account owned by Ayo Akinfe (@AyoAkinfe), where the story was shared after it was posted on its website, created more clarification about the post.  While responding to enquiries from our correspondent via his Twitter Direct message, on the purported bill which bears his name, he said, it was “Just a proposal from me.”  Akinfe who authored the piece said he writes 10-point columns every day on his website.  However, the London-based journalist said “Ignore all those wayo people attributing it to the government.”  Dubawa also reached out to the Senior Special Assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu. In Garba’s reaction, he described the report as ‘unknown’ and asked that the presidency be left out of it since it was not a draft bill from the presidency.  The trending piece which has been attributed to the federal government is FALSE.  The author, Ayo Akinfe, clarified to Dubawa that he wrote the piece as a proposal in his column; hence, the ‘Nigerian Economic Restructuring Bill 2021’ is not a purported kite being flown by the Federal Government as widely circulated on WhatsApp and other social media platforms.

Claim: a user on Twitter shared  a collage photo he claims to be Marcus Rashford before he purportedly left Nigeria and what he looks like at present.,"Claim: a user on Twitter shared  a collage photo he claims to be Marcus Rashford before he purportedly left Nigeria and what he looks like at present. Photo used to depict Marcus Rashford was doctored to suit the narrative. This claim is false.  Full text Multiple trends on Twitter have perhaps come and gone. However, one current trend making waves in the Nigerian Twitter space is the multiple photo collages shared by users to depict how they looked before they left Nigeria to other advanced countries.   Many users have shared what they apparently looked like before leaving the country. The collage usually carries two pictures, one illustrates “how I left” while the other depicts “me now” it was in this atmosphere that Twitter user with the username Marcus Rasford MBE (@one_dash) shared a collage photo of what claimed to be Marcus Rashford before and after he left Nigeria.  One of the photos depicted Marcus Rashford seemingly barbecuing while the other photo showed him in his Manchester United kit. The reality that Marcus Rashford is a prominent soccer player for Manchester United and the claimant’s username ‘Marcus Rasford’ attracted multiple users to the post.  The post stimulated 6,200 retweets, 40,000 reactions, and over 549 diverse comments. One user, Cole(@mr_18) shared his view with a sense of consensus to the photo, he held that “..And now you are our best player…..U make me inspired” while some users argued that the photo was a fake depiction of the player. (@kingkennyx20) “social media is a place for lies. I don’t believe anything here”.  Trends on social media can have a terrible influence on members of the public if it lacks the basis for truth. DUBAWA looks into this claim to verify its veracity.  When DUBAWA ran an analysis on the Twitter handle, it turned out that it was a parody Twitter account parading as Marcus Rashford.  While the user’s Twitter handle remains constant, the username keeps changing to suit the claimant’s narratives. Image 2 shows the claimant’s username changed again to “BENUEGIANT” Furthermore,  the first picture used to depict Marcus Rashford’s barbecuing was uncovered by DUBAWA to have been photoshopped to depict the claimant’s narrative. Even more, the same photo has been used to ridicule prominent persons.  In 2017, the same photo was doctored in a certain website to depict Kanye West.  Kanye West depicted in the same photo under scrutiny Also, Bruno Mars, an American Pop singer was equally depicted in the same photo in another different website in 2020.  So also Bruno Mars, an American pop singer  Apparently, this photo has been doctored several times to depict different persons; in this case Marcus Rashford. This is not the first time Marcus Rashford was depicted with the same picture. In 2019 last year he was trolled with the same picture after missing a penalty kick. The photo  depicted as Marcus Rashford was doctored to suit the prevailing narrative. The image has been used multiple times to ridicule prominent persons. This claim is false.

Claim: Facebook post inferred that Picture of cows eating tomatoes was taken in Nigeria.,"Over the past few days, there’s been a growing conversation around the blockade of food supplies from the North to the Southern part of Nigeria. This decision by the Amalgamated Union of Foodstuff and Cattle Dealers of Nigeria (AUFCDN) is reportedly a protest of the alleged killing of its members in other states.  In the middle of this social media conversation, on Thursday, 4th of March, a Facebook User, Iyalaje Omotosho, posted an image of a heap of tomatoes on the ground as a number of cows fed on them. This image with over 40 comments and 21 shares has been used to suggest a downside of the AUFCDN’s decision. While some, in the comment section, inferred that the wasting tomatoes are part of the foodstuffs held back by the AUFCDN,  others believed the picture was not taken in Nigeria. To identify the origin of the image, Dubawa ran a quick check on the image through google reverse image technology. According to the reverse search, this image has been in circulation since 2017(July, September) and at the time was trending outside Nigeria as the caption attached to the image in each post was not written in any known Nigerian language. However, GoogleTranslate identified the language as Hindi. In 2019, the same image was found on a website, accompanying a short write up on the plight of Sindh farmers. The image has also been used in January 2020, as seen here and here, under the hashtag ‘#StopImportTomatoAndOnion’ on Twitter. The hashtag harbours tweets from people of Sindhi protesting their government’s policy which encourages the importation of tomatoes and onions. From the findings of this research, it is safe to say the Image has nothing to do with the current situation in Nigeria; it’s just another picture taken out of context.

Claim: A Twitter post claims women in Nigeria cannot adopt a child without the guarantee or approval of a male person.,"Adoption is a form of alternative care whereby a person legally assumes the role of a parent in respect of a person who is not their biological child.  Adoption is a way of providing security, permanency and the love of family for a child who cannot be raised by his/her birth parents or within the birth family or has none. After adoption, all rights and responsibilities are transferred from the original parents to the adoptive parents. The child assumes the surname of the new parents, receives an adoption certificate to replace their birth certificate, and becomes a permanent and full member of the new family. On February 15, 2021, A Twitter post by Pamela Adie (@pamelaadie) claims women cannot adopt a child without the guarantee/approval of a male person that has the same surname as the woman. This Twitter post as at Monday, February 22, 2021, had generated 2,297 Retweets, 158 Quote Tweets and 3,838 likes. Dubawa conducted a keyword search on adoption and the process of adoption in Nigeria. Dubawa also studied different documents on adoption in Nigeria. In Nigeria, adoption is done under statutory law or customary law but the rules regulating it differ from state to state. Adoption procedures can be open or closed; a closed adoption is one in which the natural and adoptive families have no knowledge of or contact with the adoptive family while an open adoption, is one in which the birth family and the adoptive family have direct contact with each other.  The first adoption legislation in Nigeria was enacted in the then Eastern Nigeria in 1965 and was known as the Eastern Nigeria Adoption Law, 1965. This law now applies in Anambra, Imo, Ebonyi, Abia, Rivers and Bayelsa State. In 1968 an adoption law was promulgated for Lagos State. Some states have followed suit in making their own laws while others are yet to.  No state in the Northern part of Nigeria has any legislation on adoption.  The Child’s Rights Act 2003 enacted by the National Assembly sets out the rights and responsibilities of a child in Nigeria and provides for a system of child justice administration and the care and supervision of a child, among other things. However, because the rights and welfare of children, in general, are matters within the legislative competence of the States under the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999, the Act is enforceable only in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja. According to part XII (12) of the Child’s Right Act, anyone can apply for adoption to the Court but with varying conditions for the married and unmarried.  For a married couple, each of them must have attained the age of twenty‐five years (25), and there must be an order authorising them jointly to adopt a child. Where it is just one party in the marriage, that party must have obtained the consent of his/her spouse, as required under section 132 of the Act.  Requirements for the married include provision of marriage certificate or a sworn declaration of marriage, the birth certificate or sworn declaration of age of each applicant, two passport photographs of each applicant,  a medical certificate of the fitness of the applicant from a Government hospital and any other document requested by the Court. For the unmarried, the person must have attained the age of thirty‐five (35), and the child to be adopted must be of the same sex as the person adopting. For both married and unmarried, the adopter or adopters must be found suitable to adopt the child in question by the appropriate investigating officers.   Generally, it is those children who are abandoned, neglected or persistently abused or ill-treated who are in need of adoption. Some of these babies are born by drug addicts or other types of disabled mothers.  Usually, only a juvenile under the age of eighteen years who is not or has not been married can be adopted. In Nigeria the Statutes on adoption make provisions for juveniles to be adopted but the term “juvenile” has no uniform definition for some states it is 18and  below and others it is 17 and below. For instance, In Edo and Delta states a juvenile is one who is eighteen years and below, while in states like Lagos, Anambra, Imo and Ogun, a juvenile is one who is under the age of 17. According to the Child’s Rights Act, the Court will only grant an adoption order in respect of a child with no surviving parent, whose guardian consents to the adoption, or  in respect of an abandoned, neglected or persistently abused or ill-treated child, and where there are compelling reasons in the interest of the child why he/she should be given up for adoption.    Birth certificate: Birth certificate or sworn declaration of age of the applicant or each of the applicants as the case may be. Marriage certificate :Where the applicant is a married couple, their marriage certificate or sworn declaration of marriage. Two passport photographs of the applicants or each of the applicants, as the case may be. A medical certificate of fitness of the applicant or each of the applicants from a government hospital. Evidence that the applicant(s) are citizen(s) of Nigeria (international passport or national ID card will suffice). A child rights activist, Elizabeth Achimugu, explained to us in a telephone interview that there is no where in the law that a woman cannot adopt without a man’s approval. She believes if there is difficulty faced by single women trying to adopt, then it is most likely a moral issue not an issue of law. “It is not in the law that a woman cannot adopt in the law but there is an age for it. A single lady not adopting isn’t the law but I guess it’s for the purpose of societal expectations, the fear that when the single lady gets married, her husband may reject the child” She also added that section 42(1) of the 1999 Constitution as amended expressly prohibits discrimination based on sex and the Constitution is superior to any other law enforced in Nigeria On the adoption form of the (FCT), the following is required: name of adopter, date of birth, nationality, occupation, marital status (Married, Single, Divorced, Widowed, and Separated), religion, highest education level, the purpose for adoption, details of the child, address of the adopter etc. Adoption in Nigeria is not restricted to any gender or based on marital status as the law makes provision for both genders either married or not married.

Claim: Twitter post claims the vagina is acidic and has a pH between  3.8 to 4.5,"A Twitter post by Vagina Museum (@vagina_museum) claims the vagina is acidic and this is what causes lighter patches on dark underwears. The post claims the pH of the vagina is between 3.8 to 4.5. As of Monday, February 22, 2021, the post had generated 33,000 Retweets, 6,345 Quote Tweets and over 95,000 likes. “Do you find lighter patches in your dark underwear? IT’S NORMAL! Your vagina is acidic and has a pH of 3.8-4.5. That’s acidic enough to bleach fabric, and that’s what’s happening.” According to Healthline, a normal vaginal is moderately acidic with pH level between 3.8 and 4.5.  What constitutes a “normal” pH level can, however, vary slightly based on your stage of life; during your reproductive years (ages 15 to 49), the vaginal pH should be below or equal to 4.5 but before menstruation and after menopause, a healthy pH tends to be higher than 4.5. Another report by medical news today agrees that a normal vaginal pH is less than 4.5. It also notes that the lower the number, the more acidic the vaginal environment will be. Factors like unprotected sex, antibiotics, douching (washing the vagina), and menstrual periods can affect the pH level of the vagina. A high vaginal pH level (above 4.5) provides the perfect environment for unhealthy bacteria to grow. An acidic vagina usually doesn’t cause disease but if the acidity rises too much, it might reduce fertility. Dubawa reached out to people to share their experience but this was difficult as most people were uncomfortable speaking about the topic. However, a young lady (age 23) who shared her experience but pleaded anonymity said she experienced these patches when was a little girl but not anymore. She noted the vagina is self-cleaning and its fluid is capable of causing this.  But she explained that she does not experience this as an adult  because she does not wear her underwear for long anymore and she uses pant liners. Speaking to a Gynaecologist, Dr Jerry Agim, he confirmed the vagina PH to be correct and that the level varies based on the different stages of life. For women, he explained that Oestrogen is a factor. It is responsible for the production of glycogen by the vaginal epithelial cell which is acted upon by the bacteria called lactobacilli to produce lactic acid which maintains the Vaginal PH at 4 to 4.5 A midwife, Grace Odoma, who also spoke to Dubawa said “the vagina fluid has high acidity and is capable of causing any stain on any material. Yes, the type of material also matters and how long the underwear is used. This lighter patch is not a problem but a good sign the person is healthy and has a normal floral or good activity in the vagina. So those light patches you are seeing is a result of the high acidity of the vaginal fluid. While some will not notice this is because they change their pants regularly or the type of material in use does not show the effect of the fluid or because they use pant liners. Another health expert attributed lighter patches to the acidic nature of the vagina and washing. While it is true that the vagina has a PH level of between 3.8 and 4.5 which is strong and capable of changing the appearance of materials, this cannot be categorically linked to the lighter patches on the underwear because it is not proven and there are other factors that may influence the patches like the type of material, the period of use and washing.

Claim: A certain news report claims Israel has invented an inhaler that can cure COVID-19  within just five (5) days.,"When the novel COVID-19 virus slipped off the borders of China and made its way to almost all parts of the world spitting fire and taking lives alongside, one thing that became crucial was the demand for a cure. A vaccine that will remedy the ravaging virus and curtail its spread.  Subsequently, the breakthrough was attained, a vaccine was developed and plans on how to partition it into nations became the next discourse.  Pfizer, the American-based pharmaceutical company that has also developed a vaccine has been putting up efforts to produce vaccines that will meet up the surging demands. Courtesy of Pfizer’s early success in creating a vaccine, Israel, was reported last month in January to have sprinted ahead and struck a deal with Pfizer to secure doses in exchange for medical data. The agreement was officially attained and on February 11th, after the Pfizer COVID-19 was delivered the Times of Israel reported that an Israeli healthcare provider that has vaccinated half a million people with both doses of the Pfizer vaccine has attested that no one has died afterward.  Nonetheless, not too long after this avalanche of events has unfolded, a certain news site (Worldtopnewsng.com) claimed that Israel has invented an inhaler that can cure COVID-19 in just 5 days. The claim and the information it purports reappeared again on a Facebook page and was further featured on another news site with the exact details. The alleged news report of the COVID-19 cure further noted that “In Israel, professor Nadri Aber has invented a miracle inhaler which can cure COVID-19 in just five days. His inhaler has an efficacy of 96 percent, with 29 of the 30 patients who tried it at the Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Centre recovering rapidly from the virus and leaving the hospital between three and five days. Only one inhalation was enough to fight off the virus, even with more serious cases. Nadir himself described it as an “unprecedented invention” after seeing the results.“It is an innovative device based on exosomes enriched in CD24 that can be inhaled directly into the lungs”.  As more researchers are still searching to find out a more potent remedy for the Coronavirus, this information, if reliable, will create fresh hopes for curing the virus. However, if it’s untrue, it has the ability to mislead people and even lure people into perceiving inhalers as cures for COVID-19. It is in the light of such  reality that DUBAWA delves into unearthing the certainty of the claim.  First off, DUBAWA confirmed the existence of the drug in question. Termed as EXO-CD24 inhaler treatment, the drug was developed by Prof Nadir Arber at the Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center (Ichilov Hospital), where it was tested on 30 patients with moderate-to-severe condition, all of whom recovered 29 within just 3-5 days. It is administered through inhalation, once a day, in a procedure that takes only a few minutes, for five days. The EXO-CD24 is not a COVID-19 cure itself but rather a treatment that will boost the immune system and help COVID-19 patients to regain consciousness.   This information was verified by   Dr. Shiran Shapira, Head of Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical center, and Dr. Arber’s director of the laboratory who has studied the CD24 protein for decades. She explained this in a video interview where she was being questioned as regards the EXO-CD24 inhaler treatment. Dr. Shapira explained that the treatment “is based on an exosome that the body is releasing from the cell membrane and used for intercellular communication. So we enrich the exosome with the 24CD protein, which is known to play an important role in regulating the immune system. This helps to prevent the deterioration of the patient.” As regards the drug being a COVID-19 cure, she explained that “the drug moderates severe conditions and our intervention is in order to prevent the deterioration of the patient, the need for ventilation and even death. If someone is already under ventilators, it will be too late for treatment. So it is not a cure but a treatment to alleviate the patient’s condition.”  She added that, “our goal is not to target the virus itself but to treat the immune system.” As regards the availability of the medicine, she explained that the medicine is only in its phase one trial but will subsequently be subjected to phase two and then three. Furthermore, an examination of Dr. Shapira’s interview shows that the claimant’s news report lacks details and was scant in its presentation of the matter.     DUBAWA has also reached out to Dr. Shiran Shapira for more details about the medicine and her response will be updated as soon as it’s received.   EXO-CD24 inhaler is not an apex cure for COVID-19. However, it is a treatment that helps to boost the immune system of a  COVID-19 patient and alleviate the condition. Hence, the report that Israel has invented an inhaler that cures COVID-19 in days is rather exaggerated and misleading.

The claim that the Dangote Foundation is offering cash prizes as empowerment grants to members of the public via certain links is false. The group has confirmed that the information is a scam.  Dangote Group is one of the leading providers of essential needs in Food and Shelter in Sub-Saharan Africa. The group is into cement Manufacturing, Sugar Milling, Sugar Refining, Port Operations, Packaging Material Production, and Salt Refining. While Aliko Dangote, the richest man in Africa is the founder and president/chief executive of the Dangote Group. The Group currently has a presence in 17 African countries and runs a foundation. The Dangote Foundation is dedicated to adding value to people’s lives across Africa through facilitating health initiatives, education, and empowerment initiatives. However, recently, a web-based message making rounds on WhatsApp claims that the Dangote Group, through its foundation is offering cash prizes as empowerment grants to members of the public via a link it offered. The message has been shared several times by WhatsApp users, especially on groups beckoning users to click and register.  When clicked on, the user is welcomed with an opening statement that states:  “The Dangote Foundation is dedicated to adding value to people’s lives across Africa by facilitating health, education, and empowerment initiatives, Proceed Now To Apply By Filling The Provided Form and Choose Your Preffered Payment Method, Your Account Will Be Credited As Soon As Possible.👇👇👇.” The link also demands the user’s full name and phone number from a background photo that portrays supposed members of the Dangote foundation standing in front of the foundation’s insignia.   The same page offers the terms, policy statements, and a link for the user to ‘Apply’ for the said funds. After the user has clicked on the ‘apply’ link, a page is presented with the picture of the Minister for Humanitarian Affairs, Sadiya Umar Farouq, apparently handing out money to some persons with the heading “Federal Government support grants”. Furthermore, the page also requires the user to respond to certain queries; employment status, and reasons for seeking the grants.  Afterward, the user is redirected to a page that demands a user to share a link to a certain number of groups of WhatsApp before receiving the said grant. This is not the first time a viral claim such as this is attributed to Dangote. In July 2020, a viral WhatsApp message claimed that Aliko Dangote was giving out 15,000 Naira weekly allowance to Nigerian youths as COVID-19 relief fund. However, after some probing, DUBAWA confirmed the information to be a hoax.  Hence, it is because of this prior knowledge that this claim is also subjected to scrutiny, to confirm its validity.  DUBAWA first reached out to the Dangote Group over the validity of the website and the message it’s propagating. Hauwa Mohammed Bello, from the communications unit of the Dangote Group, confirmed that the information was false and that the website is a scam. She stated that “this is false and a scam, there is nothing as such.”  Furthermore, the website in question turned out to be a malvertizing site, forcefully redirecting users to another site for betting. Even more, the website kept swinging between the ‘Dangote foundation’ and the ‘federal government grant’. It implied that the grant was orchestrated by the Dangote Group (private sector) but kept showing ‘federal government grant’ on almost every page. Furthermore, an analysis of the website on ScamDoc (a web tool that evaluates reliability of “digital identities” {email address or website} and provides answers to questions frequently asked by Internet users such as: How to check if a website is reliable or not and how to detect fraudulent emails) reveals that the domain name is very recent (less than 6 months) with a link is to one or more countries known for being used by fraudulent websites similar to websites DUBAWA had analyzed in the past. Fake websites are built to pursue their ruse and fraudulent intentions.  The website in question aims to maladvertize to illegally generate traffic to another site, further the Dangote Foundation has confirmed that the organization is not offering any such grants at the moment. This claim is false.  ",scam,17/02/2021,https://dubawa.org/dangote-not-offering-empowerment-grants-as-claimed-by-fraudulent-website/
Claim: PDP claims Nigeria is disqualified by WHO from the list of nations to receive the COVID-19 vaccine.,"The novel COVID-19 pandemic  came with an overpowering novelty that even advanced nations were overwhelmed by its pressing flanks. Even experts in virology seemed to have flunked out of ideas at the early stage of the pandemic. However, so much improvement  was  subsequently made especially  in discovering precautionary ways to curtail the spread of the virus and the development of a vaccine.  This improvement, primarily as regards the actualization of a COVID-19 vaccine, has within the past months steered multiple news reports on how countries will acquire  the COVID-19 vaccine. In January 2021,  Governor Kayode Fayemi, head of the Nigeria Governors’ Forum, said “Nigeria is among 12 countries in Africa that have indicated the readiness of the 92 qualified countries for the facility and will by the end of February 2021 receive its first shipment of vaccines,” Fayemi said.  However, a recent claim seems to dispute Mr. Fayemi’s assertions. On Twitter, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), a strong opposition party to the ruling party, All Progressives Congress (APC), claims Nigeria is disqualified by WHO from the list of nations to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. The claimants affirmed that the incidence was due to  the inability of President Buhari’s administration to provide a simple storage facility for the vaccine.  The claim was tweeted as a thread alongside a version of the same tweet in   a press statement copy.  The outlined message in the press release  and the tweet boils down to the acclaimed failure of the present government to provide a COVID-19 storage facility. However, Yusuf Yunusa(@yyunusa) inquired that  “Who is the handler of these fake news spreaders?” While also implying that the information is false. DUBAWA examined multiple information about  COVID-19 vaccines that both had an element of truth and lie. However, one thing that is  apparent is the ability of such information to garner people’s attention and if false, easily mislead them. This situation encouraged DUBAWA to uncover the truth in this information.  DUBAWA reached out to Kate Ribet, Communications Officer COVID-19 Vaccine Rollout, WHO Regional Office for Africa who replied via an email. On the question of WHO’s disqualification of Nigeria for the COVID-19 vaccine, she clarified that “WHO  has not disqualified any country in Africa from accessing COVID-19 vaccines through the COVAX facility, but rather the organisation is supporting all countries to access vaccines as quickly as possible. Currently, all countries on the continent are expected to start accessing the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccines by the end of February. The vaccine is under review by WHO for Emergency Use Listing and the outcome is expected soon. Of the 88 million AstraZeneca doses allocated to African countries for the first phase, Nigeria has received by far the largest allocation, with 16 million doses.” “In addition to the Astra Zeneca doses, there is an initial limited volume of Pfizer vaccine available through COVAX. Demand for the initial allocation of 1.2 million Pfizer doses was exceptionally high. COVAX received interest from 72 countries around the world, of which 51 countries were considered by the review committee as “ready” (Nigeria was among these countries) and 18 countries in total were finally chosen to receive initial Pfizer doses. On the Africa continent, as of the 18 January deadline, COVAX received 13 submissions, of which 9 were recommended as ready to deploy the Pfizer vaccine and the list includes Nigeria. “Unfortunately, it was not feasible to provide each of these 51 countries with Pfizer doses, due to a number of factors including the limited capacity for Pfizer to handle many countries at once. Therefore, spreading the limited doses across all the 51 countries deemed ‘ready’ could not have achieved the intended public health benefit.  After epidemiological self-financing to account, the decision was taken to proportionally balance the number of self-financing and AMC Participants, as well as Participants across all 6 WHO regions.” Her response indicates that Nigeria is not disqualified from countries that will receive the COVID-19 vaccine and in fact, the country is only waiting for its turn.  The information provided by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) that Nigeria is disqualified by WHO from receiving the COVID-19 vaccine is not true. The World Health Organization’s communications officer confirmed the information as false.

Claim: A certain web-based message claims that the Federal Government has approved Individual NIN registration online to avoid the unnecessary crowd in NIMC centers.,"Claim: A certain web-based message claims that the Federal Government has approved Individual NIN registration online to avoid the unnecessary crowd in NIMC centers. The information circulating on WhatsApp that the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) is now carrying out registration online via a certain link is false. The website is found to be fraudulent and untrustworthy, mostly used to boost page views by redirecting users fraudulently. The National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) operates and regulates matters of national identity in Nigeria with services covering National Identification Number (NIN) enrolment and issuance, National e-ID card issuance, identity verification as well as data harmonization and authentication.  While NIN is The National Identification Number (NIN) is a set of numbers assigned to individuals in Nigeria to identify them as bonafide citizens.  Since the government announced the compulsory linkage of NIN numbers to mobile SIM cards, NIN registration centers have been witnessing a massive turnout of people who are yet to register. It is perhaps because of this preponderant situation in NIMC registration centers that a certain web-based message claims that the Federal Government has approved Individual NIN registration online to avoid the unnecessary crowd in  NIMC centers.  The web-based message provides a link for users to click and commence the registration process. After clicking the provided link, the user is redirected to a page that requests phone number, which subsequently, a new page is shown with three steps that demand completion before the acclaimed completion of the NIMC registration. These steps include: copying a provided link, sharing it on multiple WhatsApp groups for a  provided limit before proceeding to the registration proper.  Previously, DUBAWA has carried analysis on  multiple claims that relate to NIMC, NIN registration which all turned out to be false. It is as a result of these realities that this link is subjected to scrutiny to confirm its reliability.  DUBAWA first took notice of the apparent spelling blunder obvious in the web-based message that claims to offer  NIMC registration to Nigerians. ‘Government’ was wrongly spelled as ‘Gorvernment’ and ‘unnecessary’  was also misspelled as ‘unnecesary’. Furthermore, an analysis of the website on ScamDoc (a web tool that evaluates “digital identities” reliability {email address or website} and provides answers to questions frequently asked by Internet users such as: How to check if a website is reliable or not? How to detect fraudulent emails?) reveals that the domain name is very recent (less than 6 months) with a short life expectancy that is linked to one or more countries known for being used by fraudulent websites similar to websites DUBAWA analysed in the past. Results of the analysis from ScamDoc Furthermore, the website was also discovered to be malvertizing (a word that blends malware and advertising,  to refer to techniques cybercriminals use to target people covertly) by demanding users to share the link to groups on WhatsApp. Malvertizing is carried out by buying ad space on trustworthy websites and, although the ads may appear legitimate (as the one under scrutiny), there is a malicious code hidden inside them that redirects users to fraudulent websites or installs malware on their computers or mobile devices that keeps bringing up notifications. In this case, the user is redirected to this website that talks about religious dogmas not in any way related to NIMC registration. Even though DUBAWA has contacted NIMC several times and yet to register a response, the news regarding NIN registration conducted online would have been reported widely by the media. However, no reports indicate that the NIMC registration is now carried out online. The information circulating on WhatsApp that the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) is now carrying out NIN registration online via a certain link is false. The website is found to be fraudulent and untrustworthy and is mostly used to boost page views by redirecting users fraudulently.

"Claim: Pictures making rounds on WhatsApp depict an acclaimed attack and destruction of the Fulani herdsmen’s settlement in Yewa, Ogun State.","One major discourse making headlines In the  Nigerian social sphere is the long-standing dispute existing between Fulani Herdsmen and farmers around the country. One headline reads “Ekiti warns herdsmen, farmers against acts inimical to peace,” another one says “14 feared killed by Fulani herdsmen in Delta community.” Even more, a rising avalanche of concerns as regards attacks on communities, kidnappings, and killings in most parts of Nigeria is now widely referenced to the Fulani herdsmen.  Furthermore, when the Governor of Ondo, Rotimi Akeredolu gave a seven-day ultimatum for Fulani herdsmen to vacate his state, the news generated heated controversy, especially when Sunday Igboho, a pro-Yoruba activist launched a campaign to chase out herdsmen from the southwestern states. As a result, surging narratives have been erupting depicting issues that relate to Mr. Sunday’s campaign. A typical example is some pictures going rounds on WhatsApp. The pictures claim to depict Fulani settlement in Yewa, Ogun State (Southwestern Nigeria) attacked and destroyed  presumably by Sunday Igboho.  Shared so many times on WhatsApp, these pictures are capable of inspiring unrest and painting the wrong narrative, especially if false. It is as a result of these realities that DUBAWA subjects this claim to analysis to uncover the truth and share the factual narrative.  When DUBAWA conducted a Yandex reverse image search on the first image depicting a man amidst what appears to be dead cattles, it revealed that the image first appeared in a Wikipedia article about “Global warming affecting global agriculture and food security.”  Apparently, it was taken out of context to now depict a false narrative about attacks on Fulani herdsmen in Yewa, Ogun state.  Consequently, the second picture depicting a man amidst ruins and what appears to be dead bodies laid on the ground was in reality a picture of a reported attack carried out by herdsmen in Adamawa. The picture was shared on December 5th, 2017 in tori. ng as a news report with the headline “Dead bodies everywhere: Fulani Herdsmen Attack Adamawa, Kill Many” . The third picture, depicting a village under a blazing fire, first appeared on dailynigerian.com as a news report headlined “Police vow to arrest suspected arsonists in Ebonyi community”. The news story which featured the picture was shared on February 3rd, 2021 as regards the fire that destroyed herders’ houses in  Oshibo community, Ebonyi Local Government Area. Pictures used to depict attacks on Fulani herdsmen in Yewa, Ogun State are unrelated to the actual event. They are swiveled out of different contexts to fertilise the already looming narrative about attacks on Fulani herdsmen in western Nigeria. This claim is false.

Claim: Video and audio have surfaced about students fleeing for the fear of the COVID-19 Vaccine in Lagos.,"On Wednesday, 3rd February 2021, a short video surfaced online, accompanied by a voice note. The video showed a pandemonium; students running out of their classrooms, jumping from the storey building and fleeing the school premises. The voice behind the camera was only screaming “Jesus” in the 28seconds-long video. The video was accompanied by a voice note in Hausa. The voice note claimed that the students are running for the fear of being injected with the COVID19 Vaccine. “They are running because the COVID19 Vaccine injection is to be tested on them,” he said, before continuing that “The Britons who created the COVID19 Vaccine tested it on 1,000 people, 600 died. So they decided to test it on Black people, that’s why they are in Lagos,” he said. With WhatsApp being a private platform, it is impossible to get the number of views or reach the video and voice note have attained. However, a forwarded label created by WhatsApp was stamped on the video and audio, which showed that the sender himself did not create it. He/she received it and forwarded it. With WhatsApp widely regarded as the ‘abode of fake news’, this message has the potential of already spreading farther than we can imagine. A Quick Search using InVid Verification tool, pointed us to the full Video on YouTube, posted on May 27th, 2019 and Facebook posted on May 25th, 2019.  Both Videos, 1:43seconds-long and 1:00minutes-long on YouTube and Facebook respectively, have the same caption, albeit constructed in different ways. The captions revealed that a secondary school student brought tear-gas to school, which was detonated, causing the pandemonium. “An SS2 boy in Port Harcourt brought a teargas gun and dynamite to fight SS3 students” the caption on YouTube states, while the one posted on Facebook reads “An SS2 student of CSS secondary sch. Oroworokwu, port Harcourt, on the 24th of May, brought guns and grenade teargas for a class fight between SS2 students and SS3 students. Why showing it off to his classmates, he unknowingly detonated one of the grenade teargas, And all Hell broke loose!!” Another search of the school where the incident was said to have happened, ‘CSS Secondary School, Oroworokwu, Port Harcourt, River State’, also pointed to several media reports, confirming the incident. On the 25th May, 2019, PMNews posted the same video on its website with the headline, ‘Incredible video: Pandemonium in Rivers School as student detonates teargas in class’. The story was also featured on the Leadership newspaper here, and on the BBC Pidgin, here. A few days later, Rivers State Government launched a probe into the matter, as reported by the Leadership Newspaper. Several criticisms and conspiracy theories have trailed the announcement of the development of the COVID19 Vaccine in various countries, and especially when the Nigerian Government disclosed plans to get and vaccinate Nigerians. At the onset of the COVID-19’s spread, there were conspiracy theories linking the virus to the 5G Technology, a claim severally debunked. False. The Claim that the students are running from the fear of being injected with a COVID-19 Vaccine is false.

Claim: A Twitter post claims there is a new virus from China called the Nipah virus with 75% fatality.,"A Twitter post by World Publicist (@isimaOdeh) claims there is a new virus outbreak in China called the Nipah virus. The Twitter user also claims that the virus has a fatality rate of 75%. Dubawa conducted a keyword search on Twitter and Google. Twitter’s keyword search led to other posts by Twitter users and news blogs announcing the Nipah virus as a new virus from China. A Twitter post by Instablog9ja (@instablog9ja) added that the virus is rare and is spread by fruit bats. Another Twitter post by Vixen (@pizzarhea) notes this virus could be the next pandemic. The google keyword search also led to reports on the virus. One report by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) notes that this is another virus that worries Asia. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO) Nipah virus (NiV) is a zoonotic virus that was first recognized in 1999 during an outbreak among pig farmers in Malaysia and in Bangladesh in 2001 with nearly annual outbreaks since then. The disease has also been identified periodically in eastern India. It is worthy of note that although Nipah virus has caused only a few known outbreaks in Asia, other regions may be at risk for infection, as evidence of the virus has been found in the known natural reservoir (Pteropus bat species) and several other bat species in a number of countries, including Cambodia, Ghana, Indonesia, Madagascar, the Philippines, and Thailand. Nipah Virus incubation period (interval from infection to the onset of symptoms) is believed to range from 4 to 14 days. However, an incubation period as long as 45 days have been reported. The Nipah Virus is transmitted from animals to humans, through contaminated food or directly between people. In infected people, it causes a range of illnesses from asymptomatic (subclinical) infection to acute respiratory illness and fatal encephalitis. Fruit bats of the family Pteropodidae (particularly species belonging to the Pteropus genus) are the natural hosts for Nipah virus. The virus can also cause severe disease in animals such as pigs, resulting in significant economic losses for farmers.   Human infections range from asymptomatic infection to acute respiratory infection (mild, severe), and fatal encephalitis. Infected people initially develop symptoms including fever, headaches, myalgia (muscle pain), vomiting and sore throat. This can be followed by dizziness, drowsiness, altered consciousness, and neurological signs that indicate acute encephalitis.  Some people can also experience atypical pneumonia and severe respiratory problems, including acute respiratory distress. Encephalitis and seizures occur in severe cases, progressing to coma within 24 to 48 hours. Most people who survive acute encephalitis make a full recovery, but long term neurologic conditions have been reported in survivors.   Approximately 20% of patients are left with residual neurological consequences such as seizure disorder and personality changes. A small number of people who recover subsequently relapse or develop delayed onset encephalitis. The case fatality rate is estimated at 40% to 75% which can vary by outbreak depending on local capabilities for epidemiological surveillance and clinical management. Because initial signs and symptoms of Nipah virus infection are nonspecific, the diagnosis is often not suspected at the time of presentation.  This can hinder accurate diagnosis and creates challenges in outbreak detection, effective and timely infection control measures, and outbreak response activities.  In addition, the quality, quantity, type, timing of clinical sample collection and the time needed to transfer samples to the laboratory can affect the accuracy of laboratory results. Nipah virus infection can be diagnosed with clinical history during the acute and convalescent phase of the disease. The main tests used are real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from bodily fluids and antibody detection via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Other tests used include polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay and virus isolation by cell culture. There are currently no drugs or vaccines specific for Nipah virus infection although the WHO has identified Nipah as a priority disease for the WHO Research and Development Blueprint.  For now, intensive supportive care is recommended to treat severe respiratory and neurologic complications. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in areas where there is an outbreak, there are preventive practices like regular handwashing with soap and water,  avoid contact with sick bats or pigs, avoid areas where bats are known to roost, avoid consumption of raw date palm sap, avoid consumption of fruits that may be contaminated by bats, and avoid contact with the blood or body fluids of any person known to be infected with NiV. While it is true the nipah virus exists and has a fatality rate of between 40% to 75%, it is not a new virus and it did not originate from China. The WHO noted the virus was first reported in  1999 in Malaysia. ",China,06/02/2021,https://dubawa.org/nipah-virus-how-true-is-claim-there-is-a-new-virus-outbreak-in-chinatown/
"Claim: There are some WhatsApp posts, Facebook accounts and Twitter handles claiming different names and bank accounts to photos of the same girl, soliciting financial support for a secondary school girl with a tumor.","Claim: There are some WhatsApp posts, Facebook accounts and Twitter handles claiming different names and bank accounts to photos of the same girl, soliciting financial support for a secondary school girl with a tumor.  Many of these posts are put up by scammers in a bid to fleece unsuspecting donors. Miss Praise Oluwadamilola Olugola was born on August 22, 2003 to the family of Pastor and Mrs Olugola. A student of Acme Private School, Agbede, Ikorodu, Lagos State and Head Girl of the School.  Praise was preparing for WAEC when she developed an ailment known as sinonasal tumor. Unfortunately, in the family’s move to get funds for medication, 17-year-old Praise became a subject of scam. Her father, Pastor Olugbenga Daniel Olugola, said the family had spent over five million naira and more still to spend as her left eye has been affected. She can only see with only one eye now.  While Miss Praise was in pain during this ailment, her pastor father was compelled to reach out to the public via social media for help as things got too hard and the family could no longer cope with the financial burden of getting medical treatment for her. Photo: A screenshot of the original post from the father of the girl, Pastor Daniel Olugbenga Olugola. Miss Praise’s courage, fighting spirit and the tenacity of her family paid off and she was able to undergo the first stage of the required surgery at Lagos State University Teaching Hospital, LUTH, courtesy of several donors who took interest in her plight.  While the donation was ongoing, however, some people unrelated to the family created fake social media accounts with the pictures of the girl but different names and account numbers to be credited for support. This move really foiled Praise’s further treatments, as some funds could have been diverted into fake bank accounts.  They have also been posting her photos and attaching fake names. The photos posted are Praise’s photos before her treatments.  These are some of the social media posts:            Facebook: This reporter was able to identify over twenty different posts pleading for financial support into different account numbers but with the same pictures of Miss Praise Olugola before her treatments. Few of such posts are below:  Someone even went to the extent of opening a Facebook account with the name Mary Abosede but with her pictures, soliciting for funds. While another person shared the post with the same name but different account number. Some other Facebook accounts, among many others with fake names are: https://www.facebook.com/groups/push.highest/permalink/3765667813560413/ with the name Bisola Adewale; https://twitter.com/nwankwoemekapr3/status/1334457028450856961?s=21 with the name Miss Favor; https://www.facebook.com/groups/539168580023717/permalink/735348290405744/ with the name Chinaza Okafor; https://www.facebook.com/groups/1220972381361617/permalink/3335904896535011/ with same name (Chinaza Okafor) but with another account number.

WhatsApp: Also on WhatsApp, there were so many of such posts both on personal and group platforms. This reporter was able to identify four different posts on WhatsApp, pleading for financial support into different account numbers but with the same pictures of Miss Praise Olugola before her treatments. Few of such posts are below: In an interview with the father of the girl in all of the posts, Pastor Daniel Olugbenga Olugola, this reporter discovered that the only correct name of the girl is Praise Oluwadamilola Olugola. This implies that all other posts with a different name but with the pictures of the girl are fake. Pastor Olugola also confirmed that Miss Praise was born on August 22, 2003, meaning that she was around 17 in 2020 unlike all the other posts that stated 19. The father showed the formation and gradual development of the tumor from March to May 25, 2020 when she did the first surgery in LUTH; noting that it was as if petrol was added to fire after the surgery in May, because it was after the surgery that it exploded and became this bad. Pastor Olugola told this reporter that after the escalation, two major tests were carried out on his daughter, and it was discovered that the only available treatments for her in Nigeria was Chemotherapy and Radiotherapy, as the COVID-19 lockdown did not allow trying to fly her to India, a country believed to be best in surgeries like Sinonasal Tumor. Although her immuno test was sent by DHL to India for a second report, Praise had to undergo five cycles of chemotherapy, which she completed in November, and had her last Radiotherapy on December 30, 2020. She returned home in the first week of January 2021, after spending over six months in the hospital.  It was also discovered that all account numbers aside that of the father of the girl, which is Union Bank account number 0088888104, with the account name Daniel Olugbenga Olugola, are scams. Also, the reporter got to know that the girl in the circulated pictures is no more in such a state as she has undergone chemotherapies and is now in better health. Photo: Miss Praise Olugola. It has been discovered that all picture posts of Praise Olugola not carrying her name and/ or her father’s Union Bank account number 0088888104 are fake. Also, Miss Praise is no more in the very bad state posted by scammers; she is now much better than she was in the year 2020 but still needs to treat her left eye which is presently unable to see. The researcher produced this fact-check per the Dubawa 2020 Fellowship partnership with Broadcasting Corporation of Oyo State to facilitate the ethos of “truth” in journalism and enhance media literacy in the country.

"Claim: a viral WhatsApp message claims that non-respiratory symptoms such as loss of appetite, abdominal pain, diarrhea, confusion, bitter taste, dry mouth, eye problems, giddiness, and even skin changes could also be symptoms of COVID-19.","For some COVID-19 patients, the symptoms started with difficulty in breathing; for others, it was severe coughing while others complained about the loss of smell and taste. Whatever the case may be, the mutations with the COVID-19 virus have transited into a major battle for health officials around the world. While the symptom of COVID-19 is usually linked to coughing and other respiratory symptoms, the transformation in the virus itself seems to breed an enormous need for fresh concern.  Alarmingly, Dr. Soumya Swaminathan of the World health organization even affirmed some changes with the nature of the virus:  “From the beginning of the year, we’ve been tracking this virus and we know that it’s gone through a lot of changes and there’ve been variants before. Now this particular time there have been two particular variants that have been reported to WHO. One was identified in the UK and one was identified in South Africa. They do have one change in common, we call it the N501Y mutation. But otherwise, the two are different. And the reason there’s a concern is that both of these variants were associated with an increase in the number of cases in both of these countries. And scientists have now studied this and have found that these variants do tend to spread faster, they’re more transmissible or more infectious.”  Amidst this surging tension are also diverse information about new spectra for COVID-19 symptoms. Chiefly amongst such is a message making rounds on WhatsApp. The information claims that non-respiratory symptoms such as loss of appetite, abdominal pain, diarrhea, confusion, bitter taste, dry mouth, eye problems, giddiness, and implies that almost any symptoms of illness will require one to take a COVID-19 test. Finally, the message beckoned on readers to wear a facemask.  COVID-19, like most other prominent issues, has attracted a massive influx of diverse information. On the other, the other hand, the multiplicity of such information has caused confusion and even arguments amongst members of the public. Especially with the case of hydroxychloroquine as COVID-19 cure and other mythical claims. It’s as a result of this reality that DUBAWA subjects this information to scrutiny.  DUBAWA first reached out to  Dr Jean Baptiste NIKIEMA, Regional Adviser, Essential Medicines at WHO Africa Regional Office in Brazzaville who, though yet to reply, referred us to the WHO website for more detailed information through Ms. Charity, the WHO communication officer. Conformingly, the details found in the website aligns with that of the claim.  The World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed all the outlined   COVID-19 symptoms, according to WHO the virus affects different people in different ways. Most infected people will develop mild to moderate illness and recover without hospitalization. It categorised the symptoms into three, which also coincides  with the claimant’s proposition.  Aches and pains, sore throat, diarrhoea, conjunctivitis , headache, loss of taste or smell, a rash on skin, or discolouration of fingers or toes. Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath chest pain or pressure loss of speech or movement. In the same context, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) signalled   new symptoms that also aligns with the claimants viral WhatsApp message. It explained that: “People with COVID-19 have had a wide range of symptoms reported – ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness. Symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus. People with these symptoms may have COVID-19:  The Centre further stressed that: “This list does not include all possible symptoms. CDC will continue to update this list as we learn more about COVID-19.” Following  a recent interview with Dr. Frank McGeorge from the Center for Disease Control CDC, COVID-19 is also producing symptoms of diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and appetite loss in a number of patients young and old. He added that “A recent study out of Stanford University School of Medicine found that nearly one-third of 116 patients infected with the coronavirus reported mild gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. While earlier reports showed that among roughly 200 patients in China, more than half experienced diarrhea, nausea or vomiting.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has also acknowledged gastrointestinal GI issues on its list of COVID-19 warning signs. Dr. Frank stressed that “There’s no question at this point that GI symptoms can be a manifestation of COVID-19,  oftentimes these symptoms can come on even in the absence of the more typical and recognized markers of coronavirus infection, such as fever and cough”. As regards other indicators such as   dizziness, headache, and confusion. A study conducted by the chief of neuro-infectious diseases at Northwestern Medicine in Chicago found that: “About 4 out of 5 patients hospitalized with Covid-19 suffer neurologic symptoms such as muscle pain, headaches, confusion, dizziness, and the loss of smell or taste, new research shows.” This finding is also similar to another study conducted by the John Hopkins Novel Coronavirus Research Compendium (NCRC)  found that neurological manifestations such as the one in headaches, dizziness, confusion, etc.  were present in 42 percent of patients at the onset of COVID-19 symptoms and in 82 percent of patients at any time during the disease course. For older adults, in particular, these neurological effects can be just as devastating as the pulmonary impacts of coronavirus infection. They can also be easily overlooked or dismissed as dementia or other diseases common with age, the study outlined. New studies and findings have confirmed that non-respiratory symptoms such as loss of appetite, abdominal pain, diarrhea, confusion, bitter taste, dry mouth, eye problems, giddiness, and even skin changes could also be symptoms of COVID-19.

Claim: a viral message making rounds on WhatsApp claims that the World Health Organisation (WHO) has approved a COVID-19 herbal remedy discovered by a certain Indian student.,"Claim: a viral message making rounds on WhatsApp claims that the World Health Organisation (WHO) has approved a COVID-19 herbal remedy discovered by a certain Indian student. The claim that WHO has approved a COVID-19 herbal remedy with black pepper powder, ginger juice, and honey as ingredients is false and misleading. The claim is refuted by WHO and experts have confirmed the ingredients as insufficient and impotent to be termed a cure for COVID-19. The  Novel COVID-19 virus has forged a new spectrum in society. A new normal that has overhauled what used to be normal, to now be totally abnormal. Yet amidst this avalanche of unusual scenery is also an influx of diverse claims regarding cures, and remedies for COVID-19. These claims are most often predominant on social media, suggesting strategies and diagnosis for the virus.   Evenmore, the fear and anxiety COVID-19 instills, seem to make people susceptible to such information and enthusiastic in sharing  such information to their loved ones, online community groups and colleagues, etc. Though some of these heralded messages hold some shreds of truth, most of them turn out to be misleading.  In this instance, a viral WhatsApp message claims that the World Health Organization (WHO) has approved a COVID-19 herbal remedy that was discovered by Ramu, a certain Indian  student from the Pondicherry University. The claim posits that the herbal remedy is the first of its kind to be approved by the WHO with 100% efficacy confirmed. It further beckoned on users to distribute the information to “friends and family”. The message read: “COVID -19 HERBAL SOLUTION JUST IN. Finally, an INDIAN student from PONDICHERRY University, named RAMU, found a home remedy for Covid-19 which is for the first time accepted by the World health organization( WHO.)   – He proved that by adding 1 tablespoon of black pepper powder to 2 tablespoons of honey and ginger juice for 5 consecutive days, it would remove the effects of the covid-19  And finally disappear 100%   – The whole world is beginning to accept this remedy.  Finally good news in 2021 !! PLEASE DISTRIBUTE THIS INFORMATION TO ALL OF YOUR FAMILY MEMBERS AND FRIENDS. Efficacy is 100% confirmed.” In recent times, DUBAWA has debunked multiple claims and myths about the COVID-19 cure. In one instance, a post on Facebook announced that the National Agency For Food and Drugs Administration and Control (NAFDAC) has approved the PaxHerbal-remedy as a treatment for COVID-19. Yet after some analysis was carried out, we discovered it was a hoax. Also, several such messages with claims about natural home remedies having the ability to cure COVID-19 have been making  rounds since the pandemic broke. However, as before, none of these have been proved to be effective in curing COVID-19. Significantly, the timely and sufficient scrutiny of such claims is vital in directing and guarding unsuspecting members of the public on the right practices to inculcate as regards the virus and the access to fact-based information that directly relates to their health and general well being. It is as regards this need that DUBAWA subjects the claim to scrutiny, to uncover its verity and determine its validity and reliability especially as it relates to the general public.  A preliminary query conducted by DUBAWA showed  that  in April 2020, when claims about COVID-19 home remedy cures became rampant,   WHO clarified that ginger and honey may not have any effect in curing or treating the disease. At a press conference in Geneva, Dr. Michael Ryan, executive director of the WHO Health Emergencies Program, said that while it could have soothing effects, or even provide reassurance during an illness, it should not be assumed to be effective in treating COVID-19. In his words, he stated that: “I think we have to be careful from what we would consider to be the traditional remedies that people use for making themselves feel better during the common cold or the flu or any of this. We’ve all had illnesses, and some of us like to take a drink with honey, some like to take ginger…But it’s a different thing to say that something is effective in treating the disease. At this moment there is no therapy that has been proven to be effective in the treatment of COVID-19.” In the same vein WHO has refuted the claim and renounced its purported cure.   The WHO communication officer, Ms. Charity Warigon confirmed that “This is fake news and WHO has not approved any of such home remedies as COVID-19 cure.” While, Dr Jean Baptiste NIKIEMA, Regional Adviser, Essential Medicines at WHO Africa Regional Office in Brazzaville, who replied to DUBAWA via a mail also explained that: “Until now there is no cure for COVID-19 that has been scientifically proven. It is important to note that large clinical trials are necessary to conclude on the efficacy of therapeutics against COVID-19. With a very limited number of participants in trials, the recovery can be attributed to any product used by the patients during the sickness. When the number of participants in clinical trials increases, the inefficiency of the product will become evident.  This already happened with Chloroquine, Hydroxychloroquine and Remdesivir last year. WHO kicked off last year, the Solidarity Clinical Trial for COVID-19 Treatments. Solidarity is an international clinical trial to help find an effective treatment for COVID-19, launched by the World Health Organization and partners. It is one of the largest international randomized trials for COVID-19 treatment for almost 12 000 patients in 500 hospital sites in over 30 countries.” Concerning the ingredients,  Dr. Suranjit Chatterjee, Senior Consultant, Internal Medicine at Indraprastha Apollo Hospital, in a video interview that regards black pepper powder, honey, and ginger juice as COVID-19 cures, explained that there was no medical basis or evidence for stating that either of these ingredients could cure COVID-19. He clarified that:  “They might soothe the symptoms, they might in some way be immune-boosters, but in no way do they treat the infection in itself. Once you’ve had the infection, they don’t treat it. They have no definite proven role in the treatment of coronavirus.” Dr. Chatterjee added that: “Earlier, in pandemics when there was not much medical management, solutions like these were like a solace to people. But at present, there is fairly good medical management which can improve outcomes, so trying to do these and not actually approaching healthcare facilities for the disease could be counter-productive”. Deductively, this viral message lacks credible reference and the sufficient fact to back its imposition. It’s not anywhere published by a reputable media and has only been in existence as a broadcast message. While black pepper and honey have lots of value to human health and ginger is also prevalent in natural treatment to boost immunity, these ingredients are not a cure   for the novel coronavirus. Also, WHO has distanced itself from this claim, flagging it as a false claim.

Claim: A picture being shared on WhatsApp shows the correct way to wear a medical mask when sick and when healthy.,"Masks are a key measure to suppress the transmission of coronavirus (COVID-19) and save lives. Masks should however not be used alone but as part of other COVID-19 prevention measures, like physical distancing, good ventilation, washing of hands, etc. A picture going viral on WhatsApp claims that the correct way to wear the medical mask if you are sick is to wear the coloured side out and if you are not sick, the white side out. This the image explains is because the white side is the filter and it stops germs from getting in if you are not sick and if you are sick it prevents germs from getting out. This image was accredited to Nigeria Immigration service. Dubawa visited the site of Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS) and found this image is the second image on its homepage. Dubawa also discovered this image had been shared since March 2020. Dubawa also conducted a keyword search on what medical face masks are, their types and their proper use. Depending on the type, masks can be used for either protection of healthy persons or to prevent onward transmission. Cloth face mask/covering is made out of everyday fabric and serves as a barrier to respiratory droplets. It however does not completely protect against COVID-19. Respirators, also called N95 masks, are designed to protect from small particles in the air, like viruses. They’re certified by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. The name comes from the fact that they can filter 95% of airborne particles but it is not resistant to oil. Surgical face masks are fairly loose-fitting, disposable masks approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use as medical devices. These masks prevent large droplets of bodily fluids that may contain viruses or other germs from escaping via the nose and mouth. They also protect against splashes and sprays from other people, such as those from sneezes and coughs. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), these are also known as medical masks and are composed of 3 layers of synthetic nonwoven materials configured to have filtration layers sandwiched in the middle available in different thicknesses with various levels of fluid-resistance and filtration. Outer (fluid-repellent) layer: Typically coloured blue or green, this layer repels fluid, helping to reduce the chance that viruses and bacteria from the air attach to the mask. Middle (high-efficiency filter) layer: The middle layer is what does the hard work in capturing viruses and bacteria. Any particles which get past the outside layers are filtered here. Inner (absorbent) layer: The inner layer captures and absorbs moisture, reducing the chance of any mucus or bacteria from leaving the mask when the wearer coughs or talks. The WHO advises that a surgical or medical face mask be worn by health workers, those caring for COVID-19 victims, those with symptoms suggestive of COVID-19,  persons aged 60 and above or anyone with pre-existing medical conditions as they are at greater risk of developing serious illness. Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) also agrees that medical masks be worn by these groups of persons.  The WHO video on how to properly wear a medical face mask did not speak on the proper sides of a medical mask to wear. It only noted who should wear a medical mask and the correct process of putting it on and taking it off. Smart Air, however, provides details on which side of the medical mask to use. Smart Air is a company dedicated to helping people protect themselves from the harms of air pollution by providing free, data-backed content on air pollution, air purifiers and masks to dispel myths and provide honest, reliable information to help keep people’s lungs clean. According to smartairfilters, the coloured side (whether blue or green) should be outside but if the mask comes in one colour for both sides or all white, then the feel of the material should be used to determine which part should be out. For such masks, the softer part should be inside as it is the moisture absorbent layer while the rougher part should be outside as it is the moisture-repellent layer. It is not advisable to use mask ear loops as a determinant for the direction of your mask as they are not consistent. While sometimes the straps are attached to the outside layer, other times the straps are attached to the inside layer. A video on how to properly wear a surgical or medical mask is also available here. While the image accredited to NIS is true as Dubawa found the same image on its page; the information contained in the image is not entirely true. Dubawa’s findings show that for both healthy or sick persons, the coloured side of medical masks should be worn outside. While the white part should be inside and this is supported by the functions of the different layers of the medical mask.

"Claim: There is a WhatsApp post claiming that ewedu leaves kill Coronavirus. The post, which is also on a website and Twitter handle, stated that: “Krain krain has flavonoid that aids the absorption of zinc in the body. Zinc can enter the virus ‌ infected cells and stop corona virus from reproducing. Good news. Eat African! Ewedu.”. ‘Molokhia leaves help curb reproduction of coronavirus'”.","An article published by Medical Brief on May 6, 2020, noted that the World Health Organisation (WHO) “welcomes innovations around the world including repurposing drugs, traditional medicines, and developing new therapies in the search for potential treatments for COVID-19”. The medical article explained that the WHO recognises that traditional, complementary and alternative medicine has many benefits and Africa has a long history of traditional medications and practitioners that play an important role in providing care to populations. It affirms that even if therapies are derived from traditional and natural practice, establishing their efficacy and safety through rigorous clinical trials is critical. As stated in this medical article, one would want to know the level of safety, efficacy, and quality of such traditional medicine. According to one of the articles claiming this cure, studies have shown that the ewedu leaves, botanically called ‘corchorus olitorius’, contain flavonoid that helps zinc to enter into the virus-infected cell and prevents the reproduction mechanism of its RNA genetic material to stop the virus from reproducing inside the body”.  The edible plant found across Africa and Asia, as well as some parts of Europe, North America and Australia, has many local names, including ‘jute mallow’, ‘bush okra’, ‘molokhia’, ‘edewu’, ‘ahihara’, ‘malafiya’ and ‘krinkrin’. It is said to be rich in some vitamins, and can help the body absorb the mineral zinc. But has it been scientifically and medically proven and accepted to cure the coronavirus? A Clinical Herbalist who studied Botany and Ethnomedicine and is also the Managing Director of NARL Specialist Clinic, Mrs Christiana -Olapade Ojo, told Dubawa that there is a lot of misconceptions about the use of herbal remedy for management and healing of so many conditions, which, in most cases, do not work that way. Highlighting few complementary tips to fortify immune system on one of her Facebook posts, the Clinical herbalist indicated that Ewedu (Corchorus olitorius, jute plant) should be included in a daily diet because “it is traditionally known for its antiviral properties and some recent reports are also attesting to its anticancer potentials…Which also points to its immune boosting properties.” Speaking on some assumptions that a person can eat one thing and get well, Mrs Olapade Ojo explained that: “Those things don’t work like that, they work in synergy”; adding that: “Eating ewedu alone will not, and WILL NOT in capital letters, WILL NOT in anyway cure Coronavirus.” She noted that such leaves have to be used in synergy with some other things. To a dietician and nutritionist, Miss Promise Chimuanya Ugochukwu, zinc, as a micronutrient, is not peculiar to Ewedu alone, there are other leaves or food with zinc. So, Coronavirus disease cure is not just by the micronutrient, rather, it has to do with claims that have been scientifically proven.  Miss Ugochukwu noted that other sources of zinc are meat, whole grains and nuts; adding that “Whatever nutrients you can find in ewedu can also be found in other foods; not that Ewedu has whatever special properties.” Ewedu can not cure coronavirus disease. Although, WHO is working with research institutions to select traditional medicine products which can be investigated for clinical efficacy and safety for COVID-19 treatment, it has not approved ewedu as a cure.

"Claim: Two sets of viral WhatsApp messages claim two different offers: the first offering 50,000 temporary Jobs and the second with a WHO logo promising 500 Euros.","Claim: Two sets of viral WhatsApp messages claim two different offers: the first offering 50,000 temporary Jobs and the second with a WHO logo promising 500 Euros. Both claims – one offering election committee jobs and the other 500 Euros WHO fund are fraudulent and completely fake. A viral WhatsApp message which keeps resurfacing the app’s group chats, carrying the logo of the World Health Organization (WHO), claims to offer 500 Euros to people who participated in a pool of relevant data submission. The link attached to the claim asks people to click and progress to the next stages as they fill the questionnaire which asks various questions on business..  The first click on the link takes users to a session that congratulates them on their selection to receive a support from the WHO which would qualify them to receive 500 Euros and brings forth subsequent questions that will further request detailed information from them. The second claim which is the promise of a 50,000 temporary election committee jobs also has a link attached that takes participants through various stages of questioning and then asks participants to share the message to ten or more people to be ultimately eligible for the prize. It has a broader message of JOBS OPPORTUNITIES 2021 and requests applications from young people across the country. The so-called WHO COVID-19 website that claims to offer money to participants online has been carefully verified by Dubawa and all the results have proven it to be fake. The website attached to the claim “Whatsapp16.xyz” was analyzed by Dubawa using the ScamDoc tool and the results from the analysis reveals that the domain scored 1% on Trust Score and that is interpreted as a very bad trust score. The analysis further states that the domain name is a very recent one-less than six months and categorized as short life expectancy domain. ScamDoc finally stated that the domain name is linked to one or more countries known for being used by fraudulent websites. These revelations confirm that the website is a fraudulent website and participation in the process brings no benefit to participants but rather exposes them to internet fraudsters. The domain has a Like of over 200,000 and a comment box with messages from people claiming to have received the money. This is all part of the process of trying to authenticate a fake process. Moreover, the World Health Organization has strongly condemned  fake news and the overall infodemic challenge during this pandemic and does not give out money in this fashion as claimed by this domain. The Election Committee job claim had its domain equally checked on ScamDoc and the “Bit.ly” domain looks authentic but further probe into the additional links gives a 4% trust score which is also a very bad trust score and concludes that the is also linked to one or more countries known for being used by fraudulent websites. The link on first click will take you to a page that claims to give Le 50,000-200,000 daily but at the end of the process states that they “may need many reporters across India”.   The domain which promises stipend in Sierra Leonean Currency is at the end of the process needing reporters across India. This 50,000 temporary election committee job offer does not state any specific country and any particular election. It is, therefore, misleading.. As convincing as they may appear, the two websites with the bogus claims have been thoroughly investigated by Dubawa using standard verification tools and analysis, and the results have all proven that they are fake and totally misleading.

"Claim: a certain website claims that the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) is offering  N10, 000 and 5GB as a reward program for those who have been using their SIM cards for more than three months.","Claim: a certain website claims that the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) is offering  N10, 000 and 5GB as a reward program for those who have been using their SIM cards for more than three months.  The claim circulating on WhatsApp that the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) is offering  N10, 000 and 5GB as a verification reward program for those who have been using their SIM cards for more than three months is false. The commission has confirmed that it’s false and the website has been verified to be fraudulent.  The National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) operates and regulates matters of national identity in Nigeria with services covering National Identification Number (NIN) enrolment and issuance, National e-ID card issuance, identity verification as well as data harmonization and authentication.  The National Identification Number (NIN) is a set of numbers assigned to individuals in Nigeria to identify them as bonafide citizens. Since the government announced the compulsory linkage of NIN numbers to mobile SIM cards, NIN registration centers have been witnessing a massive turnout of people who are yet to register.  As a result, telecommunications companies have also been licensed to register people who do not have National Identity Numbers (NIN) to reduce the enormous crowds at the offices of the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC).  This reality has accrued a preponderant influence on NIN registration that most news about it now easily grasp public attention. Parallel to this eventuality is a lingering website on WhatsApp that claims to offer N10,000 and 5GB worth of data as NIN verification reward programs to persons whose SIM cards have been in use for the past three months.  Shared multiple times on different WhatsApp groups, the information transits as a web-based message with the outline:  “NIN VERIFICATION Check if Your number has been chosen by NIN to receive 5GB As part of the Verification REWARD Program For Who has been using the SIM for more than three months  FOR ALL NETWORK USERS  Deadline:30-01-2021″ Click https://nin-5gb-offer.online After clicking the provided link, the user is redirected to a page that requests the user’s phone number to verify eligibility.  Subsequently, after the user has provided a phone number, a new page is shown with three steps that demand completion before the user can claim the gift. The instructions read:  “Congratulations, you are listed to receive a cash prize of 5GB and ₦10,000 free!  How to earn your cash prize?  1. To get 5GB from NIN, First click the green button “WHATSAPP” and send this information to 12 groups on WhatsApp!  2. After sending the message, you will go to the next step where you will be able to get the data and money sent to your Mobile for 2 minutes.“ Send to groups Recently, DUBAWA has conducted multiple analyses on such web-based messages, and most of them turned out to be misleading and fraudulent. As a result of the pre-existing skepticism, DUBAWA subjects this website to scrutiny to verify its genuineness. Head of corporate communications, National Identity Management Commission (NIMC), Mr Kayode Adegoke,  confirmed that the claim was false and there is no such thing going on. He said that “the commission is currently not doing anything as such and it’s false. Members of the public should be aware.”   Furthermore, an analysis of the website on ScamDoc (a web tool that evaluates “digital identities” reliability {email address or website} and provides answers to questions frequently asked by Internet users such as: How to check if a website is reliable or not? How to detect fraudulent emails?) reveals that the domain name is very recent (less than 6 months) with a short life expectancy that is linked to one or more countries known for being used by fraudulent websites. Even more, the demand by this website that users share the link to groups on WhatsApp reveals it to be Malvertising, a word that blends malware and advertising,  to refer to techniques cybercriminals use to target people covertly. Typically, by buying ad space on trustworthy websites, and although the ads may appear legitimate (as the one under scrutiny), there is a malicious code hidden inside them that redirects users to fraudulent websites or installs malware on their computers or mobile devices. The information circulating on WhatsApp that the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) is offering  N10, 000 and 5GB as a verification reward program for those who have been using their SIM cards for more than three months is false.

Claim: A viral meme claims that the bacteria that causes Leprosy is spread through airborne respiratory droplets and face masks are helpful to protect against such bacteria.,"A meme shared by Health Volunteers Nigeria Initiative claims the bacteria that causes leprosy is spread through airborne respiratory droplets by coughing or sneezing. The caption in the tweet notes that face masks can be helpful in preventing it. Dubawa conducted a keyword search on Leprosy and its means of transmission. Dubawa also studied documents on the disease. Leprosy is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium leprae and affects the skin, the peripheral nerves, mucosa of the upper respiratory tract, and the eyes.  According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Mycobacterium leprae multiplies slowly with an incubation period of averagely 5 years. Leprosy is also known as Hansen’s disease. Symptoms of Leprosy include muscle weakness, numbness in the hands, arms, feet, and legs, and skin lesions. Symptoms may occur within 1 year but can also take as long as 20 years or even more to occur. There are three systems of classifying leprosy. The first is determined by how a person’s immune system responds to the disease. Here we have tuberculoid, lepromatous, and borderline. The second system of classification is by the WHO which classified it based on the type and number of affected skin areas. Here we have paucibacillary; where there are five or fewer lesions and no bacteria detected in the skin samples and multibacillary. The third system uses the Ridley-Jopling system. It has five classifications based on the severity of symptoms. They are Tuberculoid leprosy, Borderline tuberculoid leprosy, Mid-borderline leprosy, Borderline lepromatous leprosy, and Lepromatous leprosy. There’s also another form of leprosy called indeterminate leprosy but is not included in the Ridley-Jopling classification system. It’s considered the very early form of leprosy where a person will have only one skin lesion which may resolve or progress further to one of the five forms of leprosy within the Ridley-Jopling system. Leprosy spreads through contact with the mucosal secretions of a person who has the infection. This can happen when a person with leprosy sneezes or coughs. The WHO also noted it is likely transmitted via droplets, from the nose and mouth, during close and frequent contact with untreated cases. According to the WHO clinical and diagnosis management of leprosy patients, constant washing of hands and the use of face masks was recommended. The claim that leprosy spreads through respiratory droplets is true as the WHO  document on leprosy listed this as the likely means of transmission. While this is true, the disease isn’t highly contagious. However, close and repeated contact with an untreated person for a longer period of time can lead to contracting the disease. The second claim that face masks are helpful in preventing leprosy is true as it is recommended for caregivers in charge of patients and the patients themselves. It is also worthy of note that leprosy is curable with multidrug therapy (MDT) and through the use of antibiotics like dapsone (Aczone), rifampin (Rifadin), clofazimine (Lamprene), minocycline (Minocin), and ofloxacin (Ocuflux).

Claim: Twitter users claim that eating coconut causes coughing.,"Claim: Twitter users claim that eating coconut causes coughing. It is not true. Well processed and channeled coconut is even good for coughing. A Twitter account Freeman, (@charlolar), posted on October 21, 2014, that what causes coughing is coconut. The handle stated that: “@iam_dannex: What Causes Cough? #iNogoTell_by_icee songOftheSeason” coconut. Another twitter account, uncle uche (@uche_uncle), reacted to the tweet recently.  The user commenting on the effect of coconut and corn on cough tweeted on July 4, 2020, “If you are having respiratory issues …. roasted corn and coconut is very likely to trigger a stupid cough in you.” According to a Homeopathy Doctor, Dr Hetal Jariwala, the assumption is not true because coconut is very healthy to the human body. He noted that coconut products, such as coconut water “will not cause cough but it depends on person to person and the individual’s resistance power to tolerate any food items”. In a telephone interview with Dubawa, a Consultant Pulmonologist at the University College Hospital, UCH, Ibadan, Dr Sogaolu, said the claim of such a cause is false. Also, a medical doctor in Ibadan, Dr Oluwaseun Ige, in an interview with Dubawa said Coconut does not cause cough. He said many coughs are caused by infections such as common cold, pneumonia, but there are also non-infectious causes such as smoking, allergies, irritants. He noted that cough is a reflex initiated when the respiratory tract is irritated by infection or any irritant. The reflex results in expulsion of air from the lungs that carries the foreign material from the respiratory tract. Coughing resulted from eating coconut is a protective reflex to clear off any meat that can get its way into the airways. If the meat gets into the airways, that could result in a medical emergency. Asia’s Best Female Chef 2019, Garima Arora, also indicated in a post that no matter which illness anybody is suffering from, it is important to keep one’s self hydrated by drinking lots of water; noting that coconut and lemon water help to hydrate one’s body when suffering from cough and cold. According to a researcher, Larissa Andrews, typically, the coconut, on the other hand, is known as the sweetness food containing all of the important nourishment required for the human body. In India, it is known with the brand of “narial” and regarded as being holy fruit which usually holds a fundamental place in spiritual ceremonies. It is discovered to be adding nourishment, fattening and conditioning dietary food and turns out to be an incredible tonic to get wellbeing. The liquid of the coconut is overflowing with plenty of vitamin c which usually meets the everyday desire for the body. The coconut liquid comprises potassium, calcium, copper, phosphorus, chlorine, magnesium, sulphur and sodium. From time immemorial, there is a common assumption that you do not eat coconut when coughing as it can aggravate cough. In a form of teasing, some friends even offer coconut to their friends that have cough, ironically indicating the negative effect of taking coconut products during cough. But is there any relationship between coconut and cough? Does this fruit truly trigger or aggravate cough? Are there some hidden facts to be exposed concerning this ancient belief? Cough is a person’s body method of responding once something irritates the throat or airways, which stimulates nerves that sends a message to the brain. The brain then tells muscles in the chest and abdomen to push air out of the lungs to force out the irritant. This, most times, results in an occasional cough, which is normal and healthy. But a cough that persists for many weeks or one that brings up discoloured or bloody mucous secretion might indicate a condition that wants medical attention.  Hence, it is a common reflex action that clears your throat of mucus or foreign irritants. Also known as tussis, cough is a voluntary or involuntary act that clears the throat and breathing passage of foreign particles, microbes, irritants, fluids, and mucus; it is a rapid expulsion of air from the lungs. Coughing can be done deliberately or as part of a reflex; likewise, it can be a sign of a serious illness, but more often, it will clear up on its own without the need for medical attention. While everyone coughs to clear throats from time to time, a number of conditions can cause more frequent coughing. According to the Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research, MFMER, an occasional cough is instigated to help clear irritants and secretions from a person’s lungs and prevents infection. However, a cough that persists for weeks is sometimes the results of a medical drawback. In several cases, quite one cause is concerned. The following causes, alone or together, are responsible for the majority of cases of chronic cough: Emphysema is additionally incorporated below this term, and chronic bronchitis and emphysema often coexist in current or former smokers with COPD. Less commonly, chronic cough may be caused by the following: Medical experts do not agree with the claim that coconut can cause or aggravate coughs.

Claim: A 13 seconds video shared on Twitter by Disclose. tv claims that President Biden said “there is nothing we can do to change the trajectory of the pandemic in the next several months” in a speech.,"On 20th January 2021,  President Joe Biden was sworn in as the 46th U.S. President. Previous events that transpired before the swearing-in ceremony saw an avalanche of unprecedented issues that challenged the American democracy. Former President Trump’s refusal to acknowledge the outcome of the election  and the protest at the U.S. Capitol that saw protesters breaking into the building was the climax of it all. Though Biden’s victory to the Presidency marked a new dawn for governance by the Democratic Party, it also seems to have come with a bundle of discourse and controversies.  Just 2 days after Biden was inaugurated as President,  Disclose tv shared a 13 seconds video on their Twitter handle, captioned: “JUST IN-  President Biden now says “there is nothing we can do to change the trajectory of the pandemic in the next several months” . The short video clip that depicted Biden saying those words appeared an irony to what he once promised Americans about the pandemic. President Biden who once heavily criticized Trump for his lack of plans and initiatives to combat the ravaging COVID-19 pandemic causing distress to Americans assured  of  better plans to curb the spread of the virus and the hardship it is causing Americans If he wins the elections. Thus, it was not surprising that when the video came on Twitter just two days after the inauguration attracted 3.6 million views, 6.2 thousand retweets, 12.9 thousand reactions, and over 10 thousand comments, it was even further featured on jewishbreakingnews  Instagram and the Todd Starnes Show on Facebook with the same outlines captioned. Even more, a  plethora of diverse opinions that followed the video on the comment section depicts multiple polarities; some users acknowledged the claim and criticized the President for not having a plan while others were speculative and skeptical of the information. A typical example is the user, Keith Maniac (@CutItOutPutin) who in consensus with the claim commented that “He harangued Trump all last year, made many pronouncements about “getting the virus under control,” then on day 2 of his administration, “welp, nothing can be done!” He will get zero pushback from the news media.” While another user, [email protected] (@missingahzu) shared a sense of skepticism to the claim “I’d want to see/hear the entirety of this statement… it sounds like it’s being taken out of context”  Whatever the case may be, American politics has drawn worldwide attention in recent times perhaps because of its long-standing principles of an ideal democracy which has blossomed to become a standard for new democracies. Also, such information that has gained traction can easily mislead several people or planned unrest in a setting that is trying to regain its calm. It is on account of these realities that DUBAWA looks into this claim to clarify the narrative and identify the veracity of the viral information attributed to President Biden.  When Dubawa accessed the full speech from where the claimant  spooned, it turned out that Biden’s statement was taken out of context to paint a rather bogus narrative. Though President Biden actually made the statement while delivering a speech, it turned out he was only making emphasis on what may happen if his economic recovery plan is not actualised earnestly. In fact, the speech was delivered by President Biden as a presentation of his plans to combat COVID-19 and the hardship it was unloading on the American people. It was also a justification of why he has resolved to sign an executive order to set the Economic Recovery Package plan into action. As regards President Biden and the actual context of the statement, “there is nothing we can do to change the trajectory of the pandemic in the next several months” it was stylized to paint a different  narrative in contrast to his actual notions. It was explicitly identified in the complete video that lasted 18 minutes, where President Biden talked at length about why it was important to sign an executive order to adopt the economic recovery plan. His speech   also explained how the economic recovery plan will provide bigger stimulus checks,  more aid for the unemployed, the hungry, and those facing eviction. While also pledging more support for small businesses, states, and local governments; increased funding for vaccinations and testing. Unfortunately, It was in this context that the acclaimed statement was extracted to paint a rather contrary narrative.  In the complete speech, where the acclaimed statement was taken from, Biden said:  “In just a few days, it’s just been a few days since I outlined this plan and it’s received bipartisan support from the majority of American mayors and governors. Businesses and labor organizations have together welcomed it as an urgent action that’s needed. Even Wall Street firms have underscored its importance. In fact, an analysis by Moody’s estimates that if we pass our American Rescue Plan, the economy would create 7.5 million jobs just in this year alone. That would be on the way to more than 18 million, I think it was 18,600,000 jobs that they believe would be created over the four-year period with our Build Back Better recovery plan. And with our American Rescue Plan, our economy would return to full employment a full year faster than without the plan, even President Trump’s. President Trump’s now, not some liberal organization. President Trump’s top former economic advisor, Kevin Hassett said, quote, “He absolutely is in favor of this rescue plan.” “This almost doesn’t have a partisan piece to it. We’re seeing the support because this plan takes a step that we so urgently need. More than just a step number of steps. It funds big parts of the COVID-19 national strategy that I released yesterday, we released yesterday. Our national strategy puts us on a war footing to aggressively speed up our COVID-19 response, especially on vaccines and testing and reopening our schools. I found it fascinating yesterday, the press asked the question: is a 100 million enough? Week before they were saying, “Biden, you’re crazy. You can’t do 100 million in 100 days.” Well, we’re going to God-willing not only do 100 million, we’re going to do more than that, but we have to do this. We have to move. The American Rescue Plan also includes economic relief for most Americans who are in need. We’re going to finish the job of getting a total of $2,000 in direct payments to folks. $600, which was already passed is simply not enough. If you still have to choose between paying your rent, putting food on the table, we’ll extend unemployment insurance benefits for millions of workers beyond the deadline that’s now set. It means that 16 million Americans who are currently relying on unemployment benefits while they look for work can count on these checks continuing to be there in the middle of this crisis. The American Rescue Plan also addresses the growing housing crisis in America. Approximately 14 million Americans, 14 million have fallen behind on rent, and many risk eviction. If we fail to act, there’ll be a wave of evictions and foreclosures in the coming months as this pandemic rages on. Because there’s nothing we can do to change the trajectory of the pandemic in the next several months.” Evidently, the statement was taken out of context and stylized to suit a biased narrative. Sadly, the complete video did not attract  even a thousand views as compared to the one under scrutiny. Information taken out of context can be used to mislead and paint an entirely different narrative as in this case. The Statement President Biden made was obviously taken out of context. After analyzing the complete speech, it turned out that Biden was only outlining a plan he intends to sign as an executive order to combat the crisis America currently faces, especially regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. This 13 seconds video taken out of a full length 18 minutes speech that was delivered by President Joe Biden is misleading.

"Claim: A report by the Peoples Gazette claims the Alaafin of Oyo wrote the President on the security issues of the South West, noting the Yorubas have what it takes to protect themselves.","There has been unease in the SouthWest with killings and kidnappings believed to be carried out by Fulani herdsmen. While the Ondo state governor, Rotimi Akeredolu, issued an ultimatum for herders to leave the state’s forest reserves, the Oyo state governor, Seyi Makinde, said issuing an ultimatum is an assault on the herders. However, a man named Sunday Adeyemo, popularly known as Sunday Igboho, led youths to attack a Fulani settlement in Igangan in Ibarapa North Local Government Area of Oyo State after his seven-day ultimatum for them to leave Igangan expired. It is believed that the community knows those behind the killings and kidnappings. This attack defied governor Makinde’s order to make every law-abiding resident feel safe. Reacting to this, President Muhammadu Buhari’s senior special assistant on media and publicity, Garba Shehu, said the Inspector General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, has ordered Mr Igboho’s arrest. In the light of this development, a  news report published by the Peoples Gazette on January 22, 2020, claims the Alaafin of Oyo, Lamidi Adeyemi, wrote to President Muhammadu Buhari that the Yorubas have what it takes to protect themselves. The Peoples Gazette also published this on it its Facebook account which has over 38,000 followers.  This letter was also shared by Dele Momodu, publisher of Ovation Magazine which also shared this on its Facebook page.  Dubawa conducted a keyword search which led to similar reports by the Eagles Online on January 21, 2021, and the Guardian on January 22, 2021.  This search also led to similar reports in 2019 where the Alaafin wrote to the president on insecurity issues. One report by Premium Times on July 22, 2019, noted that the Alaafin of Oyo wrote to the president on herders’ invasion and other insecurity issues in the west. According to Premium Times, this letter was titled “Yoruba Question in Nigeria Conundrum”. The Cable in July 2019 published a similar report. Dubawa got a copy of the letter in circulation and studied it in comparison with that issued in 2019. Dubawa noticed similarities in the recent letter and that of 2019 and decided to study it in detail. First Dubawa noted that both letters had the same title “Yoruba Question in Nigeria Conundrum”. Also, both letters from the first paragraph to the last have the same content, word for word. Reaching out to the sources, Dubawa reached the contact available on the Facebook page of the Peoples Gazette to state their source of the letter. The peoples Gazette replied that their report was based on the Guardian’s report. “Thank you. We published the Alaafin’s comments based on this report from The Guardian:https://guardian.ng/news/tackle-insecurity-now-before-its-too-late-alaafin-tells-buhari/.” Dubawa, therefore, went further to reach the Guardian but there has been no response so far. Dubawa also reached out to Mr Momodu via direct message on his Facebook account where the letter was shared and got no response, so far. Dubawa further reached out to the Alaafin’s spokesperson, Bode Durojaiye, for comments on issuing any letter recently to the president.  Mr Durojaiye said the letter was issued as far back as 2018 and is being recirculated by mischievous people. “The open letter was written and widely published as far back as 2018. So the recent recirculation was mischief making,” he said in a telephone conversation. Dubawa’s findings showed these reports are misleading as this letter is a recirculated letter from 2019 in the wake of new security issues in the South West. The Spokesperson to the Alaafin of Oyo also confirmed the letter to be old.

CLAIM 1: P-phenylenediamine (PPD) in hair dye causes head swelling.,"CLAIM 1: P-phenylenediamine (PPD) in hair dye causes head swelling. P-phenylenediamine causes irritation and head swelling. P-phenylenediamine (PPD) is toxic and illegal for skin use. P-phenylenediamine is illegal for skin use but not overall use. Its use is strictly regulated in the European Union and the United States of America. Popular doctor and social media influencer, Dr Chinonso Fidelis Egemba, popularly known as Aproko Doctor, on January 17, 2020 tweeted that p-Phenylenediamine, an ingredient of the widely-used hair dye, is powerful, toxic, and illegal to use on the skin. The tweet which has so far garnered over 10,000 retweets and over 7,000 likes as of Wednesday, January 20, accompanies an image of a white woman with a swollen face and head. The tweet reads: “Before you apply hair dye on your head, please check if PPD (p-Phenylenediamine) is part of the ingredients. “PPD is so powerful and toxic that it is illegal to use it on the skin. This lady had a reaction to PPD and it caused her head to swell. RT for awareness.” In another tweet made public the same day, Dr Egemba added: “Luckily for her, she was treated and her head came back to its normal size. If you’re unsure about a hair dye, apply a small portion on a part of your skin first to see if any reaction can be elicited before proceeding to apply on your scalp. Share this with someone.” Checks by Dubawa shows that hair coloring or hair dyeing – largely used by youths in Nigeria – is the practice of changing the hair color to cover gray or white hair, to change to a color regarded as more fashionable or desirable, or to restore the original hair color after it has been discolored by hairdressing processes or sun bleaching. Checks also revealed that ingredients of hair dyes include ammonia (or ethanolamines in the case of some ammonia-free products), hydrogen peroxide, p-phenylenediamine and henna (an orange dye commonly used as a deposit-only hair color whose active component, lawsone, binds to keratin).  Further checks also revealed that p-phenylenediamine in hair dyes has been reported to have caused allergic reactions, irritation and swelling in some people. A consultant dermatologist with Limi Group of Hospitals, Abuja, Dr Michael Akolawol said skin sensitivity could cause such reactions. “It occurs a lot in people with sensitive skin types. And for those with allergies, you pick your own battle. One or two people are likely to have that effect,” he said. Dr Akolawole with over ten years experience added: “This happened to me. I had white hair when I was young and I used the black dye and my face got swollen. This was before I got to know about the effects. It is called contact dermatitis. “It caused a lot of serious damages. The effect shows mostly outside the skin and not inside. And it shows on the face and the head. When the swelling comes down, the face becomes dark.” Checks by Dubawa reveal that the use of p-phenylenediamine in cosmetic products is not illegal but its direct use on skin is illegal. PPD’s use has been restricted in certain countries largely due to its effects on skin when used disproportionately. Logically, a fact-checking organisation with bases in India, United Kingdom, and the United States reports that PPD can be used lawfully in hair dyes but it is not permitted in cosmetics meant to be applied on the skin. Citing information provided by the US Food and Drug Administration and the UK National Health Service, Logically says PPD is safe and legal to use in permanent hair dyes but temporary tattoos may contain high levels of this chemical dye which is illegal to use on the skin. Even though PPD is not illegal generally, its use on the skin is illegal. Users should be aware that these common dye chemicals are associated with numerous negative health effects. While ammonia is a respiratory and asthma irritant, a potential endocrine disruptor, and is persistent in the environment, meaning it sticks around, PPD is associated with birth defects, skin irritation, liver and blood toxicity, and allergic reaction. It is restricted for use in the European Union. Instead of PPD, Dr Akolawole advised people to use the natural dye made from natural henna dye (laali).

Claim: A viral video clip claims vaccines are targeted at eliminating Africans.,"Claim: A viral video clip claims vaccines are targeted at eliminating Africans. The claim that vaccines are meant to eliminate Africans is false and the statement on vaccines is not related to COVID-19 vaccines.  With the growing spread of misinformation and different theories surrounding the coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine in relation to Africa, a 30-second video going viral on social media claims there is a plan to eliminate Africans through vaccines. In the video, a witness named Dr Robert O. Young who was answering questions from a set of panellists said there were too many people in the world and there was the need to get rid of them starting off in Africa. “For the purpose of sterilization and population control, there is too many people on the planet we need to get rid off in the words of Bill Gate, at least 3billion people need to die. So we will just start off in Africa. We will start doing our research there and we will eliminate most of the Africans because they are deplorable, they are worthless, they are not part of this world economy so they have their rights taken away and they are surpressed and experimented” Excerpt of Dr Robert’s statement. Dubawa researched the witness (Dr Robert O. Young) in the video and discovered that Dr Young is an American naturopathic practitioner and author of alternative medicine books.  Dubawa also conducted a Google reverse image search with screenshots of the video which led to a report on January 13, 2021, by Everyday.ng.  According to this report, the video was filmed at the International Tribunal of Natural Justice (ITNJ) sittings in Bali, Indonesia at the Judicial Commission of Inquiry into the Weaponization of the Biosphere in June 2019. The video has, however, been gaining traction since emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccination.  This report led us to the ITNJ website where we saw different clips of this sitting from different days without finding Dr Young’s statement.  The 10-minute clip of Day one covered the opening introduction of the Bali sitting in June 2019. Day two clip covered ITNJ Trustee Emeritus, Sacha Stone, giving a speech. The link available on the site for the full clip of the seating led to a YouTube video that could not be accessed. Dubawa then went ahead to search for Dr Young’s testimony at the ball seating. Dubawa found a Youtube video of one hour and 38 minutes  that contained Dr. Robert O Young’s testimony. The video was posted on Youtube with a short summary that explained that Dr Young’s statement provides the how and why the state department put him out of business and in jail because of his natural treatment to cure cancer.  Going through the video, Dubawa learnt Dr Young was trying to make the point that the different vaccines given to children in the first six years of their life, from the measles vaccine to the polio vaccine are more poisonous than helpful.  The short clip going viral was trimmed out of the full testimony towards the end of the video, where Dr Young quoting Bill Gate, said these vaccines are meant to kill and reduce the world population. It is, however, noteworthy to note that the claim on depopulation by Dr Young accredited to Bill Gate has been debunked. While the statement in the viral clip is true and taken from the original full video of Dr Young’s testimony, it is not related to COVID-19 vaccines. Dubawa’s findings show that while it is true that Dr Young made such a statement in an original video from the ITNJ seating, his statement was taken out of context as his statement and the seating have no relation with COVID-19. The time of this seating also discredits this video’s connection to COVID-19 which happened 5 months before COVID-19 broke out in December 2019. This makes the claim false and misleading. What he said was just to give an idea of the plans they were taking. You should interview Dr. yourself and follow the case to the later before you can say its false. Why is the video on youtube  deleted. You arguement here lack facts. You guys are so FULL OF SHIT I SMELL YOU FROM HERE!  His talk is about ANY SYNTHETIC MOLECULE introduced to the human body and the COVID death shots are FULL OF SYNTHETICS.   I HOPE YOU ALL DIE SLOW MISERABLE DEATHS AND BURN IN FUCKING HELL FOR ETERNITY Covid 19 did not start in December 2019, Dubawa go and do your research. And it has nothing to do with the timing either. While the statement in the viral clip is true and taken from the original full video of Dr Young’s testimony, it is not related to COVID-19 vaccines. this is supposed to make me feel better?! This is everything to do with COVID because COVID was already preplanned. Even if you read the Bible, the phopecies tell of a one world order and the mark of the beast. This is going to be through vaccines which are currently being mandated. How did all of these prophecies become known over 2000 years ago? So the video of just a few years ago is related to the vaccines, irrespective of what the name of the virus is that the vaccine excuse is made for. The video is genuine! The content is correct. Hi. I’m sorry does it matter what vaccine Young is referring to or if it was related to COVID? Was he joking when he said Africans are worthless and governments can basically experiment on them? Did I miss something? What is ok about any of it? Please help me understand. Look. Take the information false if you want. We here Africans/blaQ people know exactly the issues that go over many African people in the continents heads. The evasiveness really is disappointing. Keep in mind that they will use you first as they did in other experiments because you believe in changing your skin colors, you also have a high regard for Europeans the ones who deceive you ever time. Get real. There is an agenda to murder a majority of the population beginning with mostly dark skinned genetics.

"Claim: A Twitter user, Nnamdi Chife (@NnamdiChife), claimed in a tweet that Anambra state is owing “a combined debt of over N200 Billion”.","On Sunday, January 10, a Twitter user named Nnamdi Chife (@NnamdiChife), claimed in a tweet that has since gone viral that the Anambra state government is owing a combined debt of over ₦200 billion. Chief further alleged that former governor of Anambra state, Peter Obi, left ₦72 billion in cash and $150 million in Anambra Generational Fund for Willie Obiano, the current governor. He also implied that all what the former governor left had been squandered. To verify this claim, Legit.ng first reached out to Nnamdi Chife to understand the source(s) of his allegation. Responding, Chife cited the Debt Management Office (DMO) as the source of his information. Thus, Legit.ng contacted the DMO’s portal for relevant information regarding Anambra state government’s debt. According to the domestic debt data for the 36 states of the federation and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) published by the DMO as at September 30, 2020, Anambra State is owing ₦59,013,845,976.50 (₦59.0 billion).  Regarding the external debt, the DMO’s debt data as at 30th June, 2020, indicates that Anambra is owing $115,886,392.46 ($115.886 million). The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN)’s official exchange rate of dollar to naira, as of June 30 when the document was released, was about ₦360. At this rate, $115.886 million equals ₦41,718,960,000 (₦41.7 billion). The combined debt owed by the state government, that is both domestic and external, amounts to ₦100,732,805,976.5 (₦100.7 billion). From the above, the total debt owed by Anambra state government is ₦100.7 billion. Where did Chife get his “over 200 billion” debt figure from? He told Legit.ng: “The DMO’s balance doesn’t include the ACCESS BANK N50B loan for airport project at Aguleri, Anambra State.” “The Access Bank facility is an insider information. The loan is collateralized (viz) with Anambra USD Generation Fund that was set up in the then Diamond Bank.” To verify this allegation, Legit.ng checked the Anambra state government’s website for any relevant document. According to a document on the portal tagged Anambra Debt Sustainability Analysis and dated December 31, 2020, the state government indicates it is owing a total of N85.197 billion outstanding debt: N40.561bn external, N44.636bn domestic. Though there is no evidence to back up the alleged new Access Bank loan, if the N50 billion is added to the official debt owed by the Anambra state government, either the DMO figure (N102.9 billion) or the one on the state government’s website (N85.197 billion), the total figure will still be far away from “over N200 billion” claim. Based on these findings, the claim that the Anambra state government owes over ₦200bn debt is false. Claim 2: Former Governor Peter Obi handed over ₦72 billion in cash and $150 million to Governor Willie Obiano which have all been “frittered away” About a year after, 2015, the Secretary to the Anambra state government, Prof Solo Chukwulobelu, granted a press conference to address an allegation that Peter Obi left ₦75 billion for his successor. Chukwulobelu described Obi’s claim as a hoax, according to a Vanguard report. “The N75 billion was not there; it was not handed over to anybody. At best it can be half truth”  Chukwulobelu said instead, the state government inherited a total contract sum of N185.1 billion as liability from the Obi administration. “In the real sense, what the Obiano administration inherited from Obi was N9billion cash and 26 Billion near cash.” However, reacting to Chukwulobelu’s claim, Obi’s media aide, Valentine Obienyem, clarified that Obi left “over N75 Billion in cash and investment”; not in cash alone. According to Obienyem, ₦27 billion was in local currency investment; ₦26.5 billion in foreign currency investment and ₦28.1 billion in Certified State/ MDS balances. In a 2018 interview with The Sheet TV, Obi revisited the issue. He said he left for Obiano local and foreign cash and investments in shares and bonds worth ₦75 billion. Breaking down the ₦75 billion, Obi said he left about ₦30 billion in the bank. In foreign currency, he said left a total of about $156 million. The former governor added that he left investments worth ₦25 billion. CBN’s dollar/naira exchange rate in March 2014 when Obi handed over was about $1/₦155. At this rate, the $156 million the former governor claimed he left was about ₦24,180,000,000 (₦24.1 billion). Added to the alleged ₦30 billion, the total amount the governor claimed to have left in cash (both Naira and Dollar) would be about ₦54 billion. Beyond the claims and counter-claims (with varying figures) made by Obi and the Obiano government, Legit.ng cannot find any publicly available data to verify the actual amount left by the former governor for his successor. Nevertheless, findings above indicate that the claim that Obi left “N72 Billion in cash” and “$150 million in Anambra Generational Fund” is mostly false.

"Claim: a certain web-based message going round on WhatsApp claims that the Federal Government is offering  N10,500 weekly as COVID-19 second wave grants.","When it became evident that the only way to curtail the spread of COVID-19 was through social distancing, the need for lockdown became paramount. Though a good precautionary step towards curtailing the virus, the action came with diverse difficulties, chiefly amongst such issues meant jobs had to be worked out from home. This also implies that persons whose jobs demanded presence would have to stay idle and jobless; which meant no salaries and income for the duration of the lockdown.  Courtesy of this reality, most countries supplied palliatives and cash support in order to support those whose jobs or businesses were affected by the lockdown. For fact-checkers, however, this reality came with a new challenge as multiple fraudsters capitalized on this narrative to infiltrate unsuspecting members of the public into falling victims of their ruse schemes. Even worse,  multiple websites that claimed to offer palliatives were confirmed by DUBAWA to be phishing sites for boosting adverts or data collecting sites for financial fraud.   In Nigeria, these schemes became prevalent on the social media space, even months ago, Information circulated across social media platforms,  illustrated through a link web message, claiming that  Nigeria’s Federal Government has approved to disburse 30,000 to citizens as COVID-19 lockdown funds. Though DUBAWA had debunked the information, many people had already fallen victim to the scheme mostly for how it appeared convincing, and how wide it circulated.  Courtesy of this identified avalanche of pre-existing schemes in the guise of providing COVID-19 palliative, DUBAWA    subjects similar websites to scrutiny. To identify its verity, as some may not be deceitful. In this case, a certain web-based message making rounds on Whatsapp, claims that the Federal Government of Nigeria is offering N10, 500 weekly as grants for  COVID-19 second wave in the country.  The link has been shared and forwarded multiple times on WhatsApp and when opened at the first stage; the user is welcomed with this notice: “All Nigrian Citizens are Entitled to N10,500 per week to stay at Home in a bid to control the spreed of COVID19 Second Wave, Proceed Now To Apply By Filling The Provided Form and Choose Your Preffered Payment Method, Your Account Will Be Credited As Soon As Possible.👇👇👇” On the same page, the user is required to type in name and phone number.  Designed with the emblem of the Federal Government of Nigeria and the picture of Sadiya Umar Faraouk, the minister of humanitarian affairs, disaster management, and social development, the page also contained acclaimed testimonial comments of persons who have benefited from the grants.  As a procedure to access the said grant, the user is also expected to answer three questions: “what is your employment status; what is your marital status and what is your age range?” After answering the questions,  the user is obliged to  also invite friends/groups up to  a certain maximum number indicated by a bar on the page before accessing the withdrawal Code. Nonetheless, as regards prior instances where DUBAWA had to verify similar claims, the case under study becomes also pertinent to be subjected to further scrutiny and analysis.  To confirm the veracity of the claim, DUBAWA reached out to the Spokesperson,  ministry of humanitarian affairs, disaster management, and social development via a phone call.  With stern clarity, she said that the information is false and the link/website in question is fraudulent. Further advised members of the public to be wary of such websites pledging COVID-19 grants. In her actual words, the spokesperson clarified that “the information is false and the link is fraudulent.  I will advise members of the public to stay off such sites promising COVID-19 grants and palliatives. If the ministry will give grants, it will do so using the appropriate channel.” Other red flags identified in the claim are the prevalent errors in spellings.  Nigeria was misspelt as “Nigrian” spread was misspelt as “spreed” and preferred was spelt as “preferred“. Even more, the whole paragraph is a grammatical blunder as uppercases alphabets are assigned to words carelessly.   Furthermore,  even after completing the said procedure, the user is still not offered the said grants. Even more, an analysis of the link on ScamDoc reveals that the domain name is very recent (less than 6 months) with a short life expectancy that is linked to one or more countries known for being used by fraudulent websites. The claim that the Federal Government is offering N10,500 weekly as COVID-19 second wave grants is, therefore, false, misleading, and fraudulent.

"Claim: The Nigerian military recently raided an enclave of Boko Haram terrorists inside the Sambisa Forest, seizing ammunition and religious books and burning the structures.","A Twitter user, LMAN (@L_man__), shared four pictures on Friday, Jan. 15, and suggested they showed the aftermath of a recent military onslaught against Boko Haram camps in the Sambisa Forest area. The pictures included an aerial view of burning structures as well as shots of religious books and ammunition seized from insurgents. “Boko Haram have abandoned one of their Sambisa enclaves under the superior power of Nigeria’s military,” LMAN captioned them. The post coincided with the celebration of the Armed Forces Remembrance Day, set aside to mark the end of the Nigerian civil war which lasted two and a half years from 1967 to Jan. 15, 1970, as well as Nigeria’s participation in global military operations. A day after LMAN’s tweet, another Twitter user, AGGN (@haruna_braimoh), shared three of the pictures and a fifth one, explicitly claiming they were taken recently. “Shekau was here 2021. Yeye. Bullet keel you.!! This is inside the Sambisa Forest and the inners of the BH leader!! May Allah strengthen the Nigeria military & allied forces to do the needful finally to finish this business successfully,” he wrote. LMAN and AGGF’s tweets were respectively liked by over 1,200 and 417 users of the microblogging platform as of 8 a.m. on Sunday, Jan. 17. They were cumulatively shared 673 times. Using the reverse image search tool, TinEye, HumAngle found that the aerial shot of a burning building located in a desertland first appeared on the internet in March 2008. In a 2009 publication by the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, the picture was captioned as “the burning of Um Ziefa in Darfur, Sudan,” dated Dec. 12, 2004, and credited to Brian Steidle, a photographer for the museum. Over 3,300 villages were damaged or destroyed mostly between 2003 and 2005 in the Darfur region “during the height of the brutal Sudanese government-backed campaign targeting civilians,” the museum noted.  The other four pictures were traced back to a post from Jan. 31, 2018, shared on Facebook by the Nigerian Army’s former Director of Public Relations, Brig.-Gen.  Sani Kukasheka Usman (rtd). He had uploaded a total of 24 pictures alongside a statement explaining that troops of Operation Lafiya Dole, under Operation Deep Punch II, had cleared Camp Zairo the previous day and recovered battle tanks among other items. “Yesterday, Tuesday 30th January 2018, the advancing troops had contact with Boko Haram terrorists and engagement ensued,” the general wrote.  He added: “During the encounter, they were able to recover an Eagle Main Battle Tank (EMBT), 1 VBL, 1 AK-47 Rifle, a Police Teargas Rifle, religious books, many gas cylinders and bags of fertiliser, ostensibly for Improvised Explosives Devices making.  “Other items destroyed by the gallant troops include 7 Gun trucks, 4 Trucks, 5 Hilux, 1 Prado Jeep, 1 Golf car, 4 Mitsubishi pick up, 1 Hiace bus, several Motorcycles, makeshift shelters, tentages  and household items.” The pictures were subsequently included in publications on various news platforms and blogs. Located in Borno State, Camp Zairo (Zero) was formerly the command and control centre of Boko Haram. It was established as a military training facility under the administration of Gen. Ibrahim Babangida but was later abandoned after public outcry. The terror group had then taken over the facility and converted the area to a training ground.  All the pictures are not recent and have been used in a misleading context. One of the photos is from the infamous Darfur genocide in Sudan that led to the killing of hundreds of thousands of people. Other pictures are from Nigeria but show a military raid that took place in January 2018. ",2018,19/01/2021,https://dubawa.org/old-foreign-photos-recycled-as-recent-military-raid-of-terrorist-camp/
"Claim: a viral WhatsApp message claims that the Registrar, Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University (ATBU), advised that female students should go and marry while male students should go learn handwork as school resumption appears to blink.","COVID-19 has no doubt taken an enormous toll on almost every aspect of human life. In Nigeria, one issue that has remained on the news waves is the actual resumption dates for schools.  Due to the unprecedented nature of the current situation, schools are overwhelmed by the steps to take in order to prevent the spread of the virus.  For secondary and primary schools within the country, the situation would appear bearable since they’ve resumed in the last quarter of 2020 and had some experience in managing themselves amidst the pandemic. Nonetheless, the predicament is totally new for government universities that were closed down due to the ASUU strike throughout the wave of the pandemic in 2020.  Now that the strike has been called off,   resumption will appear a gigantic charter for them to undertake owing to the required adequate planning and precautions that will be needed to put in place before resuming. It is amidst this dilemma that multiple claims as regards the resumption of government universities, continues to erupt in the social sphere without a basis to dub it as a lie or enough evidence to base it as the truth.   A similar case is a viral WhatsApp message making rounds as a circular. The message claims that the Registrar,  Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University, Bauchi is advising all female students to marry while male students should go and find handwork.  Consequently, the first and second paragraph of the circular debunked an existing rumor about the school’s resumption on January 18th, 2020, while the major claim concerning the students came as the last paragraph and read: “Students and the general public are hereby advised that all the male genders should go and learn handwork and the female genders should as well start getting married. We MOVE!!!” Considering the delay and setbacks, students of government universities have faced due to the ASUU strike and the prevailing pandemic. The claim under scrutiny is sensitive enough to arouse diverse feelings amongst students. Thus, DUBAWA subjects the case under study to uncover its veracity.  When DUBAWA reached out to the institution connected to the claim, the Public Relations Officer of the University, Abdulkadir Shehu, noted via a text message that the circular was false and misleading. He added that just last week the university had to debunk similar claims about its resumption.  The text reads, “the circular is fake, and it’s not from us. We respect our students and uphold the need for education amongst both genders.” As regards resumption, he added that “Last week we debunked a similar case concerning resumption.  When you talk about ATBU and resumption whether ASUU is satisfied, I can tell you that we have yet to see any tangible improvement, whether in hostel accommodation,  classrooms, and other things needed for COVID-19  protocols. As such, the resumption of students of the institution is yet to be announced.”   Noticeably, the lingering circular contains an informal phrase that is very unlikely to be found present in an official circular of a reputable university. The phrase “WE MOVE!!!” Was popularly used during the EndSARS protest as part of the slogan. To be found present in this same circular raises a red flag.  The circular purportedly from the registrar of Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University (ATBU), advising female students to go and marry while male should go learn handwork as school resumption appears to blink is false.

A viral WhatsApp message claims sending “I do not authorise” WhatsApp new policy to ten WhatsApp groups exempts you from the policy.,"A viral WhatsApp message claims sending “I do not authorise” WhatsApp new policy to ten WhatsApp groups exempts you from the policy. False. Full Text  In January, WhatsApp began notifying Its users of an update in its terms of service and privacy policy. The notification sent out to both Android and iOS users read, “By tapping Agree, you accept the new terms and privacy policy, which take effect on 8 February 2021. After this date, you’ll need to accept these updates to continue using WhatsApp.” There has been public confusion on what this new policy is about with misinformation spreading on this policy and what it means for the user.  One section of the policy that raises concern among users is that user data is collected and shared with Facebook. The confusion surrounding the update has contributed to a mass of users moving to competing apps like Signal. According to a report by CNN Signal had about 7.5 million installations globally from the App Store and Google Play within three days. Quoting market intelligence firm Sensor Tower, this is more than 43 times the installations it received during the previous week. This led to a delay in the update of the policy. On Friday, January 15, 2021, Whatsapp announced moving back the update deadline from February 8, 2021, to May 15, 2021. Following this, a WhatsApp message going viral claims tomorrow begins the new WhatsApp rule, noting today is the deadline with no specific dates for “tomorrow” or “today”. First observation Dubawa noticed was the error in the spelling of WhatsApp as Whatsap all through the viral message.  Claim 1: Today is the deadline for WhatsApp’s new rule, new rule begins tomorrow. The viral WhatsApp message claims the deadline is today with no specific date for today. This could mean anyway depending on when the message is shared or when the message gets to a user. For Example, Dubawa got the message on Sunday, January 17, 2021which then means the “new rule” begins Monday, January 18, 2021.  This is false as the update sent to users by WhatsApp on January 4, 2021, noted users had to accept the policy by February 8, 2021, or lose access to their accounts. Also, a new update moved up the deadline to May 15, 2021.  Claim 2: Everything posted can be published. This claim is false as WhatsApp has clearly stated it protects and secures personal messages and that the changes are related to optional business features on the app. According to WhatsApp, they can’t see your personal messages or hear your calls and neither can Facebook, they don’t keep logs of who everyone is messaging or calling, they can’t see your shared location and neither can Facebook, they don’t share your contacts with Facebook, groups remain private, you can set your messages to disappear, and you can download your data to see what information WhatsApp has on your account right from within the app. “We want to be clear that the policy update does not affect the privacy of your messages with friends or family in any way. The changes are related to optional business features on WhatsApp, and provides further transparency about how we collect and use data”. Excerpt of WhatsApp’s response to privacy policy questions. WhatsApp also noted that the new changes are to support over 175 million people who message a business account every day by enabling customer service to address questions or enquiries, discovering businesses through adverts on Facebook and Instagram, better shopping experiences so people with businesses on Facebook and Instagram can also expand to WhatsApp. Claim 3: Sending “I DO NOT AUTHORIZE” to ten WhatsApp groups protects your account from the new rule. According to this claim, after sending this to 10 groups, your account will get a tick (✔️) signal that means your account is now protected. This is false as dubawa followed the instruction and nothing appeared on the WhatsApp account. Dubawa also reached out out to WhatsApp Messenger support on this claim but so far no response was received. All claims contained in this viral WhatsApp message are false.

Claim: A viral WhatsApp message claims the incubation period of the new variant of COVID-19 in Nigeria is between 24 to 72 hours.,"Multiple variants of Coronavirus (COVID-19) are spreading globally. In Nigeria, a new variant was reported in August and October, 2020. This subsequently led to new travel guidelines for passengers from the United Kingdom (UK) and South Africa in December 2020. As of Thursday, January 14, 2021, Nigeria recorded 1,398 new cases bringing the total number of cases to 103,999. A viral WhatsApp message claims the incubation period of the new variant of COVID-19 is between 24-72hours. This message, which called for caution and the need to take control measures such as face mask wearing and hand washing serious, was accredited to the Academy of Medicine Specialties of Nigeria. Dubawa at a glance noticed some grammatical errors in the viral WhatsApp message. First is the missing adjective “less than” in the sentence “The incubation period is 24-72 hours than 4 days” that is supposed to qualify the period of time.  Also,  the supposed name of the organisation that the information was referenced to “Academy of Medicine Specialties of Nigeria” could not be found after a thorough search. Dubawa also conducted a keyword search on the new variant in Nigeria and its characteristics. An Incubation period is a time between contraction and the appearance of symptoms of a viral infection. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) in Nigeria, incubation period means the time between catching the virus and manifestation of symptoms of the disease.  The estimated incubation period for most COVID-19 cases ranges from one to 14 days, most commonly around five days. According to a report by Annals of internal medicine, the average incubation period seems to be around 5 days. According to this report, more than 97 percent of people who contract COVID-19 show symptoms within 11.5 days of exposure. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also noted that the incubation period for COVID-19 is between 2-14days. According to the Africa and Nigerian Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), so far there is no evidence that the new variant  in Nigeria is causing more severe illness or increasing the spread of COVID-19 in Nigeria. No evidence to support the claim that the new variant has a lesser incubation period than the normal range of 24 hours to 72 hours. While scientists are working to learn more about these variants to better understand them, there is currently no evidence that these variants cause more severe illness or higher risk of death. The Africa and Nigerian Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have also noted the need for more investigation on this new variant.

Claim: A viral WhatsApp message claims the Italian Ministry of Health has discovered that COIVD-19 is not a virus but a bacteria among several other claims.,"Italy recorded its first two cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) at the end of January 2020 but as of January 7, 2021, Italy had recorded roughly 2.2 million cases of the virus with 571, 055 active cases.  A viral WhatsApp message claims that the Italian Ministry of Health has discovered Coronavirus (COVID-19) to be a bacterium reacting to the 5G radiation not a virus and that it can be treated with antibiotics. The message claims this was discovered when Italy’s Ministry of Health violated the World Health Organization’s law against autopsies on COVID-19 victims. This bacterium is said to cause thrombosis i.e. blood clots in the veins and nerves which leads to death. Dubawa conducted a keyword search on this claim which led to some fact checks done in 2020 by politifact, poynter etc. Dubawa also studied different documents on COVID-19 by WHO. The claim  that Italy violated the WHO law against autopsy is false as there is no instruction or law by the WHO against autopsy on COVID-19 victims. Thrombosis occurs when a thrombus, or blood clot, develops in a blood vessel and reduces the flow of blood through the vessel. The development of a thrombus is what is described as thrombosis. Studies have shown that thrombosis can occur in COVID-19 patients of different age groups. A study titled “Incidence on thrombotic complications in critically ill ICU patients with COVID-19” shows that 31% incidence of thrombotic complications in ICU patients with COVID-19 infections is high. Another study on “Thrombotic Neurovascular disease in COVID-19” patients also suggests this.  Since COVID-19 has been identified as a virus not a bacterium, antibiotics can not be used to  treat it. This is supported by WHO which noted that the only reason you might receive antibiotics during a COVID-19 treatment is if  there is a bacterial co-infection. COVID-19 has no link with the 5G radiation as the WHO organisation has clearly stated that COVID-19 cannot be transmitted via waves/mobile networks and the virus has spread to countries that do not have 5G mobile networks. Claims in the viral WhatsApp message are false and misleading as none of the claims could be linked to Italy’s Ministry of Health. C0VID-19 has also been identified as a virus and there is no WHO law or guideline against autopsy. There is also no link between 5G and COVID-19, neither does antibiotics cure COVID-19.

Claim: A Facebook post claims the WHO is recruiting.,"A Facebook post by Recruitment Trust claims the World Health Organisation is recruiting with a link to access what it described as the “WHO Recruitment 2020 Form and Portal Registration”. The post, made on November 6, 2020, has been recirculated on Facebook. The post by Recruitment Trust has so far generated over 7,000 reactions, 478 comments and 472 shares. Dubawa first observed that the link provided did not contain the organisation’s names like all its official websites do.  Dubawa, however, went ahead to follow the link which led to another page with a pop-up message saying, “Hi! Hey! We’re Hiring Now! Are you looking for a job?” This message also gives two options to answer Yes or No. After closing the pop-up message, different jobs were listed at different points from August 19, 2020, to January 8. Positions listed include: National consultant, programme management officer, external relations/resources mobilization (EXR) officer, etc. When Dubawa visited the page again using the same link, an error message was displayed, saying it was a bad gateway. This also questions the credibility of the site. Dubawa also reached out to its partners at the WHO who denied having anything to do with such recruitment or the website.  “We have no relation with this website,” the organisation said. The claim that the WHO is recruiting is false and misleading as the organisation has denied any recruitment activity and distanced itself from the website that made the claim.

"Claim: A Facebook Loan Service, claiming to be a Guaranty Trust Bank Facebook account, claims a url link for followers and interested persons to click, to access a loan.","As fraudulent activities keep rising on Social Media platforms, Facebook remains one of the main platforms that perpetrators of such evil acts use to fish for victims, even as the Guaranty Trust Bank (GTB) is not left out of the scheme. Recently on Facebook, a claim surfaced from an acclaimed GTB loan service account with a URL for its victims to click. The URL, when clicked, can give the scammers access to the victims’ contacts including bank details. But is this Facebook page truly from GTBank? Does GTBank operate loans on social media platforms? Dubawa spoke with a representative of the Guarantee Trust Bank to verify the Facebook page and the customer care representative, Ms Goodness after viewing the Facebook page, said the page does not emanate from GTBank.  “This is not from us. We do not have a loan app. Please do not give out your card details,” Ms Goodness said. She noted that: “Our Facebook page is verified with a blue tick. No bank will ask you to provide your card pin.” Another red flag detected is that the fake Facebook page indicated a URL to be clicked by loan applicants, which, according to the Customer Care Representative spoken with, is never a link to GTBank loan. The Facebook Loan Service account and acclaimed link do not belong to Guaranty Trust Bank. All Banks, according to Ms Goodness, have verified social media handles and verified email addresses for complaint and request as this. Hence, the Bank has no affiliation with such a page.

Claim: A set of 661 pump action rifles donated by the French government and destined for Boko Haram terrorist camps was intercepted by the Nigeria Customs Service.,"A Twitter account, LA America (@LavinyAsocUSA), on Tuesday shared two pictures of firearms. It claimed that they are weapons funded by France and planned to be acquired by Boko Haram terrorists. “Container full of weapons held by Nigeria’s customs office destined for Boko Haram by France. Weapons intercepted by Nigeria customs for Boko Haram supplied by France, concealed in a container with the name of an NGO,” the account wrote. A similar claim was made the previous day, January 4, by a different Twitter user. “Ammunition from France concealed in containers with food said to be meant for IDPs in Borno State. Some Customs officials insisted on a thorough check and they found arms and ammunition concealed for humanitarian aid delivery,” Yusha Abdul (@yusha_abdul) wrote in a tweet where he attached an additional picture of the scene. “Boko Haram is not about Islam or Muslims and it doesn’t represent either. It is more of economics and politics. May God continue to expose them and make our country safe. Amin.” Abdul has over 12,100 followers on the microblogging platform. His tweet was liked by 45 people and shared a total of 37 times as of midday, January 6. “We believe France and other humanitarian workers help insurgency and terrorism in Nigeria and other West African countries. Last month more than 150 Niger military men were killed and Niger government suspecting France of masterminding the attack. So we must stop them,” one person commented. Another wrote in a quote retweet, “France is one of our major problems in Nigeria And Africa. We cannot divorce our security challenges from the French and the United States. But when we explain, politically ignorant people call us conspiratorial theorists.” It is not the first time this claim would be spread on social media. In December 2019, the Global Pan-Africanism Network (GPAN) shared the same set of three pictures and blamed France for attempting to send the firearms to the Boko Haram terrorist group.  “Weapons arrested by the customs of Nigeria destined for Boko Haram provided by France, hidden in a container with the name of an NGO,” the organisation’s Twitter account wrote. The tweet was liked by 472 users of the platform and shared over 380 times. Around the same period, Savn Daniel (@savndaniel) shared a now-deleted tweet with the same pictures and claim. The claim has also circulated in French among nationals of Mali but was slightly edited to say the weapons were bound for Kidal in northern Mali. According to other claims, the weapons were seized in Ivory Coast or Burkina Faso. A reverse image search done using TinEye revealed that the pictures date back to May 23, 2017. One of the earliest publications containing the pictures is a report by Legit Newspaper, which stated that a container loaded with arms was intercepted by officers of the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) in Lagos. In a post shared through its verified Facebook account on the same day, NCS shared five pictures of the interception, which it said was of 440 pump action rifles and other items concealed with POP cement. This contradicts Yusha Abdul’s claim that the firearms were kept inside foodstuff. Seized items from the truck included 100 pieces of Black Tornado single barrel rifles, 75 pieces of silver magnum single barrel rifles, 50 pieces of alter pump action rifles, 215 pieces of black single barrel rifles, 516 50kg bags of POP (Plaster of Paris) cement, and so on. “Answering questions from the media on the circumstance surrounding the seizure, the Customs Area Controller hinted that the importer declared the consignment as Antisera and Cannule (chemical formula),” the NCS said in its statement. “Speaking further on the status of the seizure, the Customs Area Controller stated that investigation is still ongoing with a view to unravelling those behind the importation and that further profiling of the importer will be carried out to get other details.” The government agency further revealed that it had arrested one person in connection with the illegal importation and stated that the guns originated from Turkey.  Earlier and later that year, other batches of 661 and 1,100 pump action rifles were similarly imported from Turkey through false declaration.  The NCS neither linked the firearms to the French government nor Boko Haram. Five of the smugglers responsible for importing 661 in January 2017, Mahmud Hassan, Oscar Okafor, Donatus Achinulo, Matthew Okoye, said to be at large, and Salihu Danjuma, were charged with conspiracy, importation of prohibited firearms, forgery, altering of documents, and bribery.  They were not charged under the 2011 Terrorism Prevention Act which prohibits support for terrorist organisations, including “the offer of material assistance, weapons, including chemical or nuclear weapons, explosives, transportation, false documentation or identification.” The rifles and other seized objects were shipped from Turkey and not France, and there is no evidence suggesting that they were intended for Boko Haram terrorists.

CLAIM: A viral meme claims that doctors have encouraged that the COVID-19 vaccine be administered in the penis for men.,"CLAIM: A viral meme claims that doctors have encouraged that the COVID-19 vaccine be administered in the penis for men. The claim is false and misleading. Dubawa found the meme to be a hoax and all directives for the administration of COVID-19 vaccine are on the arm. With the progress made in the development and approval of COVID-19 vaccine comes a growing spread of misinformation around the vaccine. Recently, a meme going viral on social media containing the image of a doctor and a sketch showing an injection in the penile area claims that doctors are recommending that the COVID-19 vaccine be administered in the penis for men. This meme shared by some Facebook users claims doctors are discovering that for men, the penis allows for faster release of the vaccine into the body. This is attributed to findings from a University of California’s study involving 1500 men who received the vaccine.  The meme carries Cable News Network (CNN) logo to give an impression that it is a CNN report. Dubawa conducted a search to find a CNN report on COVID-19 vaccine as it relates to being administered on the penis but found none.  Dubawa also observed clear differences in the format used in the meme and the format used by CNN news. While an ideal CNN report will have its logo, the names of different countries, its Live Tv redpoint icon, edition, the search icon, a contact icon where you can log in or create an account with CNN, and the three-line icon that allows you to open the menu, all on the menu bar, the meme on the other hand which tried to replicate CNN report contained only the CNN logo, Live Tv icon, the contact icon and the three-line open menu icon. The meme’s report also did not contain a byline or dateline. Dubawa also tried to find the said study by a California university on COVID-19 vaccination in the penis but found none. Dubawa, therefore, went ahead to do a google reverse image search for both images contained in the meme.  The reverse image search for the Doctor image led to the page of Biote Medical which identified the person in the image as Dr. Mohitkumar Ardeshana one of its practitioners who completed his Internal Medicine residency at Coney Island Hospital, Brooklyn, New York. The image search for the second image however, did not yield any useful result. According to the standing orders for administering the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine which has been approved by the World Health Organisation (WHO), all vaccines for male and female of any body weight is to be administered in the deltoid muscle of the arm. Similarly, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Moderna vaccine which has been approved by te United State (US), Canada and Isreal, is to be applied in the deltoid muscle. The claim that doctors are encouraging the administration of COVID-19 vaccine in the penis is false and misleading. Dubawa found the meme is a hoax as the meme was created by trying to clone  the news organisation CNN and all administration directives for approved COVID-19 vaccine so far are for the deltoid muscle found in the arm.

Claim: A Facebook post claims NCC is issuing free data and airtime bonus to customers for linking their NIN to their SIM cards.,"A Facebook post shared on December 23, 2020, claims the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has started issuing free data of 25GB and N10,000 worth of airtime to customers who have linked their National Identification Number (NIN) with their  SIM cards. This message described this as the NIN vs SIM promo. The message also noted that this bonus is applicable to all Telecommunications companies in Nigeria. The message also provided steps and a link to check if you are qualified or not and a phone number (0803001001) for viewers to call for more information.  According to the message, this promo ends four weeks after the release of the information that is January 20, 2021.  Dubawa first of all followed the link provided in the Facebook post which led to a page called injustshare.com.ng. Going through the page and the instruction laid out, the first step was to click on a link where you are to carry out step two, which is to add your Facebook account so it can be linked. After this, step three says you have to recharge N100 within 24 hours of linking your Facebook account before you get your free airtime and data.  However, clicking on the link in step one led to a page flagged dangerous and deceptive. Dubawa also called the number made available in the facebook message but was unable to reach the number. Dubawa went further to study the Facebook page that claims to be NCC and noticed that even though this page has been in existence and sharing posts since 2017, its content has nothing related to the official activities of the commission. Its contents are more of motivational stories and quotes, links to WhatsApp groups to join to make money and crypto currency related information.  It also lacks basic information like the link to the commission’s site, active hours, it’s office address, check ins, and direction like the official NCC Facebook page and Twitter page has. The link provided as the commission’s site link leads to the same Ijustshareit.net page. This said NCC page also has just 150 followers unlike the official page with over 190,000 followers. Dubawa also reached out to NCC on Twitter and on its website to get a reaction to this claim but so far, there have been no response. The claim by the Facebook page claiming to be NCC is false and misleading as Dubawa’s analysis of the page shows it is not related to the NCC and the link contained in the message is a deceptive site.

Claim: Nigeria has the second highest paternity fraud rate in the world at 30%,"In recent time, conversations around paternity and paternity fraud have been dominant in Nigerian media space following a recent incident. An Instagram post by Goldmynetv has it that The Managing Director of First City Monument Bank (FCMB), Adamu Nuru, was having an affair with a married junior staff -Moyo Thomas- who recently relocated to Canada with her two children. It was reported that she confessed to her husband, Tunde Thomas, that her FCMB boss is the biological father of their two kids while in the US. In consequence of this confession, Tunde, allegedly, lost his life. The controversy around this incident has brought the issue of paternity fraud (when a man is incorrectly identified to be the biological father of a child).  In reaction to the story, Twitter users have circulated a post suggesting that Jamaica has the highest rate of Paternity Fraud in the world at 34.6% next to Nigeria which allegedly ranks second at 30%. This particular post, published by @ayanfeOfGod, has amassed over 300 Retweets and 586 Likes but it’s just one out of the many other handles that published the claim. To verify the claims of the widely shared presentation, Dubawa’s first point of contact was the Twitter User, @AyanfeOfGod, who published it on Saturday. While we asked how he got the image, he referred us to a July 29th, 2020 Post by Juan Pedrito who in his tweet, at the time, suggested that the image had been in circulation even before then as he mentioned that he brought back the post. Further, Dubawa conducted a Reverse Image Search which reveals that this presentation was first published in 2017. Interestingly, on checking the profile, the source turned out to be Twitter User, Juan Pedrito, again. Dubawa quickly sent him a direct message asking him where he got the image. He replied, saying he took the picture of the presentation “during a lecture at UWI Mona” – The University of the West Indies at Mona, Jamaica. Further questions as regarding the source the statistics sent to him have not been responded to at the time this check was published. While waiting for Juan’s response, a keyword search on paternity fraud in Nigeria was carried out. The search produced the following results: Pulse.ng (2018), Vanguard (2019) and Thisdaylive.com (2018) and Jamaica Observer (2020).  While Pulse Nigeria in its reports passed off the statistics as bluffs, it also suggested that the controversial statistic could have been triggered by the “infamous Durex survey that crowned Nigerian women the most unfaithful in the world.”  Recall, in 2012, Channels Tv published a  survey conducted by condom manufacturer, Durex, in which 29,000 people in 36 countries were interviewed and Nigerian women were ranked the most unfaithful in the world. The Vanguard highlighted that a doctor, Mr Ayodele Ayodeji of Paternity Test Nigeria, a Deoxyribonucleic Acid, DNA, test centre in Lagos, affirmed the claims of the presentation after it went viral in late 2018. Mr Ayodele purportedly said that there is one case of paternity fraud out of every four paternity test conducted at the centre. Conversely, the publication by ThisDay claimed that 3 out of 10 children in Nigeria have non-biological fathers. This article also inferred that Nigerians don’t go for the test as there is a dearth of laboratory facilities in the country and many citizens can’t afford it. Dubawa was forced to ask, how did they arrive at the initial statistics. “It is no longer news that paternity fraud in Nigeria is the second highest in the world with three out of 10 children said to have non-biological fathers. But what seems most worrisome is that there is typically little possibility to verify biological fatherhood with the dearth of laboratory facilities in the country for testing; and where it exists, only the few rich Nigerians can afford it.” Jamaica Observer cited Nigeria as the African country with the most paternity fraud in the world (contrary to the second position widely attributed to the country)  and wondered if the Jamaicans culprits descended from Nigeria. It wrote: “Paternity fraud is a widespread problem in Jamaica, and one may speculate that it could be related to the ethnicity of the perpetrator, since the African country of Nigeria is said to be the world’s nation with the highest numbers of paternity fraud. While such fraud is present in all ethnicities, one may wonder if most Jamaican women who give jackets are of Nigerian descent.” Dubawa reached out to the author of this article, Dudley McLean. When Dudley was asked to identify his source, he referred to a publication on thenigerialawyer.com which has the same reference as this report from PulseNG. The two reports made reference to the statement made by Mr Abasi Ene-Obong, CEO and Co-founder of Stack Diagnostics during an interview with Pulse. While Pulse had asked Mr Abasi if the statistics which puts Nigeria as the country with the second-highest paternity fraud rate in the world can be considered as fake news, he said: “it isn’t fake news but at the same time, the only way we can know for sure is if an independent study is done that seeks to eliminate sampling biases. In other words, the only study we have about this phenomenon puts it at 3 out of 10, so to a large extent that is factual. An independent study that shows us less or more will also be factual and will dispel the 30% number.” Also, in the same interview, Mr Abasi gave reasons why the data can not be passed as a ‘gospel truth’. He said,  “As with most health-based statistics in Nigeria, they are either under-reported or exaggerated because the problem typically lies in how the sample is collected. It is possible that there was some sampling bias to this 30% number but even for sampling biases, that number is quite high.” While all these reports have referred directly and indirectly to the 30% statistics, they all failed to give details (who, where and when the survey was carried out) about the survey that arrived at the conclusion. A fact check conducted by Africa Check revealed that there has not been any national survey on “paternity fraud” in Nigeria. This explains why many reports that have quoted the popular statistics have failed to reference a source. The check featured comments from Chris Olashunde, the Nigeria representative for UK-based DNA testing firm EasyDNA UK. He said there wasn’t data on paternity fraud in Nigeria because it was “a personal thing”.  By personal, he meant most of the paternity tests carried out in the country are done due to mistrust or to resolve conflict, or for immigration purposes.  He concluded that there was no data to prove the claim that paternity fraud in Nigeria is 30%. “I cannot say whether or not it’s up to 30% because there is no data to prove that in Nigeria. The best you can find is the rate of failure of paternity tests at DNA testing centres.” This fact check also featured comments from Mr Ayodele Adeniyi who said the “claim that three out of 10 Nigerian men are not the father of their children is correct if we are considering only those who have done paternity testing” This takes us back to a 2012  interview where the statistics is likely to have originated from. In 2012 Daily Post published an interview with an unidentified doctor who said, without reference to any particular study, that available statistics show “that 3 out of every 10 men are not the fathers of their babies. Similarly, 3 out of every 10 children are not fathered by men they have seen as their biological fathers. He also gave the global statistics: “The general statistics by the American Association of Blood Banks (AABB)/ is that globally, 100, 000 out of 300, 000 men are not the actual fathers of their presumed children.” Dubawa sent an email to AABB, asking them to confirm the claim but they are yet to respond. However, we found a publication on childsupportanalysis.co.uk speaking to paternity issues. The article, when referring to paternity tests says they don’t show paternity frauds. Why? The website stated that paternity tests don’t show paternity fraud because ‘they were not designed for that purpose and statistics typically have to be designed for a purpose in order to be reliable for that purpose.’ The website also shows where AABB had announced misinterpretations of its data, hence, published a note on the MISCONCEPTIONS IN PARENTAGE TESTING in its 2004 annual reports. The American Association of Blood Banks annually publishes consolidated statistics from many accredited paternity testing services. However. The body has announced that its data has been misinterpreted in the past, hence, conveyed the essence of the exclusion rate.  “It is important to understand the significance of the exclusion rate, especially since the statistic has been misinterpreted in the past. For example, several organizations have used the exclusion rate to suggest improperly that 30% of men are misled into believing they are biological fathers of children. This suggestion is incorrect. The exclusion rate includes a number of factors….” The claim that Nigeria is a country with the second highest paternity fraud rate in the world is False as there has not been any national survey of “paternity fraud” in Nigeria. Besides this, there are other red flags to suggest the statistics were baseless. First, the presentation conveying these statistics fails to attribute his claims to any credible source, so as news and articles using the same  reference, hence, it is safe to say the content of the presentation was made up.  It is also important to state that the statistics given in many reports were based on results of paternity tests carried out in individual paternity testing labs (results may vary from lab to lab). They are usually representations of the tested samples and not of the general population of Nigeria.

Claim: A web-based message circulating via a link on WhatsApp claims MTN is offering a 2021 New year customer reward program.,"A certain link circulating on WhatsApp claims to offer MTN 2021 New year Customer reward program. The link which is also a pathway to the acclaimed gift-offering website requires users to check if they have been selected for the Gifts.  The checking procedure requires customers to enter their phone numbers into a space provided to confirm whether they have been selected for the gift. The acclaimed gift includes 50,000 Naira cash for the first 5000 people; 100GB of data for 20000 users, and 10000 Naira worth of airtime for 100000 users. To access these gifts, users are required to click a green button with the WhatsApp insignia, then copy the link offered (the same one under scrutiny) and share it on 12 WhatsApp groups before finally getting the gifts.  As a result, the link has been shared on WhatsApp over 6,789 times. However, in the past, DUBAWA has confirmed similar links offering related services to the public to be fraudulent and deceptive. Thus, the link is subjected to scrutiny to verify its authenticity and the services it claims to offer. Dubawa first contacted MTN Nigeria Customer Service via a phone call to confirm the authenticity of the link and the services it claimed to offer. In response, Saleh Reheema, MTN Customer Service representative said the link in question is fraudulent, only posing as MTN to deceive unsuspecting members of the society.  “People should desist from this link because MTN is currently not offering such services at the moment. This is apparently fraudulent and deceptive,” she said. Furthermore, one major inconsistency traced within the website raised even more red flags. The website claimed that the gifts are only meant for 2,400 selected customers, yet on the same page it’s advertised that   “50,000 naira cash for the first 5,000 people; 100GB of data for 2,0000 users, and 10,000 Naira worth of airtime for 100,000 users.”   Similarly, when the website link was accessed on Scamdoc, the tool gave it a very bad trust score of 1%, implying that the link was recent and known for being used for fraudulent activities. Also, we uncovered the link in question to be a data phishing website. Such sites are usually riddled with installed root pop-up ads that generate traffic through fraudulent schemes; worse still, they engage in the extraction of users’ data and financial details for nefarious purposes.  The information circulating about MTN offering gifts to customers is fraudulent and deceptive. The website is riddled with multiple red flags and inconsistencies including MTN’s  confirmation obtained that the claim is deceitful.

CLAIM: A viral WhatsApp message link claims the WHO is giving out 500 Euros support.,"A link going viral on WhatsApp with the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) logo claims that the WHO is giving out 500 Euros support.  Dubawa opened the link to see what the website holds and followed the instructions. The link, once opened, has a congratulatory message on top which reads, “congratulations you have been selected to benefit from the support provided by the World Health Organization for 500 Euros” After this message comes another instruction that requires one to answer three questions before one can benefit. The first question seeks to know your business type with three options; official, worker, and unemployment.  Any option you pick leads to the second question which seeks to know your marital status with three options; single, married, and divorced.  Similarly, whatever option you pick leads to the third question which seeks to know your age group; 18-30, 30-40 and 40-70. Below these questions on the site are comments by users who claimed to have either received the support fund or gotten the code. After answering all three questions, your answers are reviewed and a pop-up message tells you how much your subsidy amount has been set at and requires you to complete the steps by sharing to five groups or persons on WhatsApp after which you can now click get withdrawal code. The request to share to WhatsApp is also a characteristic of phishing sites. Going through the websites and following the instructions, Dubawa noted several red flags. First red flag was the link address which did not contain the organisation’s name like its official website and other WHO related sites do. Also Dubawa checked the website on duplichecker, and found the website is less than a month old as it was created on December 28, 2020. Another red flag is the grammatical errors found on the website from the congratulatory message, to the question on the business type which had unemployment as an option instead of unemployed, to the question on relationship status that gives the option divorce instead of divorced. Dubawa also reached out to the WHO for answers. The organisation released a statement on Monday January 4, 2021, distancing itself from the link. The WHO warned the public to be wary of such deception and not send money or personal information to anyone or any site claiming to be awarding funds, jobs, grants, scholarships, or other benefits on the behalf of WHO.

"Claim: A viral WhatsApp message has claimed that Covifor injection, manufactured by the Indian pharmaceutical company, Hetero, is a COVID-19 vaccine expected to be tested in Africa.","Claim: A viral WhatsApp message has claimed that Covifor injection, manufactured by the Indian pharmaceutical company, Hetero, is a COVID-19 vaccine expected to be tested in Africa.  The message attached the picture of the injectable treatment with the label “Not for Distribution in US, Canada or EU” and added a caption that states “Wake up Africa, this is not a cure but a trap to kill you as laboratory trap”.  Verdict: False. A fact-check has revealed that Covifor is not a Covid-19 vaccine. It is a treatment for the Covid-19 patients with severe symptoms of the disease and has been available in 127 countries around the world since June, 2020.  A viral WhatsApp message has claimed that Covifor injection, manufactured by the Indian pharmaceutical company, Hetero, is a COVID-19 vaccine expected to be tested in Africa. The message has been circulating on different social media platforms, majorly WhatsApp since September, 2020.  On Twitter, an account with the name GPAN (@AfricaRepublic)  posted the message with the caption “Africa must wake up” on September 2, 2020.  A reply to the tweet by Ssembogo Kwame (@SsembogoJohn3) added that “We’re dying, they want to finish us.” Another reply by a user with the name blackgirl (@blackgi56617250) said “I tell us this people they think they are very strong  but…no.”  These replies suggest that many users believed the post as true. Covifor Is Not Covid-19 Vaccine  According to the Hetero, Covifor is an injection for the treatment of Covid-19 patients with severe symptoms of the disease but not a vaccine.  The company, in a statement released on June 24, 2020, said with the Covifor, “we hope to reduce the treatment time of a patient in a hospital, thereby reducing the increasing pressure on the medical infrastructure, overburdened currently due to accelerating covid-19 infection rates.  “We are working closely with the Government and Medical Community to make ‘Covifor’ quickly accessible to both public and private healthcare settings across the country.” The pharmaceutical company added “Covifor is the first generic brand of Remdesivir which is indicated for the treatment of COVID19 patients in adults and children, hospitalised with severe symptoms of the disease”.  “The drug is available in 100 mg vial (Injectable). It needs to be administered intravenously in a hospital, critical care setting, under the supervision of a registered medical practitioner.” Covifor Is Available In Some European Countries  Contrary to the claim that Covifor is produced to be tested in African countries, the injectable treatment is sold in some European countries that include Georgia, Armenia, Belarus, etc.  According to the Gilead agreement, remdesivir (generic name for Covifor) was expected to be sold in low and middle income 127 countries around the world.  “The countries consist of nearly all low-income and lower-middle income countries, as well as several upper-middle- and high-income countries that face significant obstacles to healthcare access.  “The regulatory approval status of remdesivir varies by country, and the distribution of remdesivir within each country listed below is subject to local laws and regulations,” the agreement stated.  The agreement added that “the licenses are royalty-free until the World Health Organization declares the end of the Public Health Emergency of International Concern regarding Covid-19, or until a pharmaceutical product other than remdesivir or a vaccine is approved to treat or prevent Covid-19, whichever is earlier.”  There are many Covid-19 vaccines currently being approved by different countries around the world.  The United Kingdom has approved AstraZaneca produced by Oxford University while Biontech-Pfizer’s vaccine is currently being administered in some European countries. The claim that Covifor is a vaccine produced to be tested in Africa is false. The injectable treatment was produced by an Indian pharmaceutical company and is available in 127 countries around the world.

"Claim: A Facebook user with the name, Bas Yahemeka Bijleveld, has claimed that the linkage of National Identity Numbers (NINs) with SIM cards is a plot by the Nigerian Government to track and target social media users who use certain keywords to stimulate genocide in the country easier.","Claim: A Facebook user with the name, Bas Yahemeka Bijleveld, has claimed that the linkage of National Identity Numbers (NINs) with SIM cards is a plot by the Nigerian Government to track and target social media users who use certain keywords to stimulate genocide in the country easier.  Verdict: There is no evidence to prove the linkage of NIN with SIM cards is a plan to track social media users. According to available information, the policy as directed by the Federal Government is for security purposes and to ensure more controls over SIM ownership in Nigeria.  A Facebook user with the name Bas Yahemeka Bijleveld on Dec. 24, posted that the Nigerian government was forcing Nigerians to link their NIN with SIM cards to make tracking of social media users easier.  He added that the move would make it easy for the Federal Government to hire a company to compile a list of social media users who use some keywords to make targeted genocide easier.  “The Nigerian government is now saying they will force mobile phone providers to switch off all SIM cards that are not linked to a National Identification Number,” he wrote.  “Why you should not do this? “If you do, what becomes easy for the Nigerian government is to hire a company that shows a list of all citizens who write a certain key word on social media and in their phones and make lists per street who used those keywords, for instance everyone in the street who wrote Biafra. This is a tool that will make targeted genocide easier than ever before.”  As of December 27, the post had generated hundreds of reactions including 275 shares on Facebook.  He wrote this following the Federal government’s directive that all SIM owners in Nigeria must link their cards with their NINs or get blocked.  Thousands of Nigerians have since trooped to NIN enrollment centres around the country to obtain their identification numbers.  The Federal Government extended the deadline for incorporating NIN with SIM cards by six weeks after several complaints.  According to the Nigerian Communication Commission (NCC), the linkage of SIM cards is necessary as more controls over SIM-card ownership are needed to secure electronic transactions and curb crime as insecurity bites harder in the country.  “The revision of the policy is based on the feedback received from the security agencies following the successful revalidation of improperly registered SIM cards in September 2019 and the blocking of those that failed to revalidate their SIMs,” Dr Isa Pantami, Minister of Communications and Digital Economy said as he directed the NCC to revise the registration policy. The government added that the Boko Haram insurgency and kidnapping for ransom have been reinforced by telecom services.  There are over 207 million subscribers according to the latest NCC data for October 2020 but only 42 million Nigerians had a National Identification Number (NIN) as of September 2020. According to online data portal, Statista, Nigeria has a population of 206 million and about 100 million of them are adults. According to an analyst, Yele Okeremi, the CEO of Precise Financial Systems, the linkage of NIN with SIM cards is meant to generate a single identity for phone users in Nigeria.  He said it would help to know who is doing what with phones and to detect cybercriminals.  “The entire concept is to know who is doing what and where, so that it is not possible to go away with cyber crimes with multiple identities,” he said. According to a statement released by the NCC, Pantami and all stakeholders agreed that the measure was necessary to improve the integrity and transparency of the SIM registration process and consolidate the achievements of the SIM registration exercise of 2019. “The urgent drastic measures have now become inevitable to improve the integrity and transparency of the SIM registration process,” the statement said.  The claim that the Nigerian Government has directed linkage of NIN with SIM cards to target social media users and make genocide easy has no evidence to back it.

"Claim: An email sent to an individual claiming to emanate from Guaranty Trust Bank directed individuals to click a URL and link their registered account phone numbers with their National Identity Number (NIN) failure before December 30, 2020, of which the account will be blocked.","Claim: An email sent to an individual claiming to emanate from Guaranty Trust Bank directed individuals to click a URL and link their registered account phone numbers with their National Identity Number (NIN) failure before December 30, 2020, of which the account will be blocked. Verdict: Misleading: the email did not emanate from Gtbank and the email used in dissemination is not the official email used by GTBank. Since the Federal Government announced the use of NIN to link to phone numbers, there have been several pieces of information circulating online and offline. The government had once asked Nigerians to pay N20 to get their NIN but it later canceled the plan after receiving several knocks from Nigerians. The government also extended the deadline for NIN registration to Dec 30. While communication companies are constantly sending customers text messages to dial some codes to retrieve their NIN directly from their phone, fraudsters have decided to take advantage to defraud ignorant Nigerians. One of such moves is an email sent to Nigerians to link their phone numbers used in opening their accounts with GTB to their NIN. The message reads; Dear customer The Federal Government through the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has directed that each  bank customer’s phone number must be linked to a National Identification Number (NIN). Failure to do this by December 30, 2020 will result in your account being blocked. Don’t know your NIN? Simply follow the reference below to verify your NIN. Verify and Link your NIN here now. Thank you for choosing Guaranty Trust Bank plc Dubawa visited one of the GTbanks in Rivers State in the new GRA to verify the email sent to Nigerians. A customer care officer after viewing the email said the email does not emanate from the Gtbank.  “A closer look at the sender’s email address shows it does not bear the official email of GTbank official,” said one of the customer care officers who prefers anonymity. He said all official emails of any GTBank must end with @gtbank.com. This makes this claim fake and misleading. Further, Gmail identified the email as dangerous, used to steal data. “This message seems dangerous. Similar message was used to steal people’s information. Avoid clicking links, downloads, attachment or replying with personal information,” Gmail flagged. Another red flag detected is that a bank customer who received the email banks with United Bank of Africa (UBA) and has never had any account with GTbank. Dubawa reached out to a senior officer at the UBA in Port Harcourt, who simply identified himself as Grey, to find out if there are any collaborations with UBA and GTbank on NIN.  Grey told Dubawa that fraudsters are at work recently; therefore, the email should be discarded, adding ” and do not click any link or response to the email. We have no collaboration with GTbank. An email, asking bank customers to link their phone numbers with their NIN is misleading and did not emanate from Gtbank as claimed.

Claim: A viral WhatsApp message shows the fear some people have concerning Cervical Cancer screening becoming a cause of infertility.,"Claim: A viral WhatsApp message shows the fear some people have concerning Cervical Cancer screening becoming a cause of infertility. No! Cervical cancer screening does not cause infertility. Also, a Medical Website posted that there is a chance a woman may have a higher risk of miscarriage or infertility owing to potential changes to and scarring of the cervix after she gets the treatment. Cervical cancer is one of the most preventable malignancies among the group of human cancers. The genesis of this tumor, according to medical experts, depends essentially on an infection of the uterine cervix with Human PapillomaVirus (HPV) that needs to persist for many years and decades.  Fertility, on the other hand, is having the ability to conceive, or being able to have a child, that is, being able to become pregnant through normal sexual activity, and carrying the baby through pregnancy. While a person (man or woman) is infertile or cannot have a child, this is also referred to as infertility. A person’s fertility depends on the working properly of their reproductive organs and other factors, such as when and how often they have sex, certain hormones, and any other problems with fertility. Also, the problems with fertility, also called reproductive problems or alterations, happen when certain hormone levels are abnormally low or high, or if sex organs are removed or aren’t working properly. Although many experts believe stress and anxiety can cause changes that play a part in infertility, some people never find out why they are having fertility problems. There can be a “body system malfunction” that can change a woman’s fertility and affect her ability to get pregnant and carry a child through a pregnancy. Certain health problems, such as cancer, can also affect these things, but can Cervical Cancer screening cause inability to conceive a child? Scientists have discovered that no other cancer is as suitable for primary and secondary prevention as cervical cancer. The reason for the availability of effective protection from this malignancy by vaccination, as well as by screening is its slow and monocausal genesis. Hence, the screening is highly vital as it helps in quick identification and prompt treatment in case of any sign of cancer. Speaking on the assumption, a Consultant Gynaecologist at the University College Hospital, Ibadan, Dr Olayinka Ogunbode, said cervical cancer screening does not cause infertility and because the screening is designed to prevent cervical cancers, it can not cause further cancers. He noted that “the screening is relatively accepted here but the problem is with availability. If women are informed about the benefit of screening, they would likely accept the screening.” Dr Ogunbode explained that the problems with screening are numerous; adding that most of the prevention strategies available in Nigeria are secondary preventive measures with the commonest method being the pap smear but “we do not have enough facilities where it can be done.” He said the slides will have to be read by a Pathologist, but unfortunately, “there is scarcity of trained Pathologists for our population,”, which leads to delayed results.  The Consultant Gynecologist revealed that some centers are using less effective methods like visual inspection under acetic acid, which can be analysed by nurses and other cadre of health workers.  Highlighting some of the reasons women do not go for such screening, Dr Ogunbode said the screening in developed countries now include non-invasive methods like Human Papilloma Virus assay to identify women at high risk but these screening methods require out of pocket expenses which discourage women from partaking in it, largely because of poverty.  He noted that the equipment is also expensive to set up and will require better funding from the Government. He also added that primary preventive strategies are the current standard globally which involves the vaccination of children both boys and girls at the prepubertal age before they become exposed to Human Papilloma Virus infection. The gynecologist said the vaccines are available in a few health facilities in Nigeria but expensive and out of the reach of the poor. Many developed countries have programmes for vaccination in high school and other places for children by the age of 13, which can also be given to older men and women, but the benefit is more if given before exposure to sexual intercourse.  Answering questions on whether the screening has any side effect on women and the genitals, Dr Ogunbode said the screening does not have any major side effects on women and the genitals, though, it may cause some minor discharge and bleeding in some women, but these side effects are reduced because the screening is done under aseptic condition.  He noted that the benefits of screening are many as “it allows preinvasive forms of cervical cancers to be detected early and cervical cancers have pre-invasive lesions that may take up to 10 years to develop cervical cancers. Early detection allows them to be treated and prevents the development of cervical cancers. If we look at the huge number of deaths from cervical cancers, then the screening would have been worth it.”   Aside stress and anxiety as some causes of infertility, women can be diagnosed as infertile if any of the following problems arises: It has been explained that screening to ascertain if a woman has cervical cancer or not can not cause infertility; rather, it helps to ascertain whatever infection, virus, or disease is around the cervix that can put a woman at risk of such disease or any other. But, not getting screened can hide the truth about one’s state of health and prevent one from getting the right treatment. To encourage more cervical screening, Dr Ogunbode said more health education is needed to improve the screening of cervical cancers using community awareness methods, community leaders/influencers and faith-based organizations This should be done on the social media, radio, television and at primary health centers. The screenings need to be made free or heavily subsidized for women.  Screening services should be made available at many of the health centres across the country. There should be more surveillance like in developed countries where reminders are sent from time to time to people via electronic mails and mobile phone numbers. Finally funding for free vaccination will ultimately help to eradicate the deaths and morbidities from cervical cancers. He noted that Health insurance schemes can also allow these services to be available to women.

"CLAIM: News reports by Kakaaki News, Sahara Reporters, Punch, and some other media outlets have it that €500,000 COVID-19 fraud was traced to Nigeria by Interpol.","A news report by Kakaaki news, Sahara Reporters, Punch and some other media outlets, on Tuesday December 29, 2020, claimed that EUR 500,000 COVID-19 fraud was traced to Nigeria by the International Criminal Police Organisation known as Interpol. According to these reports, this was contained in a statement on the organisation’s website titled “Unmasked: International COVID-19 fraud exposed”. Dubawa visited Interpol’s site to find this statement and also conducted a keyword search.  The result of this search showed similar reports on this was published by the Punch on Tuesday, December 29, 2020, and Sahara Reporters on Wednesday, December 30, 2020. The search also led to a document published on April 14, 2020 on Interpol’s site titled “Unmasked: International COVID-19 fraud exposed” as claimed in the report. The document noted that this happened around March when countries were going into Lockdown and the need for face masks which was one of the control measures for COVID-19 was high. This case of fraud was described as a sophisticated fraud scheme that used compromised emails with payment for the supply of face masks. According to the document, the German health authorities contracted two sales companies in Zurich and Hamburg to procure EUR 15 million worth of face masks.  An agreement for an initial delivery of 1.5 million masks was made, in exchange for an up-front payment of EUR 1.5 million. The buyers initiated a bank transfer to Ireland and prepared for delivery, but before the delivery date, the buyers were informed that the funds had not been received and that an emergency transfer of EUR 880,000 straight to the Dutch supplier was required to secure the merchandise. The email address linked to a legitimate company in Spain selling face masks was compromised and its website cloned. This was uncovered by financial institutions and authorities across Germany, Ireland, and the Netherlands. The document showed that nearly EUR 500,000 of those funds had already been sent to the United Kingdom, all of which was destined for an account in Nigeria. Two suspects in the Netherlands were arrested as at the time the document was released in April. Subsequently, in September 2020, another report was published on Interpol which indicated that two suspects linked to the mask fraud were arrested in Nigeria. Dubawa also reached out to Kakaki News, the Punch and Sahara Reporters on Wednesday, December 30, 2020, to enquire why this case of fraud is just being reported since the information has been released by Interpol since April 2020.  As at Thursday morning, December 31, 2020, none of the news sites had responded. The claim in the reports by Kakaaki News, Punch and Sahara Reporters that  €500,000 COVID-19 fraud was traced to Nigeria is true as Interpol’s document showed this was part of the €880,000 which had been transferred from the German company to the United Kingdom destined for a Nigerian account. This is however not a recent development as Interpol had published details of this since April 2020.

Claim: Intake of fresh egg as energy and blood booster,"Belief about intake of raw eggs sometimes comes in different ways. Sometimes, it is said to be taken with malt to boost blood, and at other times, it is claimed that administering egg raw with milk to a dying human saves life. In the 1970s, a legendary movie star, Rocky Balboa, drank more than four raw eggs first thing in the morning. After this movie, several people believed that drinking raw eggs is healthy for human consumption. A fitness video on YouTube displayed eating  raw egg as a way to rebuild the body. The video was titled; Post Workout Out Meal, Raw Eggs “Rocky Style” (Eat within 13 minutes). Google defines egg as an oval or round object laid by a female bird, reptile, fish, or invertebrate, usually containing a developing embryo. The eggs of birds are enclosed in a chalky shell, while those of reptiles are in a leathery membrane . The United States of America Agriculture Department says one whole and large egg contains calories, proteins, fat, and carbohydrate. Information is lacking on the digestibility of either raw or cooked egg protein, but according to a study, cooking eggs makes it easy for  the body to be able to use almost twice as much of the protein found in raw eggs. An Australian non-profit company, Australian eggs, which provides marketing and research & development (R&D) services for the benefit of Australian egg farmers, notes that drinking or eating raw eggs offers no major advantages over eating poached or boiled eggs. Despite raw eggs containing slightly more nutrients, the nutrients in cooked eggs are in fact easier for your body to digest and absorb.  The report says while it’s generally safe to consume raw eggs as there are very few reasons to do so. Raw eggs typically contain the same benefits as cooked eggs but they don’t aid nutrient absorption quite as well, Australian eggs report said, adding that eating raw eggs also comes with a small risk of Salmonella food poisoning which is never advisable to be eaten by raw children, pregnant women elderly people and other weak immune people. The United States Department of Food and Drugs Administration estimated that 79,000 cases of foodborne illness and 30 deaths each year are caused by eating eggs contaminated with Salmonella.  The United States Minnesota Department of Health defines Salmonellosis as an infection with a bacteria called Salmonella. Salmonella lives in the intestinal tracts of animals, including birds. Salmonella are usually transmitted to humans by eating foods contaminated with animal feces. The World Health Organization says Salmonella is 1 of 4 key global causes of diarrhoeal diseases and is generally contracted through the consumption of contaminated food of animal origin (mainly eggs, meat, poultry, and milk), although other foods, including green vegetables contaminated by manure, have been implicated in its transmission. WHO says the burden of foodborne diseases is substantial in which every year almost 1 in 10 people fall ill and 33 million of healthy life years are lost. “Most cases of salmonellosis are mild; however, sometimes it can be life-threatening. The severity of the disease depends on host factors and the serotype of Salmonella. The basic food hygiene practices, such as thorough cooking are recommended as a preventive measure against salmonellosis, WHO said. Dubawa  findings reveal that any food meant to be cooked, if eaten raw, will be difficult to digest. Recently, Dubawa debunked  a WhatsApp message that claims that eating raw crayfish could aid one who does not swim to swim better. However, findings reveal that any food  meant to be cooked if eaten raw has no nutritional benefits Michelle Umeadi, a Registered Dietitian/Nutritionist and Member of British Dietetic Association, said it is unhealthy to eat or drink raw egg. Mrs. Umeadi told Dubawa that eating raw egg is toxic to people and cooking destroys germs. “There is living microorganism sometimes in egg and  if you drink it with the microorganism,  that is what can kill the person”, Umeadi added Drinking or eating raw eggs could be dangerous to humans and there is no scientific backing to the claim that intake of raw eggs rebuild energy or blood.

"CLAIM: A twitter user, Babashola Kuti (@RealSolaKuti), claimed that Heathrow Airport in the United Kingdom records more passengers than all African Airports put together.","Babashola Kuti, with over 32,000 followers on Twitter, claimed that Heathrow Airport in the UK records more passengers than all African Airports combined. “You are supposed to isolate for at least 10 days. That is why they did not test you. Heathrow has more passengers than all African airports put together. No time,” he tweeted.  He was responding to a tweet by Olujimi (@Lord_Oke) that Heathrow Airport was not screening passengers on arrival in the UK.  Heathrow Airport, originally called London Airport until 1966 and now known as London Heathrow, is a major international airport in London, which is considered as one of the busiest airports in the world.  For instance, Heathrow witnessed a record breaking day on August 4, 2019, when 262,000 passengers travelled through the terminal. Record shows that a total of 7.7 million passengers passed through the airport – nearing the capacity limit – in August, 2019, more than the 6.54 million passengers recorded in all airports in Nigeria in 2019.  But how true is the claim that the Heathrow Airport records more passenger traffic than all the airports in the 54 African countries combined?  Official data hosted on Heathrow Airport’s website show that it recorded 80.96 million passenger traffic in 2019, which is the latest full year statistics available.  In contrast, data sourced from the World Bank showed that African Airports combined (excluding Djibouti) recorded 101.01 million passenger traffic in 2019. The breakdown shows that 46 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa recorded a total of 65.68 million passengers carried through air transport while the remaining eight countries (Algeria, Djibouti, Egypt, Libya, Morocco, Somalia, Sudan and Tunisia) in Africa recorded 35.33 million passengers, bringing the total to 101.01 million.  The UN Development Programme lists 46 of Africa’s 54 countries as “sub-Saharan,” excluding Algeria, Djibouti, Egypt, Libya, Morocco, Somalia, Sudan and Tunisia. The 101.01 million passengers recorded by African airports in 2019 is far higher than the 80.96 million passengers recorded by the Heathrow Airport the same year.  Similarly, the International Air Transport Association’s (IATA) record shows that African Airports recorded 155 million travellers in 2019.  IATA represents some airlines comprising 82% of global air traffic. It is not true that the Heathrow Airport records more passenger traffic than all the airports in the 54 African countries combined. Official data from the World Bank and the International Air Transport Association (IATA) do not support the claim.

"CLAIM: Chairman of South-East Governors Forum and Governor of Ebonyi State, Dave Umahi, claims 11.5million Igbos are living in northern Nigeria and that 3 million Igbo people of voting age reside in Lagos.","CLAIM: Chairman of South-East Governors Forum and Governor of Ebonyi State, Dave Umahi, claims 11.5million Igbos are living in northern Nigeria and that 3 million Igbo people of voting age reside in Lagos.  Misleading Ebonyi State, Dave Umahi, made this statement when South-East governors visited the governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike recently. According to the Nation Newspaper that published this news update on November 10, 2020, it obtained an audio clip of Umahi saying “We have 11.5million Igbos living in the north. We have three million Igbos that are of voting age in Lagos State not to talk about other parts of this country. And somebody wants to start a war for us so that the Igbos will be slaughtered.” He made this statement in the context of the crisis early in November in Oyigbo Port Harcourt, Rivers State while denouncing Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) as a false representation of the Igbos in Nigeria.  The news article was widely circulated in fora like Nairaland garnering 1601 views as of 9 December, 2020. CrowdTangle analysis shows that it was shared on Facebook by The Nation newspaper and StraightfromNaija, a Facebook page dedicated to sharing news from the country. These two pages combined have a total number of 1,806, 013 followers. Dubawa reached out to Governor Umahi’s office to seek the source of the quoted data. He was yet to respond at press time. Further, Dubawa conducted searches on the National Population Commission(NPC) and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) portal, both harbouring demographic data on the country. Dubawa accesses the website of the National Population Commission (NPC) through the Way Back Machine. The Commission is Nigeria’s agency for collecting, analysing and disseminating demographic data in the country. It shows the last census conducted by the agency was in 2006 with a population of over 140 million at the time.  Looking further through a ten-year population projection published by the Nigerian Bureau of Statistics (NBS) covering the period of 2006-2016, the data shows a population aggregate for the 19 northern states as well as other states in the country. However, it does not delineate on ethnicity as Nigeria does not conduct census by ethnicity.  For example, Borno State in the North-east had a projected population of 4,171,104 in 2006. This is the number of people within the boundaries of the state and does not take into account any tribal designation.  That is the case for all other states within the country. In narrowing the data (2006-2016) to these northern states, which for the purpose of this fact-check includes the North-East, North-West, and North-Central states, the estimated total population at the last census(2006) is 74 million, and by a ten-year (2016) population projection, it should stand at approximately 101 million. Of this 101 million it is  too difficult to determine the number of other ethnic groups living within these states, thus rendering any projected number of Igbos in the north, as the case may be, speculative. Population projection is a “best-guess” calculation of the number of people expected to be alive within a given period. Such calculation is based on the condition that assumptions on population size, births, deaths and migration stay the same. These projections help in policymaking, planning and solutions. For example, as the world considers the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines after its approval, Nigeria would have to figure out how to get this to the most at-risk group. Population projections help in planning distribution, especially in the absence of census data.  Governor Umahi’s claim on the number of Igbos in the northern region or any Nigerian state is misleading. No current or specific data exist to support this claim.  CLAIM 2: “We have three million Igbos that are of voting age in Lagos State not to talk about other parts of this country.” – Governor Umahi The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) is Nigeria’s electoral agency responsible for voter registration and conducting federal and state elections. The agency supervised voter registration for the 2019 elections and state elections in 2020.  In the process of registration, a voter’s state of registration, which considers the place of residence or the location where the citizen will be voting, takes precedence over the state of origin which focuses on ethnicity.  According to INEC, a person qualifies to vote if they are Nigerian, of 18 years and above, and resident or work in the local government area (LGA), council or ward designated for registration by INEC. Article 10 of the Electoral Act, 2010, titled Continuous Registration, states that the requirements for a voter to register are birth or baptismal certificate, national passport identity card, or driver’s licence.  There is no requirement under INEC regulations for voters to identify their ethnic identity,  although citizen’s are permitted to travel to their local government area or state of origin to register to allow them vote in their state. For this reason, it is unlikely to determine the actual number of voting Igbo residents in Lagos.  Furthermore, a random google search on the “population of Igbos in Lagos” produces a figure that is only supported by an academic paper published in 1989 which projects the number of Igbos in Rivers, Bendel (now Edo), Lagos, and other states at 3.59million (approx. 31%) based on the 1973 census figures. However, the research article is not an authority for census data.   INEC does not register eligible Nigerians according to ethnicity and without such data, it is misleading to cite the exact number of voters of any tribe in Nigeria. The researcher produced this fact-check per the Dubawa 2020 Fellowship partnership with NewsWireNGR to facilitate the ethos of “truth” in journalism and enhance media literacy in the country. This report is errant nonsense. The NPC figures are also misleading and cannot be taking seriously. Ever since independence the Nigerian census has always been dubious. I am more likely to believe Dave Umahi estimated figures than te NPC.

"A twitter user, Reno Omokri (@renoomokri) claimed that President Muhammadu Buhari budgeted N3.2 billion for food and travel for 2020. He also claimed that President Buhari increased the fuel price three times in 2020. He further claimed that the President inherited an exchange rate of $1 to N199, the rate has risen to $1 to N500 now.","Omokri, with about 876,000 followers, made a number of claims on President Buhari’s budgets for food and travels, fuel price hike and naira-dollar exchange rates. He tweeted: “General #Buhari has a N3.2 billion food and travel budget for 2020. That is N8.7 million daily. He is living lavishly at our expense, but increased fuel price 3 times in 2020. He met dollars at $1 to N199. Now it is $1 to N500.” The 2020 budget of the Presidency obtained from the Budget Office of the Federation showed that a total of N2.65 billion was budgeted for the President’s food and travel expenses.  A look at the document showed that N2.53 billion was budgeted for his travel and transport, comprising N1.75 billion for international travel and transport and N775.60 million for local travel and transport.  In terms of the president’s food, N98.31 million was budgeted for his food stuff/catering materials supplies while refreshment and meals amounted to N25.65 million. In all, his food and travel budgets amounted to N2.65 billion, contrary to the claimed N3.2 billion. Secondly, data sourced from the Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency (PPPRA), showed that the pump price of fuel has been on a downward slide from January 2020 up to June 2020 when the agency fixed the price between N121.50 and N123.50 per litre from the N123.50 per litre it announced for May. The first price increase was in July when PPPRA raised the pump price of fuel to between N140.80 and N143.80 per litre.  The second price increase was in August, 2020 when PPPRA fixed the pump price between N148 and N150 per litre. Then, the third price increase came in September, 2020 when PPPRA fixed the price between N158.18 and N162 per litre.  Additionally, PPPRA announced the fourth increase in pump price of fuel in November, 2020 ranging between N168 to N170 per litre before announcing a N5 cut in the price in December, 2020.  Therefore, in 2020, fuel pump price was increased four times, contrary to Omakri’s claim that it was increased three times.  Finally, on the exchange rate claim, the record of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) showed that on May 28, 2015, $1 exchanged for N197. That was a day before President Buhari was sworn in to office on May 29, 2015.  However, CBN’s record showed that as at December 9, 2020, the official exchange rate was N380 per dollar.  Though parallel market exchange rates are historically higher than the official rate, official records do not support Omokri’s claims.  The claims are false. The budgets for the president’s food and travel amounted to N2.65 billion and not N3.2 billion. It is also false that the president had increased the pump price of fuel three times as at December 9, 2020 when the claim was made. Checks showed that in 2020, fuel pump price was increased four times contrary to Omakri’s claim that it was increased three times. Moreso, President Buhari inherited an exchange rate of $1 to N197 and as when the claim was made, $1 was exchanged for N380 officially.

CLAIM: INEC presiding officers made confession on electronic transmission of 2019 presidential election results.,"CLAIM: INEC presiding officers made confession on electronic transmission of 2019 presidential election results. VERDICT: TRUE! But report is from April 2019. On Sunday, November 29, 2020, news blogs reported there is a victory for 2019 presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, following revelation by some staff members of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). The news report which appeared here, here, here claimed that 13 presiding officers engaged by INEC said they transmitted results of the February 23, 2019 election electronically against the position of the commission.  It stated further that the presiding officers made the statements at the Presidential Election Petition Tribunal, sitting in Abuja. One of the reports was headlined: “Massive Victory For Atiku As INEC Staff Makes Powerful Confession That May Vindicate Him.” The post here also featured a 5:31 minutes video which analysed the report from another news platform. It reads: “About 13 Presiding Officers of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, in Borno and Yobe States, have told the Presidential Election Petition Tribunal, sitting in Abuja, that they transmitted the results of the February 23, Presidential election in their various units and wards, to the official server of INEC. “The position of the presiding officers, however, contradicted the submission of INEC, who had earlier stated in its reply to the petition, that the results were never sent to its server. “This could go a long way in vindicating Atiku if proved to be true. What do you think? Is this the end for Buhari?” Some of the comments on the report showed that the readers not only believed the report as a fresh one, they also analysed and passed comments on their thoughts on the case. One of the readers, Kampala Pender said: “They should just forget that, as the judgment will always be twisted even with millions of evidence, I advise Atiku to focus on future.” (sic) Bright Miebi commented, “please we should forget about that before there will be war in Nigeria.” HappyMan wrote: “Good news but hungry people in power will not allow it to scale through. From onset they knew who really won but was twisted.” Ologunde Evng Abraham queried “truth is always constant but who will take care of it?” While some few other comments cast aspersions on the persons of Atiku and Buhari, a reader, Prince Olaniyan Toba, asked if the information is “fresh news or old.” He, however, did not get answers from those who dropped comments. Key phrase search of the report showed that it had been published by mainstream media about 21 months ago. The report came following assertions by INEC that it did not transmit the 2019 election results electronically. Media organisations who reported this revelation include Vanguard, This Day, Premium Times, Ripples Nigeria, Daily Post. Checks on YouTube showed that the video was published by Trybez Fashion on April 26, 2019. A cursory look at the video, which has so far garnered 26,602 views showed that texts of the re-invented report were copied from the YouTube video verbatim. More so, the Presidential Election Petition Tribunal which the report referenced had completed its duties more than a year ago and has since been dissolved. Nigerian Tribune reports that the tribunal on September 11, 2019 upheld the election of President Muhammadu Buhari who was declared winner by INEC in February. Unsatisfied with the judgement of the tribunal, Atiku and the PDP approached the Supreme Court which dismissed the petition on October 30, 2019 while upholding Buhari’s election as president of Nigeria for another term of four years which will end in 2023. Even though the content of the report is true, it is coming about 21 months late. Clear evidence showed that the report was re-invented from 2019 and the elections petition tribunal has since 2019 completed its duties.

"Claim: Nigeria’s president, Muhammadu Buhari, is dead and has been replaced in the statehouse with a lookalike: here’s a picture of the lookalike, who has now grown chubby.","A Facebook page that purports to be run by the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, shared a picture with its over half a million followers on November 30. The post (archived here) shows President Muhammadu Buhari ㅡ but a chubbier version of the man. “Buhari appears to be dead and replaced by a body double because he is wracked by the ravages of dementia ~ Farooq Kperogi • November 28, 2020,” he started by quoting a newspaper columnist and Associate Professor of Journalism at Kennesaw State University. He then made an oft-repeated claim by members of IPOB: “All of you will keep dancing around the glaring truth that original Buhari rigged into Aso Rock in 2015 is dead and buried in a shallow grave in Saudi Arabia until you are all dead at the hands of Fulani terrorists he created and supported.” “Buhari is long dead. Imagine the 2020 version of your Buhari they unveiled for you gullible Nigerians last week,” he added in a possible reference to the attached picture. “Is this the Buhari of 2015 to you? No wonder Europeans colonised us with such ease.” The post had gathered over 1,300 comments and was shared over 3,300 times as of 10 a.m. on December 8. The comments showed that not only did the page’s followers believe that Buhari was dead, they also considered the picture to be authentic.  “The Buhari of 2015 was the best customer to hospitals. All of a sudden, this current Buhari is now as fresh and healthy as a newly born. Doesn’t really add up,” wrote Eze Miracle Arinzechukwu. Another follower, Tochukwu Ekpa, replied: “The gullible zoologians have long lost their sense of reasoning. Even if the real Buhari who’s in a shallow grave in Sadia Arabia is still alive today, it’s not normal for an old man to get fatter and look more young than 20 years ago. They have failed!” “Is this person also Buhari, because I don’t understand this country anymore. How many Buhari do we have?” asked Queen Isaac Emejuru. “Is like this one is Buubuu not Buhari [sic].” Also on November 30, Emeka Gift had tweeted it with the caption: “#BuhariMustGo and #SackTheServiceChiefs is trending because of #ZabarmariMassacre.” The post had over 500 retweets as of December 8. Many of the comments again showed that the picture was considered genuine by many people. Two days earlier, the picture was uploaded by Oluchi Christy alongside three other photos of Buhari. “The Buhari they are showing us on television these days is just getting fat & fatter everyday even at old age, contrary to the real Buhari in the picture 3 & 4 we have always known as slim lakpacious man from birth; till 2017 when different pictures of him began to surface on TV,” she wrote. Using the reverse image search tool, TinEye, HumAngle traced the original publication of the picture of Buhari to May 17, 2015, less than two weeks to the presidential swearing-in ceremony. One of the first websites to share the picture, alongside the official portrait of Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, was Abu Sidiqu.  Channels TV reported on the same day that the photographs were taken by Bayo Omoboriowo, “the StateCraft Inc. photographer responsible for many of the images from the recently concluded election season that culminated in Buhari’s victory.”  Omoboriowo was, soon after, appointed as Personal Photographer to the President. The original picture featured Buhari with significantly more modest body size. There are readily available applications that make it possible to make people add weight in pictures, just as there are tools to make people look more skinny. One of the former apps is Fatify, which is available both for Android and iPhone users.  “Fatify is a fun free app that lets your face swap for a fat, jiggly, animated one. It’s the best free photo booth app for Android and it makes a fat version of you with just a tap of your phone’s camera,” states the app description on Google Play Store. Similar results can be achieved by using the liquify tool available on Adobe Photoshop, an image editing software. There is also the fat maker tool on PhotoFunia, a web-based editing app, which relies on automatic face detection. Meanwhile, checks showed that the quote attributed to Kperogi truly belonged to the US-based associate journalism professor. It was, however, used in a misleading context. The quote, “Buhari appears to be dead and replaced by a body double because he is wracked by the ravages of dementia,” is from an opinion piece published on November 28. But rather than support the claim favouring Buhari’s death, Kperogi described it as a “preposterous conspiracy theory” which was too silly and infantile to deserve the attention of any serious person. He also said it was implausible. “In any case, I’d addressed this in a December 8, 2018 column titled, ‘Buhari: Not a Clone but a Clown’, where I described it as an ‘insanely absurd IPOB whispering campaign’ and as ‘so ludicrous, so off-the-wall, and so patently illogical that even acknowledging it would be an exercise in the legitimisation of stupidity’,” he wrote. “The truth is that even if they wanted to, Buhari’s inner circle is too incompetent to pull off installing a body double in Aso Rock to replace a supposedly dead Buhari.” The picture is the edited version of Buhari’s official portrait released in May 2015. The quote from Farooq Kperogi was also used in a misleading way. ",2015,09/12/2020,https://dubawa.org/buharis-portrait-manipulated-to-make-him-look-fatter-%e3%85%a1-and-it-misled-many/
Claim: Boko Haram released a video of its fighters capturing and beheading Nigerian soldiers.,"Twitter user Emeka Gift, on December 7, shared a video with his over 85,600 followers. The 32-second recording appeared to show tens of insurgents tying the arms of captured soldiers behind their backs as they lay on the ground. “Video Nigeria government don’t want the world to see. According to Nigeria government, Boko Haram has been defeat [sic]. But watch and see how Boko Haram rounded Nigeria soldiers and behead them one after the other,” Gift wrote. The video had been watched over 1,000 times as of 8p.m. on December 7. It was liked by 144 users of the microblogging platform and retweeted over 330 times. Some of the comments indicate that those engaging with the tweet believe the video to be recent. Dammy Francos, for example, wrote: “This is the Boko Haram that Zulum said Buhari is doing well.” The statement from the Borno State Governor, Babagana Zulum, was made earlier the same day, Monday, December 7. Searches through YouTube, a video-sharing platform and search engine, as well as Facebook revealed that versions of the same clip were first shared on Tuesday, December 10, 2019. On this day, a Facebook page, Biafran Update, shared the video with commentary from Simon Ekpa, a lawyer and self-described Biafra agitator.  “You can see what Boko Haram is doing. They have captured tens and tens of Nigerian soldiers to be slaughtered and killed. The video you are looking at is a new Boko Haram video of 10th November, 2019,” Ekpa said, and urged South-Easterners not to join the Nigerian military or resign if they were already part of the army. The same day, the video was shared by various YouTube channels, including Rainbow Channel and Nkoli Reporters TV. The following couple of days, it was uploaded by other channels. Two days earlier, the Islamic State of West Africa Province (ISWAP), which broke off from Boko Haram in 2016, had released a video where it killed a Nigerian soldier and police officer, who had been abducted in Benisheikh, Borno State. There is no evidence connecting the new video to a source within the terrorist camps in Nigeria. It has been suggested that the security operatives in the recording may be from neighbouring countries such as Niger Republic and that the terrorists may be fighters of the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (ISGS), which operates in Mali and Niger. “One difference seems to be, however, ISWAP is more 4×4/truck-dependent and ISGS more motorcycle-dependent; still can share tactics and personnel though,” wrote Jacob Zenn, an analyst for the Jamestown Foundation and adjunct assistant professor on African armed movements at Georgetown University’s Security Studies Programme, in December 2019. “Soldiers in the video aren’t from Nigeria,” tweeted Murtala Abdullah, a security analyst, on December 14, 2019. He  added that the appearance of the fighters did not fit into the description of those who attacked a military facility on December 10. Moreso, the timing of the video’s release coincided with the massacre of 71 Nigerien soldiers during an attack on a military camp between Niger and Mali by fighters affiliated with the Islamic State. Twelve other soldiers were wounded and many others declared missing. The country’s army spokesperson had described the incident as “the deadliest raid against the Nigerien military in living memory.” Meanwhile, two days after the video went viral, Nigerian Army Director of Public Relations, Sagir Musa, described it as propaganda from mischievous persons. “Accordingly, the call by one Simon Ekpa, (the principal actor in the clip), calling on soldiers of South-East extraction presently serving in the North-East to desert the Army and return to Biafra proved it,” he said. “Also, the call on South-Easterners not to join the Nigerian Army is an obvious indication of the essence and objective of the masterminds of this fake video which should be discountenanced by the public.” Musa did not speak further about the video’s context or why he called it fabricated. The video first appeared online in December 2019, and there is no evidence it was recorded in Nigeria and that it involved local soldiers. It has rather been debunked by the Nigerian Army and experts that suggest the victims may have been operatives of the Nigerien military.

"CLAIM: Ogun State Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Abimbola Oyeyemi, said police is the least corrupt government agency in Nigeria.","CLAIM: Ogun State Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Abimbola Oyeyemi, said police is the least corrupt government agency in Nigeria. FALSE! Police is the most corrupt agency in Nigeria. The Public Relations Officer (PRO) of the Ogun State Police Command, DSP Abimbola Oyeyemi, over the weekend stated that police in Nigeria remains the least corrupt government agency in the country. Oyeyemi who stated this at the 29th anniversary ceremony of Prestige Newspaper, a community newspaper in Ogun State on Sunday, added, however, that erring police officers in the state have been dismissed and prosecuted. Oyeyemi’s claim has since been published here, here and circulated across WhatsApp platforms.  Speaking during the event, the police spokesperson said in part: “Security should be seen as everyone’s business. The people need to give police information. Nigerians are too nonchalant to security issues, before police can perform at optimal level, there must be attitudinal change from police and citizens “I make bold to say without any form of contradiction, that the police is the least corrupt agency we have in Nigeria. How many police heads have you seen tried in this country? “I’m not saying we have a connection of angels in the force, we have bad eggs as well, but police have internal mechanisms to sanitize the system. The (#EndSARS) protest was targeted to decimate the police to carry out their devilish act.” Oyeyemi who maintained that civil servants are the most corrupt further added that, “in Nigeria today, the highest paid civil servant is a level 17 officer. But you see them building houses in choice areas. “How many police officers have houses in Ibara Housing Estate, meanwhile the whole estate is occupied by civil servants. Let me tell you, no politician can embezzle one naira without conniving with civil servants. “That was why I said where did you put civil servants when you’re saying police are the most corrupt.” According to a December 2019 study carried out by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), police ranked first as the most corrupt entity in Nigeria. Report of the second survey on corruption as experienced by the population titled: Corruption In Nigeria: Patterns And Trends stated that police officers collected more bribes at 33% above land registry officers, tax/revenue officers, prosecutors and public utility officials. “Public officials who are entrusted with some of the core functions of the state, not least those involved in law enforcement and administering justice, account for some of the largest shares of direct bribe requests: in around two thirds of all bribes paid to police, prosecutors or judges/magistrates and members of the Armed Forces, the bribe payment was initiated by a direct request by these officials,” it stated. The report also noted that the percentage of police officers who received bribes is a decrease from the 46% recorded in 2016. On why bribes are paid, the study noted that “around 3% of cases were related to payments to the police for ‘bail from jail’, a type of payment that does not refer to the legal type of bail administered by courts, but rather to payments extracted by corrupt officials for the release of arrestees from jail prior to the formal commencement of a trial.” It added that “16 percent of cases were related to payments to the police for ‘bail from jail’. These acts by police officers not only severely undermine the rule of law in Nigeria, but also negatively affect the criminal justice system by possibly providing protection to wealthy criminals. “Regardless of the specific zone of Nigeria, police officers are the type of public official with whom Nigerians have most frequent contact. Given that the risk of bribery is also highest in relation to police officers, it is not surprising that police officers account for a considerable share of all bribes paid in Nigeria: over one third (35.7 per cent) of all bribes paid in Nigeria go to police officers, while almost one fifth (19.3 percent) go to public utility officers. Taken together, around 70 per cent of all bribes are paid to just five different types of official.” Also, study conducted by Afrobarometer, a pan-African, non-partisan research network that conducts public attitude surveys on democracy, governance, economic conditions, and related issues and its Nigerian partners – CLEEN Foundation and Practical Sampling International – noted that police are perceived as the most corrupt and least trusted by Nigerians. Report of the study titled: “In Nigeria, Perceived Corruption Remains High Despite Praise For President’s Anti-Graft Fight” and published in February 2018 holds that “nine out of 10 Nigerians say at least ‘some’ public officials are corrupt, including majorities who see corruption among ‘most’ or ‘all’ officials in every public institution that the survey asked about except for the presidency. The police are seen as most corrupt; 69% of citizens say ‘most’ or ‘all’ police officials are corrupt. “Among Nigerians who sought key state services last year (2017), large proportions say they  paid bribes to receive police assistance (68%), avoid problems with the police (44%), or get government documents (38%), water or sanitation services (34%), or medical care (20%),” it added. 69% of the respondents say that “all” or “most” police officers are corrupt, while 54% claim “all” or “most” government officials are corrupt. Based on reports of studies conducted by independent organisations, the claim that police in Nigeria is the least corrupt agency is false. For a fact, police in Nigeria is the most corrupt agency in the country.

"Claim: A quote that Nigeria’s Minister of Information, Lai Mohammed, warned the United States, United Kingdom, and the European Union to stay out of the affairs of Nigeria has recently been circulating on the internet.","There has been this long-running internet quote that has Information Minister, Lai Mohammed, threatening the United States, United Kingdom, and the European Union.  The quote goes like this “We have sophisticated weapons to attack the US, UK, EU if they dare to interfere in our elections—Lai Mohammed.” The quote first came ahead of the 2019 Elections in Nigeria when Lai Mohammed’s boss, President Muhammadu Buhari was running for re-election under the All Progressives Congress (APC). Social media users shared the quote to insinuate that the minister was not pleased with the alleged interference from the United States, United Kingdom, and the European Union.  The quote resurfaced just after the #EndSARS protest that broke out in several cities across the country and the world. This time, it was edited to suit the prevailing issue. “We have sophisticated weapons to attack the US, UK, EU if they dare to interfere,” Mr Mohammed was quoted as saying in a message accompanied by his picture. Again, mobile phone users, especially on WhatsApp are using it to suggest that Lai Mohammed was not pleased with the support the protests garnered from international bodies.  Lai Mohammed was recently in the news for expressing his displeasure on how some events during the protest were reported on social media and by American news cable network, CNN.  The minister has come under heavy criticism for his stance for the regulation of social media after he blamed social media for aggravating reports related to the #EndSARS protests. “The violence that resulted from the hijack of the #EndSARS protest was catalysed by fake news and disinformation, which spread like wildfire on social media,” the minister said during a recent meeting with members of the Broadcasting Organizations of Nigeria (BON).  Also recently, The Minister while reacting to a report done by CNN on the Lekki Tollgate incident, accused the cable news platform of publishing a report that ‘falls short of journalistic standards’, and reinforces disinformation in Nigeria. “While it is up to CNN to accede or not, please note that the Federal Government reserves the right to take any action within its laws to prevent CNN from aggravating the #EndSARS crisis with unprofessional, irresponsible, one-sided, inciting, and sensational reporting that is capable of pitching Nigerians against themselves and setting the country on fire,” Lai Mohammed said.  So in line with these grievances, a graphic with a blown-up photo of Lai Mohammed and the quote has been widely shared on WhatsApp in the aftermath of the #EndSARS protests. On verification, Pulse did an internet search on this quote purportedly by Lai Mohammed and found no public and credible record of it.  The top two results of the search are the only ones that have the quote but those are from the Facebook page of a certain GossipMillBiafra. The first result was from a November 2020 post on the same Facebook page while the second was from a January 2019 post of the same Facebook page. As Nigeria’s Minister of Information, Lai Mohammed’s statements and utterances are widely covered and reported, so a quote like this would have been easy to find on the internet.  An extensive search of the quote purportedly from the minister returned nothing credible.  A viral quote which has  Nigeria’s Information Minister, Lai Mohammed, threatening the US, UK and the EU is false.

"Claim: The Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, recently claimed that Nigeria has remained at the mercy of terrorists because global partners denied attempts by the country to acquire platforms and weapons to fight the terrorists.","Claim: The Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, recently claimed that Nigeria has remained at the mercy of terrorists because global partners denied attempts by the country to acquire platforms and weapons to fight the terrorists. Misleading. There is evidence of Nigeria’s purchase of weapons and platforms from different countries. Though the United States blocked Nigeria’s weapon purchases in 2014 due to alleged human rights violations, President Trump overturned the arms embargo in 2018. It is misleading to attribute Nigeria’s inability to end terrorism and armed banditry to such denials since the country has been importing platforms, arms and ammunitions from several other countries.  Recently,  Lai Mohammed spoke on the recent slaughter of many rice farmers in Kwashebe Zabarmari axis of Jere Local government area of Borno State. The factional leader of the dreaded Boko Haram terrorists, Abubakar Shekau, confirmed that his group was responsible for the killing of the rice farmers, adding that they killed 78 farmers in the attack. A recent video posted online by ChannelsTv, the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, claimed Nigeria’s efforts to procure ammunition to defeat terrorists were “denied” and unless the weapons are acquired, Nigeria would continue to be at the mercy of terrorists.  “Nigeria has made attempts to acquire better and more effective platforms to deal with terrorists and for one reason or the other, we have been denied these platforms, these weapons and without adequate weapons, without adequate platforms, we remain at the mercy of terrorists,” the Minister said. How true is this claim? In 2014 the United States ruled out heavily arming the Nigerian military because of its alleged poor human rights record. In a speech before the US Institute of Peace in August 2015, President Muhammudu Buhari complained that the US had “aided and abetted the Boko Haram terrorists” by refusing to send arms to Nigeria forces on the grounds of “unproven allegations of human rights violations levelled.” In  the same year, the US cancelled a shipment of attack helicopters to Nigeria, even though the deal had already been signed. However, that same year, Nigeria placed an order and received six Mi-35M combat helicopters from Russia. In addition, Premium Times reported on September 17, 2014, that the Nigerian government opted for a discreet purchase of arms with cash as a measure after the American government allegedly blocked all legitimate arms orders made by the military.  In 2018, US President Trump overturned an arms embargo imposed by his predecessor, Barack Obama. Trump agreed in 2018 to sell arms and fighter jets to Nigeria to fight Boko Haram. Same year, Nigeria paid the United States government $496 million for the acquisition of 12 Super Tucano fighter jets to be used by the Nigerian Air Force. Nigerian Air Force disclosed that from 2015 to date, Nigeria has acquired 23 brand new aircrafts, including the latest Mi-171E Helicopter acquired from Serbia by the federal government.  The Serbian Ilyushin 76 Strategic Airlifter aircraft that brought the latest helicopter touched down at the NAF Base, Makurdi on December 3, 2020. A statement released by the Director of Public Relations and Information of the Nigerian Air Force (@NigAirForce), Air Commodore Ibikunle  Daramola, revealed that, “The new aircraft is the second of two Mi-171E helicopters procured by the current Federal Government and brings to 23 the total number of brand new aircraft acquired since 2015.” NAF tweeted the photos of the latest helicopter on its official handle, @NigAirForce Recently, the Chief of Air Staff, Sadique Abubakar, told the Senate Committee on Air Force that Nigeria has procured aircrafts from different countries.  “We are expecting 3 J-17 fighters from Pakistan, 12 super Tucano from the United States, one M-171… Out of the 12 A – 29 Super Tucanos from the US, six are almost here as those to handle them have been sent on training for that purpose,” he said. On November 30, 2020, NAF tweeted that the A-29 Super Tucano Aircraft Project between Nigeria and the United States of America is still on course for delivery as scheduled as President Muhammadu Buhari ordered in April 2018. Meanwhile, in April this year, the Nigerian Army (NA) took delivery of high grade armoured tanks and artillery trucks purchased by the Federal Government. Taking delivery of the armaments then, Army’s Chief of Policy and Plans, Lieutenant General Lamidi Adeosun said Nigerians should expect more robust operations to overtake the menace of insecurity including Boko Haram, banditry and others. “From this, you can see how serious the Federal Government of Nigeria is in making sure that the Nigerian Army is not only equipped, but contains the problem of insecurity we are having across the country,” Lieutenant General Adeosun said. Significantly, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed that Nigeria spent N115.88 billion on import of arms and ammunition in five years. A breakdown of the imports by years showed that Nigeria spent N786 million in 2015, N142 million in 2016, N233.35 million in 2017, N1.95 billion in 2018 and N12.77 billion in 2019 on imports of arms and ammunition.  Interestingly, NBS data showed that in the first half of 2020, Nigeria has spent about three times the amount of money spent in five years in importing arms and ammunition.  The first and second quarters, 2020 Foreign Trade Statistics released by the NBS showed that from January to June, 2020, Nigeria spent N54.8 billion on arms and ammunition importation.   However, the data were not disaggregated on the basis of private and government purchases, but it gives a clue to rising importation of arms and ammunition into the country. Being that these arms purchases were recorded by a government agency, it is most likely the government’s property or that of few individuals with licenses to import arms could have been included in the tally given by NBS. Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) Trend Indicator Values (TIVs) estimated that between 2015 and 2019, Nigeria has spent about $356 million on arms imports.  The SIPRI values cover the supply of military weapons through sales, aid, gifts, and those made through manufacturing licenses. Data cover major conventional weapons such as aircraft, armored vehicles, artillery, radar systems, missiles, and ships designed for military use. Excluded are transfers of other military equipment such as small arms and light weapons, trucks, small artillery, ammunition, support equipment, technology transfers, and other services. In April this year, President Muhammadu Buhari dispelled the commonly held assumptions that the terrorists in the Northeast had far more weapons and money than the government, stressing that what was left of them were “mere scavengers desperate for food, raiding shops and markets, and killing innocent persons in the process.” A statement released by Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu on August 11, 2020, quoted the President as saying, “The services have resources; yes, they need more, and mobility, and are doing their best, but there is a need for better gathering and interpretation of intelligence.” Shehu disclosed that the President informed the Governors of the imminent shipment of military weapons and aircraft from Jordan, China, and the United States and that this could be the reason Nigeria spent N54.8 billion on weapon imports in the first half of 2020, more than the amount spent in five years recorded by the NBS.  Although efforts of Nigeria to import platforms and weapons from some countries may have been denied,  there is evidence of Nigeria’s weapons and platform purchases from different major arms producing countries. Though the United States blocked Nigeria’s weapon purchases in 2014 due to alleged human rights violations, President Trump overturned the arms embargo in 2018. It is misleading to attribute Nigeria’s inability to end terrorism and armed banditry to such denials as the country has been importing platforms, arms and ammunitions from several other countries.

CLAIM: That the APC-led government is securing the country.,"Yahaya Bello, Governor of Kogi State, on November 19th, 2020, claimed that the All Progressive Congress (APC) led government is securing Nigeria, stating that this among other sterling achievements of the ruling party would stir them to victory in the next general election in 2023. He made this known when he appeared as a guest on Thursday’s edition of Channels Television’s Politics Today. The ICIR conducted a review of the recent weekly update of data of Nigeria security situation by Nigeria Security Tracker (NST) of 4 consecutive weeks, October 20 to November 20, 2020. Analysing the 4 reports ( week 1, 2, 3, and 4), 620 people were killed in 34 states of the federation, including the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), as a result of various forms of violence across the country. The reports gathered that a total of 293 were civilians, 64 security operatives, two were political actors and 20-year-old Pelumi Onifade, a journalist, was killed in custody by men of the Nigerian police. Other casualties included 128 Boko Haram members, 124 armed persons, eight robbers, two sectarian actors (2), and a kidnapper. The highest death tolls were recorded in Borno (163), Katsina (72), Lagos (68), and Kaduna (64). They were followed by Zamfara (34), Edo (26), Cross River (18), Delta (15), Plateau (14), Yobe (12). NST advanced that the bulk of deaths recorded in Lagos were as a result of the extrajudicial killings of peaceful protesters by men of the Nigerian Army and sponsored thugs during the height of the protest against police brutality in the state.  In October, Nigerian youths across the country staged a renewed national protest against police brutality, especially the notoriety of the special anti-robbery squad, one of the tactical units of the Nigerian police force. The protest signalled the zero confidence Nigerians have in the country’s police force which is known for extortion, extra-judicial killings, and gross violation of human rights. The peaceful protest, however, turned bloody when Nigerian security forces, including soldiers, opened fire on hundreds of protesters in Lagos. On kidnapping, the data revealed that in the same months under review,  a total of 224 people were kidnapped across 18 states. The acts took place in Katsina (38), Nasarawa (30), Kaduna (27), Zamfara (23), and Edo (23). Following closely were Ondo with 29 cases, Niger (14), Borno (9), Benue (5), Cross River (5), and Delta (5).  In addition, the northwestern part of the country is currently a hotbed for banditry and kidnapping activities.  Data from Assessment Capacities Project (ACAPS) also revealed that about 21 million people living in these states have been exposed to insecurity from activities of bandits. Banditry violence began as a farmer/herder conflict in 2011 and intensified between 2017 to 2018 to include cattle rustling, kidnapping for ransom, sexual violence and killings. The violence has affected about 35 out of 92 local government areas in the 4 states. The discovery of gold mines and the activities of illegal miners competing for the control of gold reserves have served to further intensify the existence and activities of armed groups in the northwest. By March 2020, more than 210,000 people have been internally displaced. More than 35,000 refugees have crossed communal borders to Maradi in the Niger Republic by the beginning of March 2020. Similarly, Nigeria retained its seat as the third country with the worst impact of terrorism for six consecutive times globally, the 2020 Global Terrorism Index (GTI) report stated. Even though terror-related deaths declined to 1,245 in 2019, Boko Haram recorded an increase in their activities targeted at civilians.   Terror-related deaths and incidents attributed to Boko Haram in Nigeria increased by 25 and 30 percent respectively from the prior year. Over the past year, Boko Haram increased attacks on military targets, with deaths rising from 26 in 2018 to 148 in 2019. An attack on Rann, Borno, on January 28, 2019, by Boko Haram terrorists which left at least 60 people flowing in the pool of their blood while dozens were reported missing in the attack made one of the worst attacks in 2019. The group was also responsible for Nigeria’s deadliest terrorist attack in 2019 when assailants attacked a funeral in Badu, Borno State. At least 70 people were killed and 10 others were wounded in the attack and ensuing clash. According to the report, Fulani extremists were responsible for 26 percent of terror-related deaths in Nigeria at 325 fatalities. The majority of terrorist activity related to Fulani extremists occurred in the states of Kaduna, Plateau and Benue. Of the 111 attacks attributed to Fulani extremists, over 59 were armed assaults. In its latest tragic strike, Boko Haram at least beheaded 110 farmers who were working on their rice fields in Zabarmari, Maiduguri. It was gathered that the farmers were tied up and had their throats slit by the Assailants, making murder the most “insane” attacks on civilians this year. This came a month after Boko Haram militants slaughtered 22 farmers working on their irrigation fields near Maiduguri, in two separate attacks.

Claim: A Twitter post claims Moderna vaccine has 100% effectiveness against severe coronavirus infection.,"A Twitter post by @spectatorindex shared on Monday November 30, 2020, claims moderna’s coronavirus vaccine is 100% effective against severe coronavirus infection.  This post has so far generated 8,305 retweets and 4,012 quote tweets and 35.8 thousand likes. “BREAKING: Moderna’s coronavirus vaccine shows an efficacy of 100% against severe coronavirus infections” Dubawa conducted a keyword search on the Moderna Vaccine and coronavirus. Moderna vaccine identified as mRNA-1273 is a vaccine in response to the threat of coronavirus by a biotechnology company named Moderna founded in 2010.  This company focuses on mRNA science and is pioneering a new class of medicines made of messenger RNA, or mRNA. The potential implications of using mRNA as a drug are significant and far-reaching and could meaningfully improve how medicines are discovered, developed and manufactured.  Dubawa also studied the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) draft landscape for candidate vaccines. The document showed that the Moderna/NIAID vaccine is among the 48 WHO’s candidate vaccines in clinical evaluation. A report by Associated Press (AP) noted that Moderna Inc. made it known on Monday that it would be asking the United State (U.S.) and European regulators to allow emergency use of its COVID-19 vaccine. This it said is because results of a new study  confirm the shots offer strong protection. A similar report by the New York Times noted that Moderna is seeking this emergency approval to ensure first shots of its vaccine are given as early as December 21 as the number of COVID-19 cases continues to rise. In another report, the British Broadcasting Corporation(BBC) noted that Moderna is filing for US and European emergency regulatory approval of its coronavirus vaccine so it can be recommended for widespread use. Clinical studies show it is more than 94% effective at protecting people from becoming ill with Covid-19. Moderna application is the second application, coming two weeks after Pfizer and BioNTech.’ A report by The Guardian noted final results confirm the Moderna vaccine has 94% efficacy.  Another report by BBC noted the vaccine shows near 95% effectiveness. A similar report by Science Magazine noted that no one who got the Moderna vaccine in trial developed severe COVID-19. In a look at the Moderna website Dubawa studied an Infographic that contained a timeline summary of the different stages of the vaccine. This timeline showed that as of November 16, the vaccine shows the vaccine so far has 94.5% efficacy.  Moderna also in a publication on its site on November 30, 2020 noted that its vaccine is 94.1% effective against COVID-19 and 100% effective against severe COVID-19.  While the spread of COVID-19 continues to rise, the severity has been seen to vary from mild to moderate, and then to severe. A London-based GP and GP trainer, Dr Mary Lowth, believes the public would benefit from knowing the difference between these severity levels.  Doctors have used different terms to describe COVID-19 severity. Terms like; Asymptomatic, Mild, Moderate, Severe, and Critical have been used.  Most people who are young and healthy are likely to be in group 2 (mild) or 3 (moderate). Being asymptomatic simply means that a COVID-19 patient does not have symptoms of the virus. Mild cases are seen in most healthy people under 60 who have symptoms. The symptoms typically last about 7 to 10 days. As many as 80% of symptomatic cases are mild and remain mild in severity. However, it is noteworthy that people with mild illness can take a turn for the worse, especially those in vulnerable groups. The main symptoms of mild COVID-19 include: Temperature (in 90% of cases), a dry cough (70%), tiredness (40%), feeling slightly breathless (20%), muscle pain (15%), headache (15%), sore throat (14%), and diarrhoea (4%). When the illness gets worse, it becomes a moderate case which is said to be common and may last for around 7 to 14 days. People with moderate illness are more breathless and tend to have an increased heart rate, when moving around.   In addition to the symptoms you may get with a mild COVID-19, moderate COVID-19 patients may also experience a temperature higher than 37.8C, feeling breathless when doing moderate exercise (such as walking up stairs), soreness from coughing, but no pain, a more persistent cough, several times an hour, a headache, particularly if you’re hot with tiredness,  a need to stay in bed and with a dry mouth. People with a severe form of the illness may develop pneumonia, Severe cases are more likely seen in older people or people with any health conditions that make them vulnerable.  Severe cases are not impossible in those who are healthy, but they are less common. Symptoms of severe COVID-19 infection and the resulting pneumonia include: extreme breathlessness – you can’t do much or speak easily, pain in your chest, tummy or back when you breathe, a high temperature, a tight chest, lacking the desire to eat or drink, seeming confused to others, bluish lips or face. Other common symptoms of pneumonia caused by the illness include: rapid and shallow breathing, fast heartbeat, unwell appearance, and lowered blood pressure. The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defined Severe illness from COVID-19 as hospitalization, admission to the ICU, intubation, mechanical ventilation, or death. It also noted that adults of any age with underlying illnesses, like cancer, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), health conditions( heart failure, coronary artery disease, or cardiomyopathy), weakened immune system from solid organ transplant, obesity, pregnancy, sickle cell disease, smoking, asthma type 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus, cystic fibrosis, hypertension, liver disease, etc., may be affected. Medscape also defined severe COVID-19 any case of COVID-19  associated with dyspnea, hypoxia, or greater than 50% lung involvement in imaging. It may also be associated with respiratory failure, shock, or multiorgan system dysfunction. Medscape noted that severe or acute COVID-19 can be managed by providing supportive care of complications, including advanced organ support for respiratory failure, septic shock, and multiorgan failure.  It also said that empiric testing and treatment for other viral or bacterial etiologies may be warranted and patients with severe or critical COVID-19 are likely to require aerosol-generating procedures, so they should be placed in an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR), if available. The patients here are very unwell and develop severe pneumonia. A condition called severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) can develop (i.e when the small air sacs in the lungs become so inflamed and wet that they stick shut and the surfactant can’t hold the tiny air sacs open). If this happens, you’ll need a ventilator to help inflate your lungs. In the worst cases, people can develop sepsis, which causes other organs to stop working. It’s possible to survive critical COVID-19 if you have intensive care help, but even that is not always enough. The claim that Moderna is 100% effective against severe COVID-19 is true from the data released by Moderna company and other media reports. While the vaccine is 94.5% effective against COVID-19, it is 100% effective against severe COVID-19 as it was reported that no one given the moderna vaccine during trial developed severe COVID-19.   However, it is worthy of note that while Moderna is seeking approval to roll out its vaccine following the result of effectiveness, regulators will look at trial data for the mRNA vaccine and decide if it is safe and effective enough to recommend for roll out.

Claim: Nigeria’s Information Minister Lai Mohammed denied that he once announced a N5 million fine on hate speech in Nigeria.,"By Steve Dede Claim: Nigeria’s Information Minister Lai Mohammed denied that he once announced a N5 million fine on hate speech in Nigeria.  Contrary to Lai Mohammed’s denial, he did announce the increment of fine on hate speech from N500, 000 to N5 million as evident in the available video clip. After the report that the Federal Government imposed a N5m fine on hate speech on broadcast stations in Nigeria, Lagos based radio station Nigeria Info 99.3FM was one of the first broadcast stations to be hit with the fine.  This development prompted a human rights lawyer, Inibehe Efiong, to challenge the imposition of the fine in court. Mr Effiong also challenged the threat by the National Broadcasting Commission to punish other broadcast stations in the country over alleged hate speech. In a counter-affidavit in response to a motion filed by the human right lawyer, Lai Mohammed denied ever announcing the increment of the fine from N500, 000 to N5, 000,000.  “Paragraph 19 is denied. The 2nd defendant (Mohammed) did not announce an increment in any fine for hate speech from N500,000 to N5,000,000 or any other because there is a governmental body or institution mandated to regulate and enforce the Nigerian Broadcasting Code,” Punch quoted from the affidavit. Contrary to his denial, Mr Mohammed did announce the increment of the fine. On Tuesday, August 4, 2020, Nigeria’s Minister of Information Lai Mohammed announced that the Federal Government had increased the fine for hate speech from N500, 000 to N5m.  Although there have been earlier reports that the Federal Government was planning to increase the fine from N500, 000 to N5 million, Mr Mohammed on that day confirmed the speculation. During the unveiling of the Reviewed Broadcasting code, the Minister said a presidential directive necessitated the amendments in the wake of the 2019 general elections.  While announcing the amendment of the Broadcasting Code, the minister said; “Another highlight of the amendment is the provision that has raised the fine for hate speeches from half a million Naira to N5m. This will serve as a deterrent to those who want to use our broadcast stations to sow the seed of discord.”  A detailed search on this finds Lai Mohammed’s announcement of the increase in the fine for hate speech between 10:48- 11:22 minute mark of a video on Channels TV Youtube page.  A search on the subject on Google also brings several results from credible and popular media platforms like Premium Times, Punch, Naira Metrics and Pulse who reported Lai Mohammed’s announcement.  Lai Mohammed did announce the Federal Government’s increment of the hate speech fine from N500, 000 to N5 million.

"Claim: a certain website claims the Federal Government of Nigeria is recruiting and employing 50,000 youths via a link it provided.","A certain websites: http://bit.ly/3IE2yCG bearing the emblem of the National Directorate of Employment claims that the federal government of Nigeria is offering employment and recruiting 50,000 youths via a link the website provided. The information which is shared as a web-based message on WhatsApp has been shared across the platform over 1,750.  The link requires the user to complete a 4-stage procedure before accessing the said job.  The first step requires one provide name and year of graduation; the second is the provision of contact details such as email, city, and contact number; and third requires the user to upload a passport and share a certain link on WhatsApp as provided by the website before accessing the said job which is the fourth stage.  In the past, Dubawa has analyzed websites offering jobs to be both dubious and while misleading unsuspecting members of society. It is due to this existing skepticism that Dubawa again opts to verify the authenticity of this website and the pact it seeks to offer. Dubawa carefully followed through the stages offered by the website as a requirement for employment. The third stage which requires users to share a certain link to multiple users on WhatsApp before accessing the said job proved inexhaustible as there was nothing on the last stage.  Also, when the link the website offered was analyzed on Scamdoc, the tool gave it a very bad trust score of 1%  and suggested that the link was recent and known for being used by fraudulent websites.  Also, we uncovered the link in question to be a data phishing website. These sites are usually riddled with installed root pop-up ads that generate traffic through fraudulent schemes; worse still, they engage in the extraction of users’ data and financial details for nefarious purposes.  Furthermore, Dubawa uncovered that The National Directorate of Employment has disclosed a news release on its official websites in February 2020 to train 50,000 individuals on ‘Skills for Job’ not recruiting or employing youths as claimed by the website under scrutiny.  Dubawa reached out to the National Directorate of Employment but was yet to receive feedback over the claim. The facts uncovered proved that the link and the information the website propagates is false. Furthermore, the Federal Government has never carried employment through third party websites or asked individuals to share or forward a link as a necessary requirement.

"Claim: Farooq Kperogi, an associate professor of journalism, claimed in a tweet that “Nigeria is d 2nd most terrorized country on earth.” He also alleged that Nigeria is “d global capital of poverty”.","On Tuesday, November 24, Farooq Kperogi, an associate professor of journalism and emerging media in the United States, posted a tweet with two major verifiable claims. Firstly, he claimed that Nigeria is the second most terrorised country in the world.  Secondly, the university don alleged that Nigeria is also the global capital of poverty. Kperogi was reacting to a statement by the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, that a report by CNN regarding the alleged killing of unarmed #EndSARS protesters could set Nigeria on fire. “Lai Moh’d said CNN’s news report on d Lekki Massacre could set Nigeria “on fire.” But Nigeria is already on fire. You can’t set fire on fire. Nigeria is d 2nd most terrorized country on earth, d global capital of poverty, d haven of homicidal kidnappers, and a snake pit of cruelty. As at Sunday, November 29, the tweet has been shared about 1,700 times with almost 4,000 likes. The Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP) publishes annually the Global Terrorism Index (GTI) which “provides the most comprehensive resource on global terrorism trends.” The index is based on statistics collected in the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) and other sources. At the time Kperogi posted his tweet on Tuesday, November 24, the IEP had not published the GTI report for 2020. Thus, Legit.ng first verified the claim using the GTI report for 2019.  According to the 2019 report, Nigeria was ranked the third most terrorised country among a total of 163 countries, trailing Afghanistan and Iraq. By Wednesday, November 25, the IEP released its latest GTI report for 2020. Nigeria still retains the number three spot in the new report, also trailing Afghanistan and Iraq. Though Nigeria retains the third spot, the GTI 2020 report indicates that “total deaths from terrorism in Nigeria fell to 1,245 in 2019, a 39 per cent decline, making it the lowest in the country since 2011.” Based on the two cited reports, the claim that Nigeria is the second most terrorised country on earth is false. World Poverty Clock, developed by World Data Lab, “provides real-time poverty estimates through 2030 for nearly every country in the world”. The project is funded by the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and the Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development of Germany. In 2018, a report by Brookings Institution, citing data from the World Poverty Clock, indicated that Nigeria had overtaken “India as the country with the largest number of extreme poor.” At the time, Nigeria had about 87 million people in extreme poverty, compared with India’s 73 million, the report stated. In 2019, data from the World Poverty Clock indicated that the number of Nigeria’s poor, that is, those living on less than $1.90 a day, had increased to 91 million as reported here and here. However, Legit.ng on Sunday, November 29, discovers that the latest data from the World Poverty Clock indicates Nigeria now has about 88 million people (87,936,439) living in extreme poverty, a clear drop from the 2019 figure.  The latest figure represents 43% of Nigeria’s population which the report puts at 204,726,256. According to the data, Nigeria’s current escape rate from poverty is -5.8 people per minute. This implies that every minute, 5.8 Nigerians slide into poverty. On the other side, the World Poverty Clock’s latest data on India puts the country’s current poverty figure at 130,341,506, far above Nigeria’s figure. Further checks also indicate that World Poverty Clock’s data from 2018 have changed from the one cited by Brookings Institution in the same year. World Data Lab, the owner of World Poverty Clock, is yet to respond to Legit.ng‘s email seeking clarification regarding the change in data. However, the organisation stated on its website that the World Poverty Clock’s dataset was updated in November 2020, “taking into consideration the COVID-19 pandemic effects in the economy.” Meanwhile, a fact-check by Africa Check published in October 2020, also noted that the most recent data on poverty by the World Bank puts India far ahead of Nigeria, “with 268.7 million people in poverty, compared to Nigeria’s second place of 84.7 million.” When Legit.ng checked the World Bank’s data on Sunday, November 29, the figures for both Nigeria and India have slightly changed. While India’s figure increased to 284.6 million, Nigeria’s figure reduced to 78.5 million. Also, the 2019 report on Nigeria’s poverty by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) states that Nigeria has 82.9 million poor people, representing 40.1 percent of the country’s total population. The report classified poor Nigerians as those whose real per capita expenditures are below N137,430 per year. It, however, excludes Borno due to the difficulty in collecting data in the state which is under recurring Boko Haram attacks. Based on the above, there is no evidence to support the claim that Nigeria is currently the global capital of poverty. The most recent available data show India still has more people living in extreme poverty than Nigeria.

"Claim: A WhatsApp message has claimed that eating crayfish fresh can make an individual, who does not know how, swim better in the river.","Recently, a  message posted on Whatsapp claimed that eating crayfish raw without cooking can teach an individual new to swimming how to swim while in the river. “Do you know that eating fresh Crayfish without cooking it will teach you how to swim in the river”, the post claims, adding that crayfish can swim better in the river which makes anyone who eats it fresh will swim like crayfish. Dubawa through a Google search unraveled several publications on the best ways to swim for beginners. A sport publication, Swim-in-the-river on December 28, 2019 published an article titled; top 5 Fundamentals of fast swimming… The publication said fast swimming depends on constant practice with a coach that guides smartly and not hardly. The publication further advises learners  to improve their balance to stay energetic in water while swimming with efficient kicks. Swim in the river on January 4,2020  published 7 swim to learn methods for beginners which include the moving of arms, the constant crawling in the water with the backstroke  A YouTube video with over a million views also teaches beginners how to swim with which the coach started teaching her student by saying, “Breathe in, go under, and out, once you have started holding your breath on the water to start floating with you back. A Youtube video titled; Learn to swim Float for beginners (easy tutorial) stated that the first step for beginners is to know their balance and breathe control. All the videos and articles written in the past never suggest that eating fresh crayfish while in the river is an easy way to learn swimming rather they all say the same thing such as; know your balance and control your breath as a beginner who wants to learn how to swim. Dubawa  reached out to Michelle Umeadi, a Registered Dietitian/Nutritionist and Member of British Dietetic Association for comments on the benefit of eating crayfish fresh. Mrs. Umeadi who is also a Co-founder of  Citadel Nutrition Consult told Dubawa that things that are eaten raw will over work the kidney and the liver  in terms of detoxification. Umeadi said anything that is supposed to be cooked is supposed to reduce digestion, make the food  Bioavailable which means the body is able to process it, to take what is needed. “But taking it raw you are overworking your organ trying to process or digest what you have eaten and it won’t be useful to you, so what it is the need of eating it raw”, she said. Crayfish also called crawfish are among the aquatic groups that most of the time live in the river– either freshwater or saltwater–while some live in the burrows. However, all crayfish can borrow, according to a publication by Bethany Grant Crayfish have a hard exoskeleton made from calcium, and its exoskeleton protects the internal tissues from injury. The exoskeleton of crayfish can be a variety of different colors ranging from white to pink, orange, brown, to greenish-blue or dark blue and are characterized by a joined head and thorax region and a segmented abdomen possessing moveable parts, Bethany Grant said. The claim that eating crayfish fresh while alive in the river will help beginners swim better is False and Misleading. Experts have said eating crayfish fresh without cooking will endanger your health. ",health,01/12/2020,https://dubawa.org/eating-raw-crayfish-is-harmful-to-health-and-will-not-make-you-swim-better/
Claim: Nigeria is ranked the number one country according to the population of people killed because they are Christians.,"In a tweet shared on Friday, November 20, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, claimed that Nigeria is ranked the worst country in the world in terms of the number of Christians killed because of their religion. “Nigeria ranks No. 1 in the world in the number of Christians killed for their faith. The Buhari regime has failed to protect innocent Christians. Will @StateIRF take action and live up to its mission of promoting religious freedom around the world?” he wrote. State IRF refers to the Office of International Religious Freedom, a unit under the United States government. Kanu’s tweet included a link to an opinion article published by The Jerusalem Post in October. It had over 4,500 likes and had been shared over 5,500 times as of 9 pm on Thursday, November 26. To start with, the article published by The Jerusalem Post and titled Christians Targeted in Nigeria: Why the World Should Care does not mention any ranking on the targeted killing of Christians in Nigeria. If what’s happening with Boko Haram isn’t bad enough, increasingly the Nigerian government’s nonchalant approach to dealing with the terrorists have [sic] inspired young people like Michael to embrace their tactics and extremism.  As a result thousands-upon-thousands of Christians in Nigeria have had their lives and property destroyed by militant Fulani tribesmen in the central part of the country on a new “jihad.” The article neither specifies how many have been killed nor concludes that a large number of Nigerians of the Christian faith who were killed were victims because of their faith. In fact, it says: While the perpetrators of violence in the Middle Belt are almost exclusively Fulani, the vast majority of Fulani are not perpetrators. Indeed, many Fulani Muslims have spoken out against them. And other Fulani have also been killed by Islamist terrorists throughout the country. While HumAngle has found no publicly available ranking of countries according to the “number of Christians killed for their faith,” what appears closest to this is a study released by Open Doors USA. Open Doors is non-profit that describes itself as a “community of Christians who come together to support persecuted believers in more than 60 countries.” The 2020 World Watch List (WWL) released by the group ranks “the top 50 countries where Christians are persecuted for their faith,” using “data from field workers and external experts.” According to the list, Nigeria is the 12th most dangerous country in the world for a person to be a Christian. This is after North Korea, Afghanistan, Somalia, Libya, Pakistan, Eritrea, Sudan, Yemen, Iran, India, and Syria. The country’s profile on page 22 does not provide any specifics about the number of deaths. It only says, “Christians in the northern region and in the Middle Belt suffer from violence perpetrated by Islamic extremist groups such as Hausa/Fulani militant herdsmen and Boko Haram.”  “Such violence often results in loss of life, physical injury, as well as loss of property. As a result of the violence, Christians are also being dispossessed of their land and means of livelihood—and Christians with a Muslim background also face rejection from their own families,” it concludes. The persecution of Christians in the report is divided into two parts: Violence and Pressure. Though violence against Christians was placed highly at 99.9 percent for Nigeria, Pakistan, which is ranked the fifth-worst country, is given the same evaluation under that category. In a report published in August, HumAngle established that often-quoted figures on anti-Christian genocide in Nigeria were grossly inaccurate and unreliable. Dr Kabir Adamu, a security consultant and Managing Director of Beacon Consulting, had told this paper that no organisation had been able to gather sufficient data to analyse victims of insecurity on the basis of faith. “It would not be scientific to come to that kind of conclusion. To come to that kind of conclusion, it means you have identified, documented all the victims and, through your analysis, you are able to know their religion, and I doubt anyone has been able to do that,” he said. HumAngle reached out to Kanu for the source of his claim shared on Twitter but was yet to receive a response at the time of writing. There is no evidence available to support the claim. A widely cited 2020 report by a US-based non-profit on the persecution of Christians, however, ranks Nigeria the 12th worst country in the world for Christians to live.

CLAIM: A viral meme claims a British study shows passing gas may help one live longer.,"A meme making the rounds on social media claims a new British study shows passing gas may help you live longer and smelling gas may prevent dementia.  According to the meme, researchers found that passing wind helps lower the risk of cancer, heart attack, and stroke. The meme noted that the main ingredient in gas passed, which is hydrogen sulfate,  causes the brain to grow stronger and protect the brain from danger when inhaled. Dubawa conducted a keyword search on passing gas and its benefits. This led to different reports and studies on passing gas which is referred to as flatulence. A report by World Health Net posited that smelling passed gas can make someone live longer. The report made this claim, quoting two authors from the 2015 study. In 2019, another report quoting a study with no title or year claims hydrogen sulfide has health benefits when administered in low doses. How to measure this “low dose” was, however, not stated. Flatulence is a medical term for releasing gas from the digestive system through the anus. It occurs when gas collects inside the digestive system and is a normal process. It is commonly called “passing wind” or “farting”.  Gas collects in two main ways. One is when you swallow air while you eat or drink which can cause oxygen and nitrogen to collect in the digestive tract and two, gases such as hydrogen, methane, and carbon dioxide accumulate in the digestive system as you digest food.  Flatulence has its benefits like reducing stomach pain, a sign of a healthy digestive system, tells if your diet is healthy or not, improves colon health, reduces bloating, etc. Hydrogen sulphide (H2S) is a colorless gas that smells like rotten eggs. It is the gas that’s released when humans pass gas. Hydrogen sulphide which is said to occur naturally in some environments (gas wells, sulfur springs, swamps, etc.), can be flammable at very high levels. Significant hydrogen sulfide poisoning usually occurs by inhalation. It can also be associated with animal farms, industrial plants, sewers or sewage treatment plants. Although Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is commonly known as a toxic gas with an unpleasant odor,  in the human body it plays a role as a gaseous transmitter involved in the control of physiological processes. Studies have shown that H2S increased synaptic long-term potentiation in the central nervous system and exerted the inflammatory and anti-inflammatory effects in vascular endothelium. It is, however, worthy of note that this effect depends on the concentration of the gaseous molecule. Researchers believe that H2S may play a potential role in the physiology of the gastrointestinal tract including the mechanism of gastroprotection of gastric mucosa and possibly exerts a protective effect in other parts of the digestive system. However, the physiological and toxic levels of H2S in the human body remain unclear and most of the mechanisms of action underlying the effects of H2S have yet to be fully clarified. Researchers believe this is the reason its benefit has been neglected. H2S have been confirmed to exist and have advantages in mammalian tissues. At a pH of 7.4 in the mammalian body, one-fifth of the total H2S subsists in an undissociated form, with the remaining content existing as hydrosulfide anions (HS−) and sulfide (S2−). Various studies performed on rat, human, and bovine brain tissues have determined that H2S is present at levels of up to 50–160 μmol/L in tissues and that sodium hydrogen sulfide (NaHS) is one of the physiological donors of H2S. H2S is principally produced in the liver, kidney, enterocytes, and vascular smooth muscle cells via cystathionase and partially produced in cardiac tissue by Mercaptopyruvate Sulfurtransferase (MST).  A report by Helathline made reference to a 2014 study conducted by a collaborative research team at the University of Exeter in the United Kingdom and University of Texas. This study posited the idea that smelling sulfide could be good. The study believes mitochondria, the part of the human cell that helps produce energy, could benefit from this gas. Researchers in this study noticed that when cells in arteries or veins experience damage or stress linked to certain conditions, these cells use the body’s own enzymes to create hydrogen sulfide. So the researchers created a compound they named AP39 that mimicked hydrogen sulfide. They then exposed cells in blood vessels to it. The result of this was that AP39 was as good as natural hydrogen sulfide at helping mitochondria protect themselves from disease. Another 2015 study which focused on the effects of A39 (Hydrogen Sulfide) suggested that A39 reduces blood pressure and cures a heart disease.  A similar research in 2018 looked at the evolution of hydrogen sulfide therapeutics to treat cardiovascular disease. Hydrogen sulfide which was referred to  as H2S in this study was said to broadly influence multiple signaling pathways. The study noted that H2S multiorgan protective effects render it a promising target for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. This conclusion was made seeing that in the past 5 to 10 years, substantial progress had been made in the development of novel H2S-generating compounds and in the understanding of the actions of H2S in the cardiovascular system.  Another study showed that coupling H2S generating diothiolethione (AP39) to a moiety well characterised to enable selective targeting of intracellular mitochondria  (TPP+) greatly increased the cytoprotective potency of H2S relative to a standard and non-targeted H2S donor compound GYY4137.  It added that selective pharmacological manipulation of mitochondrial H2S may represent a novel approach to preserving mitochondrial function and prevent oxidative stress-induced cellular injury in vivo.  A registrar at the National hospital, Dr U. J. Agim, an obstetrician and gynaecologist, told Dubawa that spread of this information can be harmful. He urged the public to avoid inhaling any source of the gas as it is when it comes in contact with cells that it is useful. “So inhaling H2S from the soak away, rotten egg or fart, or other method which it can be produced; either naturally or synthetically might be dangerous. Beside this has not been carried out on humans only in the petri dish and rats. This in the public space may result in the death of a lot of people. “It appears to be very useful but the real  H2S is harmful. No one should inhale from any source of the gas that could kill them. The compound H2S is introduced through different compounds e.g AP39. When in contact with cells, releases the useful H2S.” Another medical professional, Doctor Tarveshima Adongo, noted the studies used hydrogen sulfide donors which is different from it’s physical gaseous form. “In the body, compounds/chemicals are passed from one substance to another in various forms, this is quite different from the physical forms we feel. This study is looking at a hydrogen sulfide donor, which is different from its physical gaseous form. It’s also quite a technical study. It cannot be used to prove the usefulness or not of hydrogen sulfide in the body.” While there are benefits of flatulence/passing gas, there is no link between passing gas and living longer. Also, the claim that inhaling gas may prevent dementia is not true as all studies on the benefits of hydrogen sulfide were not carried out through inhaling the physical gas but by exposing the necessary body tissues or cells to a certain amount of the gas from donors. This makes both claims misleading. ",gas,29/11/2020,https://dubawa.org/misleading-meme-claims-passing-gas-makes-one-live-longer-prevent-diseases/
"Claim: A Facebook group shared 10 photographs, which it said were about the killing and brutalising of civilians in Obigbo, a community in Rivers State.","Biafra Today, a group on Facebook that is “all about Biafra and latest news,” shared 10 pictures on Sunday, November 1, which it said were about extrajudicial killings in Obigbo (Oyigbo), a town in Rivers State. “Nigerian Military unleashing terror on innocent Obigbo civilians under the guise of fishing out IPOB [Indigenous People of Biafra] family members on the orders of #govwikethemurderer,” it captioned the post.  “According to a report, hundreds have been killed and their bodies taken away as residents flee their homes while the media is silent on this massacre. We will never forget!!” The post was shared 835 times, liked by 283 Facebook users, and had 130 comments as of 1 pm on Friday. A study of the comments revealed that the vast majority of those who engaged with the post believed the pictures to be genuine. “Please send more proof, the UN [United Nations] must see this,” Lord Federal wrote, while another person criticised mainstream news outlets for being purveyors of fake news. Soldiers had in October invaded the Obigbo community to, according to the authorities, recover stolen weapons and capture criminals who killed six officials of the Nigerian Army. Their involvement has, however, been found to have led to the extrajudicial killing of unarmed residents. HumAngle ran reverse image searches on all 10 pictures and discovered that none of them was shot during the tragic event in Obigbo. The first picture, according to reverse image search results on TinEye, first appeared online when it was uploaded by Darak Online as far back as August 16, 2011. According to Getty Images, a supplier of stock images, the picture was taken by AFP photographer, Sia Kambou. It shows a soldier of the Republican Forces in Cote d’Ivoire (FRCI) “as he entered a house on April 27, 2011, in Abidjan during an attack against a militia group that helped drive former President Laurent Gbagbo from power”.  “The Republican Forces moved into Abidjan’s northern Abobo district in an offensive to dislodge fighters of former coup-plotter Ibarhim Coulibaly, who claims to command a 5,000-strong force. Ivory Coast’s new President Alassane Ouattara has urged armed groups to lay down weapons or be disarmed by force, as his government, which took power after strongman Gbagbo’s April 11 arrest, exerts authority in the crisis-hit country,” the platform further explained. The same photo has, however, been used in relation to the Obigbo attack by other social media accounts, such as in this tweet by Oliver Ugochi, which has been shared over 500 times.  The second picture appeared originally on the Internet on January 21, 2017, according to TinEye. Punch Newspaper, in a report published on the same day, said the picture was taken after a pro-Donald Trump rally by IPOB members in Port Harcourt, Rivers State capital, turned violent. The third, fourth, fifth, and ninth pictures were traced to the apprehension of people who allegedly looted shopping malls in Osun State on October 17. The arrests took place on October 25, with as many as 19 pictures circulating online. But then, the same set of four pictures was tweeted on November 1 by a handle called Biafra News, with the caption: “This is Obigbo, sporadic shooting, massive arrest, presently ongoing.” Pictures six and seven have not been published on the Internet for a long period. But while the former picture has been used in connection with the attacks in Obigbo since November 1, earlier posts like this one from October 27 stated that the picture was taken in Ilesha, Osun State. The seventh picture, according to an October 28 publication of Eons Intelligence, also shows officers of the Nigerian Air Force brutalising curfew defaulters in Ilesa. Later posts on social media, however, changed the context to fit into the Obigbo incident. A reverse image search revealed that the ninth picture shows people arrested and paraded in Lagos on the allegation that they rioted and stole during and following the End SARS demonstrations. The picture was released after the police command said it has arrested 520 suspected hoodlums. Finally, the tenth picture first appeared online on October 27. One of the first people to share it alongside other pictures was Uncle Anass on Twitter. “In Kaduna, it’s house to house operation in search of stolen palliatives by security operatives. Haba @elrufai,” he wrote in the caption, implying that the people seen lying on the ground were being probed by military personnel. None of the pictures was taken in Obigbo, Rivers State, during the raid by officials of the Nigerian military. Rather, they originated from other incidents in Port Harcourt, Osun, Lagos, Kaduna states, as well as Ivory Coast.

"CLAIM: Thunderstorm is often sent to destroy a person, animal, or thing unnaturally. It serves as vengeance or sanction for a wrong deed.","Belief about havoc wreaked by thunderstorms comes in two ways; sometimes mentioned to be a natural occurrence of strikes and other times, deep-rooted myth in some cultures. In the early 20th century, many researchers and philosophers looked into the relationship between religion, philosophy, and science in which the more sophisticated ways of observing the world replaced the older ways. Religion, on one hand, was often thought to arise from magic, and science must, on the other hand, assume the reality of its matters so that it minimizes a critical metaphysical attitude (Kelley & Berridge, 2002). Many people believe there are more to thunderstorms than just the upward movement of warm, moist air which cools, condenses, and forms a cumulonimbus cloud. In Rwanda, it is believed that witch doctors can traditionally use the term ‘thunder’ attributed in their activities as the same lightning phenomenon, which occurs in unplanned time and situation, striking their so-called “own enemies” and Nigeria is neither left out of similar belief.  According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA, as reported on the National Weather Service, so far this year, there have been 26 people reported to have been struck by lightning in the United States; out of which 12 were reported dead. Several cases have also been recorded in Nigeria. Premium Times reports that a herd of cattle was hit by a thunderstorm, killing eight cows at Ekan-Ile area of Ikare Akoko, in Akoko North-East Local Government area of Ondo State on the night of Tuesday October 24, 2019. Premium Times noted that it was the second time a thunderstorm would strike dead a large number of cows in Ondo State, ‘a development that had been described as mysterious’. On September 21, 2019, 36 cows were reported to have been destroyed by thunder in Ijare, in the Ifedore Local Government area of the State. Vanguard also reported on September 22, 2019, that the 36 cows, belonging to a herdsman identified as Ladam, were struck dead by lightning at Ijare’s sacred hill in Ifedore Local Government Area of Ondo State. The Hill, said to be only visited by the king of the town and some chiefs once in a year during the celebration of the new yam festival to perform some rituals, is suspected to be the cause of the cows’ death, as the incident was said to have been accompanied by a thunderstorm. Reacting to the 36 dead cows on behalf of the Ondo State traditional ruler, his second-in-command, the Sapetu of Ijare, Chief Wemimo Olaniran, said, “In the past, we did witness thunderbolt attacks when you desecrated any part of Ijare, particularly the areas designated for sacrifice- the grove. The dead cows will be there forever. It is part of the history in our land, for people to see as testimony in future that such a thing happens. A whole Oba was buried there live and heaven did not fall, talk less of ordinary cows. Oke-Owa is a sacred hill, where Oba and some of his chiefs visit once a year during the new yam festival to offer sacrifices on behalf of the community. Even those chiefs accompanying the Oba must not go to the inner part of the hill, because there is a particular place where only the Oba has to enter and spend a night. That is what these herdsmen wanted to desecrate with their herds. It is a taboo. Cattle market in our place is not a blessing, but a curse.” On Wednesday, January 8, 2020, BBC Pidgin reported that a farm in Pedregulho, inside Sao Paulo state, Southeast Brazil, lost so many cows to the strike of lightning during a recent storm. Brazil local media reported that the animals were destroyed when they ran under a tree to hide from heavy rain.  As primitive man sought answers about the natural world, lightning became a part of his superstitions, his myths, and his early religions. Early Greeks believed that lightning was a weapon of Zeus. Thunderbolts were invented by Athena, the goddess of wisdom. Since lightning was a manifestation of the gods, any spot struck by lightning was regarded as sacred. Greek and Roman temples often were erected at these sites, where the gods were worshipped in an attempt to appease them. Scandinavian mythology alludes to Thor, the thunderer, who was the foe of all demons. Thor tossed lightning bolts at his enemies. Thor also gave us Thurs-day. In the pantheistic Hindu religion, Indra was the god of heaven, lightning, rain, storms, and thunder. The Maruts used the thunderbolts as weapons. Umpundulo is the lightning bird-god of the Bantu tribesmen in Africa.  Even today their medicine men go out in storms and bid the lightning to strike far away, The Navajo Indians hold that lightning has great power in their healing rituals. Sand paintings show the lightning bolt as a wink in the Thunderbird’s eye. Even Santa Klaus gets into the act with his reindeer Donner (thunder) and Blitzen (lightning). Lightning is the most underrated weather hazard. It makes every single thunderstorm a potential killer, whether the storm produces one single bolt or ten thousand bolts. In the United States, lightning routinely kills more people each year than tornadoes and hurricanes combined. Tornadoes, hail, and wind gusts get the most attention, but only lightning can strike outside the storm itself. Lightning is the first thunderstorm hazard to arrive and the last to leave. In a simple definition, lightning is the bright line of light in the sky in a storm. There must be something responsible for the effect of thunderstorms on humans, animals, plants, and properties. This is what the scientists and philosophers call the ‘universal law of cause and effect’. Many scholars agree that for every effect, there is a definite cause, hence, the need to scientifically and religiously consider the causes of thunderstorms effects. In their study on ‘Lightning Myths versus Science Facts: Traditional Beliefs on Thunderstorms among Rwandans’, Ndihokubwayo Kizito and Nkundabakura Phéneas visited a witch doctor in order to ask what they thought about it. In a long talk held by witch doctor and his wife, living in Kagezi 2 sub- cell, Rwentanga cell near Nyabwishongwezi, Matimba sector in Nyagatare District, the researchers heard different heart striking stories both from the witch doctor, his wife and patients with them, these are: The witch doctor’s wife told the researchers that “as you can be poisoned and get mad, you can also be sent thunder and die on spot”.

Speaking during the 2020 edition of the MSMEs Awards held recently, Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo said workers would benefit from the Payroll Support Scheme the present regime has put in place for MSMEs to cushion the effect of the coronavirus pandemic. Osinbajo said the survival fund would help provide payroll support to MSMEs with a minimum of 10 and maximum of 50 staff members. He explained that the MSMEs that qualify for the fund would make available their payroll for verification by the government. “The target beneficiaries of this scheme will include private schools, hotels, road transport workers, creative industries and others. The verification process will be very rigorous and painstaking,” the Vice President said. So, how true is the claim that the beneficiaries are non-existent, imaginary and made up? The Senior Special Assistant to the Vice President on Media and Publicity, Laolu Akande, has debunked with videos and names the claim that the beneficiaries of the Payroll Support Scheme are fictitious.  Akande posted the video of a beneficiary from Abakaliki, Ebonyi State, Chimaobi Nwachukwu, in which he testified to have received the payroll support.  In the video, Nwachukwu said, “As a beneficiary to this FG wonderful programme, I want to say thank you for this great opportunity, now I feel more a Nigerian than ever.” Akande further disclosed another video and name of a beneficiary, Offor Modestus Ogadinma from Mushin, Lagos State with two workers paid.  Meanwhile, checks showed that several beneficiaries of the Payroll Support have shared their testimonies on social media. For instance, a Twitter user, Chuks Ogbonnaya (@Chukogbo) testified that his spouse’s workers got the salary support.  “I can testify that 4 of my wife’s employees benefited from this. She applied through the Enugu State SME Centre in October and they got paid N30k each this November. I didn’t take it seriously until I saw the alert. Business name is Blossom & Jenny,” he tweeted. Olusoga Owoeye (@olusogaowoeye) tweeted that two of his staff in Lagos were paid.  “I was told last week that 3 of our staff received 30k each in our small business in Lagos,” he tweeted.  Abdulazeez Abdulsalam (@Abdulaz93643945) confirmed that he got the payroll support, as well as his spouse and neighbours. “Myself, my older brother, my brother’s wife and 5 of my neighbours. We all received the 30k. Really grateful,” he tweeted.  In addition, the Special Assistant to the Vice President on Micro-Small and Medium and Medium Enterprises(MSMEs), Mr Tola Johnson, debunked the claim that the beneficiaries are fake.  When contacted on the claim, Mr Johnson, who is a member of the Steering Committee of the MSME Survival Fund, said the Federal Government has a comprehensive data of all beneficiaries, but would not be appropriate to release their names and Bank Verification Numbers (BVN). He said 25,000 employees from  Lagos, 17,000 from Kano, 16,000 from Abia, and 13,000 across other states have so far benefited from the payroll support. “We have real testimonies. We have people that have collected this money. It’s touching their lives and their families. We’ll keep ramping up the numbers,” he said.  Meanwhile, a simple arithmetic showed that 200 million Nigerians would not receive N15 million each from the N3.18 billion disbursed to the 101,567 beneficiaries by the Federal Government. The claim that the 101,567 beneficiaries of the N3.18 billion payroll support of the Federal Government were non-existent, imaginary and made up is false. The Federal Government has debunked the claim. Testimonies of several beneficiaries of the payroll support also discredit the claim. It is also false that 200 million Nigerians would have gotten N15 million each from the N3.18 billion said to have been disbursed. If shared among 200 million Nigerians, N3.18 billion would amount to N15.9 per Nigerian.

CLAIM: Senator Dino Melaye Claims that Joe Biden Knelt to apologize to the daughter of Gorge Floyd,"A former Senator representing Kogi West in the National Assembly, Senator Dino Melaye on Monday claimed that the US President-elect Joe Biden knelt to publicly apologize to the daughter of Geroge Floyd. “American President-elect publicly apologises to the daughter of George Floyd, a black American who was murdered by racist white American policemen. On behalf of the entire American Government and Citizens, I hereby apologise for the untimely death of ur dad. Can mallam B do this?” he wrote in a tweet. With over 2.2million followers on twitter, the post already generated almost 2,000 retweets and more than 11thousand likes. “Lipglouse reports that Former senator, Dino Melaye has compared Nigerian President Buhari with US President-elect, Joe Biden after Biden knelt down in the public and apologised to the daughter of George Floyd – a black American who was murdered by white American policemen.”, the blog posted. A Ghanian actor, Don Little, had also in an interview used the same picture to claim that Joe Biden knelt before him. That has been fact-checked and labelled False. George Perry Floyd Jr. was an African American man killed during an arrest in Minneapolis after a store clerk alleged he had passed a counterfeit $20 bill. A white police officer named Derek Chauvin knelt on Floyd’s neck for a period initially reported to be 8 minutes and 46 seconds. One of them is a news article by a media outlet, Detroit Free Press with the headline: ‘Joe Biden stops by Detroit’s Three Thirteen store, says he’s shopping for his grandkids’. As reported by the NewsHerald and UK Telegraph, Joe Biden was shopping for his grandkids in Detroit when he took pictures with the owners of the store, Clement Brown, who got a fist bump with Biden. Brown’s son C. J. Brown is the child in the picture with Biden. ABC News white house correspondent, Karen Travers, also posted some of the pictures on her twitter page. “Quick stop at Three Thirteen clothing store in Detroit for  @JoeBiden. He said he was buying for his grandkids. Store owner’s dad, Clement Brown, got a fist bump. Owner’s son, CJ, posed for some pics (but was shy-a lot of cameras there)” she wrote The said picture was also posted by Joe Biden on his verified Instagram handle on 15 September. The picture was accompanied by a write up that did not suggest the child was George Floyd’s daughter. “constant reminder of why I’m in this fight. We need to build an economy that gives them and their families a fair shot. We need to root out systemic racism so they grow up in a more just nation than we have now. We need to combat climate change so there’s a world left for them to thrive in. I believe in a better future for our children and will fight for them until the very end.” he wrote in a message accompanying the picture on Instagram. False. The Child in the Picture is not George Floyd’s daughter. He is a boy named C.J. Brown, the son of a store owner in Detroit where Joe Biden went shopping for his grandchildren.

"Claim: Information Minister, Lai Mohammed, has claimed that soldiers who attacked unarmed protesters used blank ammunition, and blank ammunition cannot do any damage to the flesh, not to talk of killing anyone","The attack of unarmed protesters by unidentified soldiers at the Lekki Toll gate in Lagos has generated several comments globally, in which authorities in Nigeria have denied directing soldiers to attack unarmed citizens. The military first denied knowledge of attacking protesters but later said it only fired blank bullets. Recently, the CNN investigation which supports other investigations done by prominent media organizations on Lekki shooting such as Premium Times, Peoples Gazette, Arise News among others, sprout out negative and positive comments from citizens including the government. The Minister of Information and culture, Lai Mohammed in a nationwide Press briefing claims soldiers at the Lekki toll gate fired blank bullet into the air, and “blank ammunition cannot do any damage to the flesh, not to talk of killing anyone”, adding that firing live ammunition into the crowd, as some have alleged, would have led to mass killing, which never happened. Dubawa did a google search which returned several articles on the subject.  In April 1993, The NewYork Times reported that Brando Lee, a 27 years actor, the son of a popular actor, Bruce Lee  died on the scene when he was shot by a gun with a blank bullet.  Mr. Lee was shot 20 feet away in his abdomen when he was filming the movie titled, “The Crow.” Also publications by Metalfloss on December 4, 2015 reveals in the year 1984 that an actor Jon Erik-Hexum died while on the set of CBS’s Cover-Up as a result of a blank cartridge. “Bored by incessant delays, the actor pointed a gun loaded with blanks to his head and reportedly said, Can you believe this crap?” before pulling the trigger,” the report added. He had pressed the barrel directly to his temple, and the force of the explosion still did incredible damage, even without a bullet. It drove a small chunk of his own skull into his brain, which caused severe hemorrhaging and put him in a coma. He died as a result of his injuries. Another publication in Forensic Science International Journal said the necks of three persons were badly injured as a result of loaded  blank ammunition. The weapon is said to have either been loaded by blank cartridges or tear gas cartridges which each victim died from blood loss as a result of ruptured cervical vessels..  Dubawa also reached out to a retired colonel Chinedu Owhonda for comments. Owhonda said blank ammunition can injure and kill someone, depending on the range it was shot from: “Blank ammunition can injure somebody, and can kill, it  also depends on the impact. If you fire someone at close range to the chest, definitely the person will have issues,” he said. Evidence gathered indicates that blank bullets can injure and kill someone. This makes False Lai Mohammed’s claim that blank ammunition cannot do any damage to the flesh, not to talk of killing anyone.

Claim: A video shared on Twitter claims to show a collection of Sport Utility Vehicles recently acquired by members of the Senate and House of Representatives.,"A Twitter user, Miz Cazorla (@MizCazorla1), on Tuesday shared a video which she said showed Sport Utility Vehicles (SUVs) recently bought by federal lawmakers are waiting to be distributed. “SUVs for senators and house of rep members ready for distribution in a country where ASUU has been on strike for close [to] one year and budget for education is less than 10%,” she tweeted, failing to specify when the video was shot. Speaking in Hausa, the person who recorded the video said: “If these cars are in your house, you will be in trouble. All EFCC [Economic and Financial Crimes Commission] officers in Nigeria will storm your house, wallahi.” The person he was addressing replied that that was not possible. The tweet was liked by over 730 Twitter users and shared well over a thousand times as of Wednesday, November 25. A screen recording has also been shared on WhatsApp. Comments showed many people who saw the video believed it to have been shot recently. “Where is this place, we need to visit,” wrote one Isaac Esonotu. Another person commented, “Just imagine how heartless dis Senators and House of rep members are. The Economy is crashing, ASUU is on strike, insecurity is on the raise [sic] and hunger is the order of the day. They await to share dis cars among themselves. Dis is the more reason why #sorosoke we raise [sic].” “If our senators and House of Reps members mean well for this nation, they should reject this SUV and ask the money to be channelled to ASUU in order to resolve this strike,” replied Jonah to the same tweet. Using InVID, a video verification tool, and the Google Reverse Image search, HumAngle traced the video to posts shared as far back as July 2020. On July 11, Weka Wazi Fikra Zako, Tanzanian-based platform on Facebook, shared a screenshot from the video, with a caption in Swahili: “All Nigerian MPs [Members of Parliament] are given a Lexus LX 570 car. This kind of car cost 30 million naira. These cars are from the resources of the nation which belong to all Nigerians, it is amazing to see MPs using expensive cars representing weak citizens in the country.” Similar posts were published between July 9 and 10 by Anioma Press, Anthony N Okoh, WakaAbout Community, among others. According to a publication by Nkiruka Nistoran, eyewitness reports stated that the cars were set to be distributed that week. “Their delivery was delayed by the transition of a new clark [sic.] of the National Assembly,” the blog claimed, adding that the cars were worth N50 billion. Though some have claimed that the cars in the video belonged to an automobile dealer, there is no conclusive evidence to either substantiate or refute this. The place in the cars were located in the video is apparently different from the parking lot at the National Assembly Complex in Abuja. The tight manner in which the cars are parked also suggests they were still in the custody of a dealer. Meanwhile, there have been no credible reports of plans to purchase new cars by the federal lawmakers in the second half of 2020. In 2016, the Senate confirmed buying 36 SUVs (one per state) for N36.5 million each after news spread that it purchased 108. In 2019, the upper legislative chamber again planned to spend N5.5 billion in getting an SUV for each of its members. “What is the problem there? It is an insult to say that a senator of the Federal Republic cannot ride a jeep in Nigeria. It is an insult,” said Senate leader Yahaya Abdullahi. In March, members of the House of Representatives were reported to have taken delivery of units of Toyota Camry 2020 model cars, whose prices were not disclosed. The house, however, described the report as “clear falsehood” shortly afterwards. The claim is misleading as the video has been circulated on the Internet since at least July 2020, over four months ago.

CLAIM: The federal government is giving out N3m grants to Nigerians.,"CLAIM: The federal government is giving out N3m grants to Nigerians. VERDICT: FALSE A viral post on WhatsApp claims that the Federal Government is giving out grants to young Nigerians as part of the Nigerian Youth Investment Fund (NYIF). The forward-as-received message attempts to direct readers to this website with a URL that indicates it’s of the Nigerian Youth Investment Fund. The post reads: “Don’t miss this federal government 3 Million grant. It takes fews seconds to apply. “Dont miss this great opportunity.  Apply Here http://nigerian-youth-investment-fund.cf.” Firstly, Dubawa observed that the URL does not contain the .gov domain as most Nigerian government websites do or the .ng domain which indicates that it’s Nigerian. Rather the website has a .cf domain which looks suspicious. Checks showed that the .cf domain is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for the Central African Republic. It is administered by the Central African Society of Telecommunications. On a second look, the URL does not contain the hypertext transfer protocol https://. It, however, contains http:// which indicates that the website is not secure or encrypted.  Checks on the website also showed that upon the submission of personal bank details, each applicant is expected to share certain messages on WhatsApp groups and/or accounts. Analysis using ScamDoc.com, a web tool that evaluates the reliability of “digital identities,” shows that the website has 1% trust score. Nigerian Tribune, thereafter, reached out to the Federal Ministry of Youths and Sports Development to ascertain the authenticity of the website. John Akanji, the Special Adviser Media to the Minister of Youths and Sports Development, Sunday Dare, told Nigerian Tribune that the website is fake. Akanji also made available to Nigerian Tribune, a press statement signed by the Director of Press at the ministry, Lere-Adams on November 19, 2020, warning Nigerians to be wary of a fake website asking them to pay training fee to access the NYIF. The press statement reads: “The Federal Ministry of Youth and Sports Development wishes to alert all Nigerian Youth and the general public about a fake link in circulation, inviting youth to access training at a fee.  “The link: https://nyif–edi.mystrikingly.com is FAKE and is not from the Federal Ministry of Youth and Sports.  “Application and Entrepreneurship Development Training for the Nigerian Youth Investment Fund (NYIF) is FREE. To apply log on to: https://nmfb.com.ng/nigeria-youth-investment-fund/” Akanji told Dubawa that the Nigerian Youth Investment Fund (NYIF) is a youth fund dedicated to investing in innovative ideas, skills, talents and enterprise of the Nigerian youth and aimed at turning them into entrepreneurs, wealth creators and employers of labour contributing to national development approved by the Federal Executive Council on July 22, 2020. He said: “The fund aims to reach 500,000 youths annually between 2020 and 2023. Each fund approval will range from N250, 000 to N50, 000,000, with a spread across group applications, individual applications, working capital loans set at 1 year and term loans set at 3 years with single digit interest rate of 5%. The funding will be a single digit facility and payable over a designated period. Some businesses may have longer repayment cycles but again the criteria will be clear once fully developed.” Even though eligible young Nigerians have been applying for grants under the Nigerian Youth Investment Fund, prospective applicants should be cautious of the platforms where they submit their details. Scammers and impostors on websites such as this earlier checked by Dubawa are on the prowl to obtain the personal details of unsuspecting Nigerians.

He also claimed that Governor Nasir el Rufai of Kaduna state plans to tax everyone above 18 in his state.","A popular medical doctor and social media influencer, #OurFavOnlineDoc (@DrOlufunmilayo) on Monday said that Oyo state IGR increased by 26.4% without increasing taxes. He also claimed that Governor Nasir el Rufai of Kaduna state plans to tax everyone above 18 in his state. “Seyi Makinde promised his government will never increase tax on any Oyo citizen. NBS report showed Oyo State IGR increased 26.4%, despite no extra taxes. But El Rufai plans to tax everyone  above 18 in his state- though he has not given everyone jobs.” he wrote in a tweet The tweet has since generated almost 2,000 retweets. CLAIM 1: Oyo State IGR increase by 26.4% without increasing taxes TRUE. Data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed that Oyo State generated 17.7billion naira revenue in the first half of year 2020 higher than the N14 Billion naira it generated in the first half of 2019.  CLAIM 2: Governor Nasir el Rufai plans to tax everyone above 18 years in Kaduna TRUE. Kaduna State government plans to tax everyone above 18 years 1,000 naira annually from 2021 CLAIM 1: Oyo State IGR increase by 26.4% without increasing taxes Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) is the revenue that state governments generate within the areas of their jurisdiction. The various sources of internal revenue available to state governments include taxes, fines and fees, licenses, earnings & sales, rent on government property, interests and dividends, among others. Although the claimants did not state a period he was referring to, we based our verification on data for the first half (H1) of 2020 given that he made the claim shortly after Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde, posted the same claim on his Twitter page. Efforts to make a definite clarification with him was unsuccessful as messages sent to him were unreplied.  “The Nigerian Bureau of Statistics (NBS) H1 2020 report shows that our IGR grew by 26.4% even amidst this pandemic. We did this without increasing the tax burden on our citizens. What we have done so far is to focus on our competitive advantage,” Makinde wrote. However, data from the National Bureau of Statistics show that Oyo state generated N17.7billion in the first half (H1) of 2020, higher than the N14 Billion it generated during the same period of 2019. Also, according to the National Bureau of Statistics, Oyo state revenue in the H1 of 2020 grew by 26.4% compared to the same period in 2019. Conclusion: Data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed that Oyo State generated 17.7billion naira revenue in H1 of 2020, higher than the N14 Billion naira the state generated in H1 2019. CLAIM 2: Governor Nasir el Rufai plans to tax everyone above 18 years in Kaduna Kaduna State Internal Revenue Service (KSIRS) had on November 10th announced that the state will begin charging adults a compulsory 1,000naira as Development Levy. “Payment of Development Levy is compulsory, citizens of Kaduna State from 18 years and above are entitled to pay their development Levy into Kaduna State Revenue Accounts, it’s your civic responsibility to pay your N1,000 as Development Levy.” it posted on its Twitter handle. Later, in an interview with DailyTrust, the executive chairman of KSIRS, Dr Zaid Abubakar, said the Economic Development Levy, which the organization will begin collecting from residents in 2021, will motivate the people to be entrepreneurs instead of staying idle.

Claim Two: Nowhere in the whole constitution was the word ‘secular’ ever used,"The Director, Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC), Professor Ishaq Akintola, recently made a number of claims concerning the Arabic script on the Naira. The Lagos-based group claimed that the script on the naira is not Arabic but ‘Ajami’; there was no mention of ‘secular’ in the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria; Israel’s currency has Arabic inscription; Arabic is not a foreign language because Shuwa Arabs in Borno State speak it and colonial masters inscribed Arabic on the currency printed by Britain and used in Nigeria.  Verdict: MOSTLY TRUE. The claims are mostly true apart from the misleading claim that Arabic is not a foreign language in Nigeria since Shuwa Arabs of Borno State use it. While Arabic is spoken  by the Shuwa Arabs, it was imported into Nigeria by traders and missionaries and is described as the oldest foreign language in the country.  Claim One: The inscription on Naira is not Arabic but ‘Ajami’ Verdict: TRUE. The inscription on the naira is Ajami Hausa, not Arabic.  On November 15, 2020, MURIC released a statement detailing its position on a recent suit against Arabic sign on the naira. A lawyer, Chief Malcolm Omirhobo, had dragged the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and others before the Federal High Court, Abuja, over the inscription of Arabic language on Naira notes. Reacting to the development, MURIC claimed that the said inscription on the Naira was not Arabic but Ajami. “Seeking to remove Arabic from the naira is the height of ignorance because Arabic is just a language like English or French, not a religion. By the way, what is on the naira is not even Arabic. It is ‘Ajami’ using Arabic letters as a form of transliteration,” MURIC claimed.  How true is the claim? An article written by Mannir Dan-Ali, former editor-in-chief of the Daily Trust newspaper, published on the BBC website, clarified that many seem unaware that the Arabic script on the naira is known as “Ajami”.  Dan-Ali explained that Ajami was the first means of literacy on the African continent, centuries before Western colonisers and Christian missionaries arrived with their Roman script and its A-Z alphabet. “Nana Asma’u, the daughter of Sheikh Usman Dan Fodio, who founded the Sokoto Caliphate, was a renowned and prolific poet – and probably the first woman to write several books in Hausa and Fulfulde using Ajami. More than 150 years after her death, it is Ajami Hausa, not Arabic, that is on the naira notes,” he wrote. Any non-Arab language written in Arabic script we call Ajami. The inscription on the naira is a transliteration of Hausa into Arabic. When contacted, a communication scholar at the University of Maiduguri, Professor Abubakar Mu’azu, said the sign on the naira is Arabic letters used to write the value of the denominations of the naira in Hausa.  “The Arabic letters used to write in Hausa is what is called Ajami. An Arab may read it but may not get the meaning unless he/she understands Hausa,” he said.  As far back as 1913, Frederick William Hugh Migeod wrote that writing in the Hausa language, using Arabic characters was common in Northern Nigeria and that Hausa so written is locally called Ajami, an Arabic word meaning simply ‘foreign.’ The inclusion of Ajami on the naira may not be unconnected to research finding that as many as 80 percent of Hausa-speakers in Africa can read and write Ajami.  Professor of science education and curriculum studies at Kano’s Bayero University, Abdalla Uba Adamu, observed that many of West Africa’s “unlettered” persons are still reading Ajami—on signs, in shops, in at least one weekly newspaper (Nigeria’s Alfijir), as well as in locally published books that range from romance novels to religious texts. It is true that the inscription on the naira is Ajami Hausa, not Arabic. Any non-Arab language written in Arabic script is known as Ajami. The inscription on the naira is a transliteration of Hausa into Arabic. Claim Two: Nowhere in the whole constitution was the word ‘secular’ ever used TRUE. An online word search of the 1999 constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria showed that ‘secular’ was not used in the document.  MURIC claimed that  there is nowhere in the whole constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria was the word ‘secular’ ever used. “The Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 says inter alia at its very beginning, ‘We the people of the Federal Republic of Nigeria: having firmly and solemnly resolved : to live in unity and harmony as one indivisible and indissoluble sovereign Nation under God…’ So how can Nigeria be a secular state when we are ‘under God’? In addition, nowhere in the whole constitution was the word ‘secular’ ever used and we challenge anyone who can find that word from the constitution to mention the chapter, section and subsection,” MURIC claimed. An online search of ‘secular’ did not return results throughout the provisions of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. Similarly, a lawyer, Osita Nnamani Ogbu, wrote in an article entitled, “Is Nigeria a Secular State? Law, Human Rights and Religion in Context,” that there was no mention of ‘secular’ in the 1999 constitution. “The 1999 Constitution did not expressly proclaim Nigeria to be a secular state,” Ogbu wrote in the article.   Ogbu observed that though the constitution did not “expressly proclaim” Nigeria a secular state, “it prohibits both states and the Federal Government from adopting any religion as state religion; and guarantees to every person the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion as well as the right to freedom from discrimination on grounds, inter alia, of religion.” An article written by Engr. Dauda Ayanda and published in the Guardian posited that the often cited section of Nigerian Constitution on the provision of a secular state is Section 10 of 1999 Constitution, which reads thus: The Government of the federation or of a state shall not adopt any religion as state religion.  “This constitutional provision is wrongly interpreted by some advocates of secularism to mean a secular state. This is more compounded by the fact that there is no legal pronouncement on the particular section of the Constitution,”  Engr. Ayanda wrote. He concluded that “the logical interpretation of the provision is that a single religion is prohibited from being imposed on all the citizens of the country. In other words, Nigeria is a non-theocratic, multi-religious and multi-cultural state.” It is true that there was no mention of ‘secular’ in the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. An online search of ‘secular’ in the constitution returned no result.  Claim Three: Israel’s currency has Arabic inscription  TRUE. Arabic is one of the two official languages of Israel and as such is included on official documents and signs, including the country’s currency.  As part of several claims made by MURIC to protest the suit against Arabic script on the naira, the group claimed that Israel’s currency has Arabic inscription on it. “Nigerian Christians who go on pilgrimage to Jerusalem every year spend Israel’s money and see Arabic on it,” MURIC claimed. How true is the claim? The Israeli new shekel, which is the currency of Israel and is also used as a legal tender in the Palestinian territories of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, has Arabic inscription on it, just as the 200 New Shekels pictured above.  Note that it is enshrined in Israeli law that Hebrew and Arabic are official languages of the State, and all public documents, including the currency, must be printed in both languages.  It is also noteworthy  that Israeli Arabs, who speak Arabic, are the biggest minority in Israel, constituting about 20% of Israel’s population. It is true that Arabic is included on Israel’s currency. Arabic is one of the two official languages of Israel and as such must be included on official documents and signs, including the country’s currency.  Claim Four: Arabic is spoken by Nigeria’s Shuwa Arabs in Borno State.   Misleading. While Arabic is “used”  by the Shuwa Arabs in Borno State, it was imported into Nigeria and is described as the oldest foreign language in the country.  MURIC claimed that Arabic is not a foreign language as it is “used” by the Shuwa Arabs in Borno State:   “One major argument against the removal of Arabic from the naira is that a large percentage of the Nigerian population will be cut off from our monetary system if Arabic is removed from the naira because Arabic is one of the local languages in Nigeria. It is used by the Shuwa Arabs in Borno State. Therefore Arabic cannot be a foreign language.” Evidence suggests that many Arabs settled in the Northeast of the country for the past 300 years. Centuries later, their features, culture, language, and origin remain Arabic. Dr. Mahmud Adesina Ayuba of the Department of Religion & African Culture, Adekunle Ajasin University, Akungba – Akoko, Ondo State, described Arabic as the language of Shuwa Arabs, a tribe in Borno State of Nigeria. “Historically, Arabic is the oldest foreign language in Nigeria today. The reason is that its entry into the country dated back to the seventh century of the Christian era and the first century of the Hijrah Calendar. Centuries before the advent of Europeans in Nigeria, Arabic had been used for religious, social and cultural purposes,” Dr Ayuba added.  Note that while he explained that Arabic is the language of the Shuwa Arabs, he added that it was one of the oldest foreign languages in Nigeria.  Similarly, two Arabic Scholars from University of Ilorin, Lateef Onireti Ibraheem and Isa Alabi Abubakar posited that Arabic came into the country through the Arab traders and became deeply entrenched among the Shuwa Arabs with the help of the establishment of Islamic empires and emirates.  “Arabic further developed by itinerary scholars who passed through the country on their way to perform Hajj in Makkah. The advent of the British colonialists and Christianity slowed down its growth in the 20th century and later it gained strength with the establishment of Private Arabic Schools and the embarkation of students on scholarship to study abroad,” the scholars wrote. They observed that Arabic has actually become one of the languages of social interaction and that Nigerians have imbibed a great deal of Arabic. The Shuwa ethnic group is spread across Borno State and other countries sharing border with Chad and Cameroon Republics, close to the Lake Chad Basin. The term Shuwa is peculiar to the region in the tip of northeastern Nigeria, where it is used by the majority of non-Arabs to describe the Arabic speakers among them. Historically, Nigerian Arabs are nomads who were socio-culturally described as Baggara. Their movement from one place to another is necessitated by their cattle’s constant needs for grazing land.  It is misleading to claim that Arabic is not a foreign language in Nigeria because Borno’s Shuwa Arabs “use” it. While Arabic is spoken  by the Shuwa Arabs, it was imported into Nigeria and is described as the oldest foreign language in the country.  Claim Five: Colonial masters inscribed Arabic on the currency printed by Britain and used in Nigeria TRUE. Arabic script appeared on some currencies used in Nigeria during colonial rule.  MURIC also claimed that the British Pound, used in Nigeria before the advent of the naira, had Arabic script on it. “Even the colonial masters inscribed Arabic on the currency printed by Britain and used in Nigeria. The words: ‘pound daya’, i.e. one pound was inscribed on colonial currency. Omirhobo may therefore need to sue the Queen of England,” MURIC stated.  How true is the claim? The Nigerian naira replaced the country’s use of the Nigerian pound in 1973. The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) traced the first major currency issued in Nigeria to the colonial ordinance of 1880 which introduced the Shillings and Pence as the legal tender currency in British West Africa. The units of coins managed by the Bank of England were one shilling, one penny, 1/2 penny and 1/10 penny and were distributed by a private bank, the Bank for British West Africa till 1912. From 1912 to 1959, the West African Currency Board (WACB) issued the first set of banknotes and coins in Nigeria, Ghana, Sierra Leone, and the Gambia. The highest banknote denomination was one pound, while the one shilling coin was the highest coin denomination. An archivist in Kaduna, Musa Muhammad,  confirmed that Arabic script had been printed on nearly every previous currency used in Nigeria before the naira.   Muhammad showed the New Yorker a tenth-of-a-penny coin minted in 1945, under the British colonial regime, and three languages were stamped on its silvery face: King George VI’s name appeared in Latin, and the coin’s value was spelled out in both English and Hausa, with the latter spelled out in Arabic. It is true that British colonial masters inscribed Arabic on the currency printed by Britain and used in Nigeria. Pictorial evidence and expert testimony proved that Arabic script appeared on some currencies used in Nigeria during colonial rule.

Claim: The Academic Staff Union of Universities has suspended its ongoing strike,"On 21st November 2020, a Twitter handle @ASUUNGR_ claimed that the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) has suspended its ongoing industrial action following a meeting with the federal government on November 20th, 2020 which bordered on addressing the demands of the university lecturers. The tweet which was posted at around 1:19 pm has gathered 2,552 likes and 350 retweets as of 3:18 pm University lecturers in Nigeria, on March 9th, 2020,  declared a two-week warning strike to protest against the insistence of the federal government to enroll the lecturers into a new payroll software it has developed for all public officials, the Integrated Pay cash roll and Personnel Information System (IPPIS). ASUU said the new payment system does not address some characteristics peculiar to the Nigerian University system. Upon the expiration of the warning strike, the union declared an indefinite strike to further their demands. This coincided with the closure of schools by the federal government to stifle the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. On one of the meetings arranged to resolve the lingering strike which has been one of the reasons students have not returned to schools after the reopening of schools as a result of the declining cases of the coronavirus pandemic, the leadership of the Union rejected the offer by the Federal Government’s team to pay the salary of the lecturers and the 30b earned allowance, using IPPIS pending the roll-out of the union’s preferred payment platform, University Transparency and Accountability Solution (UTAS) In a twist of events, the union had another meeting with the federal government which was seen as a major breakthrough in the effort to resolve the strike.  The meeting which was held on November, 21st, 2020, saw the federal government relaxing its stance on the enrollment of the university lecturers into the new payment software, IPPIS. The Union’s outstanding salaries, the government offered to pay through the old payment platform, GIFMIS, pending the outcome of the result of the integrity test to which the Union’s University Transparency and  Accountability Solution (UTAS) has been subjected. The federal government also offered a total sum of N65 billion to the Union to address the issue of earned allowances and funds for revitalisation of universities. To verify the claim, The ICIR contacted the national president of the Union, Prof Biodun Ogunyemi, who debunked the viral information, stating that the Union has not suspended its strike. “We don’t have a Twitter handle. I don’t know anything about the strike suspension because we don’t suspend our strike like that.” He clarified pointedly. Based on the above findings, the claim that the university lecturers have suspended the ongoing strike is FALSE as the Union reiterates that it has no Twitter handle.

"In January 2020, a Lagos based lawyer, Malcome Omirhobo, filed a suit before the Federal High Court against the Federal Government, Central  Bank of Nigeria (CBN), and others over Arabic inscription on Naira notes.","In January 2020, a Lagos based lawyer, Malcome Omirhobo, filed a suit before the Federal High Court against the Federal Government, Central  Bank of Nigeria (CBN), and others over Arabic inscription on Naira notes. The lawyer asked the court to absolve the CBN of the mandate to print and circulate Naira notes bearing Arabic inscriptions as a legal tender for a secular state that has English as its official language.  Omirhobo is of the view that the presence of the Arabic inscriptions on the Naira notes contravened the provisions of section 10 and 55 of the Nigerian constitution and is in a bid to Islamize the Nigerian state.  It is against this backdrop that a Nigeria-based Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC), a group which claims to position itself as a human rights organization promoting,  protecting, and projecting the rights of Muslims, made a couple of claims regarding the claims about the Bible and Arabic inscription on Naira currency. MURIC’s claims, projecting ‘facts’, mostly counters arguments of the lawyers and other people against the said Arabic inscription on Nigeria’s Naira. Mostly true  Verification: According to Encyclopedia Britannica Al-Khwārizmī, whose full name was Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī, (born c. 780 —died c. 850), is a Muslim mathematician and astronomer whose major works introduced Hindu-Arabic numerals and the concepts of algebra into European mathematics. It also states that the hindu-Arabic numerals consisting of a set of 10 symbols – 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0 – originated in India in the 6th or 7th century and were introduced to Europe through the writings of Middle Eastern mathematicians, especially al-Khwarizmi and al-Kindi, about the 12th century. Also, G J Toomer, in the Biography in Dictionary of Scientific Biography (New York 1970-1990)  stated that – it is likely enough that the decimal place-value system was a fairly recent arrival from India and that al-Khwārizmīs’ work was the first to expound it systematically.  A quote attributed to Mohammad Kahn cited in the book – The Muslim contribution to mathematics by A A al’Daffa (London, 1978) states inter alia – In the foremost rank of mathematicians of all time stands Al-Khwarizmi. He composed the oldest works on arithmetic and algebra…..The work on arithmetic first introduced the Hindu numbers to Europe…. A report from the 14th Institute of Electrical  and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) Conference held in Uzbekistan in October 2020 also attributed the introduction of Arabic numerals to the West to Al-Khwarizmi. Conclusion: All the publications that attributed the Arabic numerals to Al-Khwarizmi stated that he introduced the numerals to the West and the European countries. None of them established the fact that it was invented by him.  “Interestingly enough, God is called Allah in the Arabic Bible,” as quoted in the statement. True  Verification: Encyclopedia Britannica states that Allah is the standard Arabic word for God and is used by Arabic-speaking Christians and Jews as well as by Muslims. According to the Encyclopedia – it is believed that God described himself in the Arabic language as Allāh. A website christiananswers.net in a post answering to why Arab Christians referred to God as Allah stated – And what about the 10 to 12 million Arab Christians today? They have been calling God ‘Allah’ in their Bibles, hymns, poems, writings, and worship for over nineteen centuries Also an Arabic Bible Outreach Ministry on its website clarified that the first-known translation of the Bible into Arabic, which took place in the 9th century, uses the word Allah for God and that Arab Christians were using the word Allah for God prior to the dawn of Islam…. Similarly a post on Medium by Fatima Karim explaining the similarities between the Muslim and Christian “Allah” posited that – If you pick up an Arabic Bible, you will see the word “Allah” being used where “God” is used in English. This is because “Allah” is a word in the Arabic language equivalent to the English word “God” with a capital “G”.  Fatima used the visualisation below to support her assertion. Dubawa went ahead to download an Arabic Bible with English translation to verify further. In verse 11 of Mark Chapter 3, we see that “You are the son of God!” written in the English version is in quotes with an exclamation.   Dubawa traced the exact quote with an exclamation to the Arabic version and saw that the Arabic writing for God is similar to what is seen in the visualisation made by FatimaKarim.   Also in an audio Bible on YouTube, the reader is heard mentioning the word Allah while reading out loud the book of John.  Conclusion: Several search results supported the claim that the Arabic Bible refers to God as “Allah”  “It was not even Nigerian Muslim leaders who brought the idea of Arabic in the Nigerian currency in post-independence Nigeria. The man who initiated it was a Christian, an Urhobo officer, by name General David Akpode Ejoor (rtd). He was the one who introduced the Arabic inscription and the Star emblem into the Nigeria Army crest,” as quoted in the statement. Partially True  Verification: A blog post on Urhobo Voice attributed the designing of the Army cap badge to David Ejoor while rendering him a tribute after his death in 2019 – it read – The officer who designed the Army Cap Badge and Rank insignias in 1962. Also, David Ejoor in page 16 of his book Reminiscences  stated that the idea behind the Arabic inscription and star emblem introduced into the Nigerian cap badge was for Defence and Unity, which are part of what the Nigerian Army stands for – to defend the unity and integrity of Nigeria.  In page 16 of the book, Ejoor wrote, “In seeking a new design, I was anxious that the symbol should reflect the duty of the army and should be capable of inspiring officers and men. As I searched, I remembered the battle between the British and the Sokoto forces in 1903. At that battle, the Sokoto forces had carried the Sultan’s flag with an Arabic inscription on it. That Arabic inscription I learnt meant, “VICTORY IS FROM GOD ALONE”. However, submission by the CBN in response to the suit by the Lagos-based lawyer did not support the claim that David Ejoor initiated the Arabic inscription on the Naira. CBN noted that the inscriptions on the naira notes dates back to the colonial era. The CBN explained that “the naira notes retained the inscriptions with Ajami since 1973 when the name of the Nigerian currency was changed to naira from pounds. “The Ajami was inscribed on the country’s currency by the colonialists to aid those without Western education in certain parts of the country, who, back then, constituted a larger part of the populace.” Also, a New Yorker report reiterates this assertion. In the report by Caelainn Hogan, the reporter interviews an archivist who says the “Arabic script, had been printed on nearly every note since the naira was introduced, in 1973, and on previous currency as well.” The archivist was able to show this reporter a piece minted in 1945 as evidence that the British pounds used in Nigeria during the colonial era prior to the advent of the Naira had Arabic inscriptions on them.  To further verify this claim, Dubawa reached out to a PhD student of African History at the Michigan State University, Ozibo Ozibo. He could not confirm that it was General David Akpode Ejoor (Rtd) that brought the idea of the Arabic in the Nigerian currency in post-independence Nigeria but he, however, provided pictorial evidence that showed the Arabic inscription was on the British Pound used in Nigeria during the colonial era. Conclusion: Apart from his book where he tried to document history, no other strong indications point to that fact that it was Ejoor who introduced the Arabic writing into the Army cap badge. However, while there was some evidence to show that David Ejoor introduced the Arabic inscription on the Nigeria cap badge, several searches did not return results that show he was the one that introduced it into the Nigerian currency.  “Many of those saddled with the task of uniting us have become instruments of division. Ex-President Jonathan is an example. He removed Arabic from the naira because he listened to hate preachers whom he took along on his futile but numerous trips to Jerusalem,” as quoted in the statement.  Misleading  Verification: An observation of the Nigerian Naira notes show that the Arabic inscriptions are only absent in the 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 Naira denominations of the Naira while the 200, 500 and 1000 Naira notes still have the Arabic inscriptions. Also, reports show that it was only the Arabic inscription  on the 100 Naira note that was removed under Goodluck Jonathan ‘s administration when the note was redesigned by the CBN to commemorate 100 years of Nigeria’s amalgamation.  However, the Arabic inscriptions in the 5, 10, 20, 50 Naira notes were removed during the regime of President Olusegun Obasanjo  and not under President Goodluck Jonathan.  Meanwhile, the Naira is regarded as Nigeria’s monetary unit; it is the official currency for the Federal Republic of Nigeria and is divided into 100 Kobos. It was introduced in 1973 to replace the British pound which was in use during the  colonial era. The CBN has the sole authority to issue banknotes and coins. Coin  denominations range from 50 kobo to 2 naira while Banknotes are denominated in values from five to 1000 Naira. If the Naira is an official legal tender that encompasses all denominations of the Nigerian currency, it cannot be said that Goodluck Jonathan removed Arabic inscriptions from the Naira because the 100 Naira banknote is not the only Nigerian Naira.  Conclusion: It cannot be said that ex-president Goodluck Jonathan removed Arabic from the Naira when there are still Nigerian currencies bearing the Arabic inscription. This claim is therefore misleading.

"Claim: A user on Facebook, in a bind to the Nigerian context, claims that there is an ongoing protest in Algeria demanding that all political officials vacate office before elections.","The EndSARS protest has been a source of both controversy and discussion of public interest. Nonetheless, one thing that has also become evident since the protest is the plethora of narratives linked to it. This range of narratives is sometimes carved from videos, photos, or even quotes made by popular persons. While some of the sources are authentic, some are hoaxes and others are a mishmash of both.  It’s in line with this reality, that a Facebook user, ‘Ayodele Adeyele Freedom Rhymer’ via a Facebook group ‘Abusites Home and Abroad’ shared a picture of what appears to be a crowd of people protesting on the streets, who the claimant scooped to be Algerians protesting for the complete overhaul of the entire government officials without elections. The narrative shared alongside the picture seems to share a sense of recency as the user links it to the Nigerian situation. His words, tagged alongside the photo  stated:   “Algerians on the street protesting for 2 days now, no movement of vehicles, all shops have been locked up, even soldiers and police joined them in the protest, saying they are not waiting for election, that they want them all out of political offices. The day we will have this type of protest in Nigeria, that day we all will be free.” The post was shared on Wednesday 17th, November and the narrative appears to suggest that the situation is currently ongoing in Algeria. It has already attracted 59 reactions, 60 comments, and 9 shares within 24hrs of its appearance. As expected,  the post spawned a  debate amongst commenters with multiple views. One user, Ja’far Adamu conveyed that: “Yes, we all supported them here cos they are fighting for just course. It is widely accepted so it is popular protest. I cannot see anywhere being set ablaze, no chaos, no looting of shops, no intimidation, no victimization, no vandalization and that is what is termed peaceful protest. The protest is coordinated and they have leaders unlike the unpopular #EndSARS protest we had in Nigeria that ended up with a lot of casualties.” However, another user, Abdulrazag Jibril argued that: “This is not a protest” another user, Nazeer Abdullahi Bachirawa even posed the post as “fake news. This is a carnival” he contested. Whatever the case may be, the post has obviously stirred up a debate which Dubawa opts to uncover.  Dubawa carried out a preliminary analysis of the picture on Invid multimedia verifier shared by its source and the actual narrative behind it.  The picture was uncovered to have been first shared on a news website called “www. socialist.ca” on March 20, 2019.  While the actual narrative about the picture was confirmed to have been taken during the Algerian protest in 2019 to condemn  President Abdelaziz Bouteflika’s intention to pursue a fifth term in the Algerian 2019 April elections,  the protests began on February 22nd, 2019 in some towns and then escalated fast around the country. However, contrary to the claimant’s narrative,  the protest took place in 2019, lasted for more than two days, and was aimed at bringing about an end to Mr. Bouteflika’s reign.  The main reason that triggered the protest concerns the fact that Bouteflika has been president for four consecutive terms while seeking a fifth term.  Though the picture was taken from Algeria during a protest. Findings contradict the claimant’s narrative as the photo has been in existence since 2019 and was not because of the claimant’s reasons: “They are not waiting for election, That they want them all out of political offices.”  The picture was simply a protest to dissuade President Abdelaziz Bouteflika from his intentions to pursue a fifth term in office.  Hence, this claim is misleading.  ",claims,20/11/2020,https://dubawa.org/no-ongoing-protest-in-algeria-as-claimed-in-this-photo/
Claim: A WhatsApp post claims ASUU has suspended its strike action indefinitely,"A WhatsApp post circulated on Thursday, November 19, 2020, indicated that Academic Staff Union Universities, ASUU, has suspended its ongoing strike indefinitely.  The post, containing a statement, supposedly issued and signed by the Union’s President on Wednesday, November 18, 2020, noted that the suspension was as a result of the union’s meeting with the Federal Government, sequel to the Memorandum of Action signed between the two parties. A portion of the letter reads: “The Academic Staff Union of Universities, ASUU, following a meeting held with the Federal Government on Monday 16th, November 2020 sequel to the Memorandum of Action signed between ASUU and the Federal Government, has on Wednesday, 18th November 2020, suspended the over seven months -old strike it embarked upon since Sunday, 4th April, 2020.  “The action of 2020 was suspended following the signing of a Memorandum of Action (MoA) in which the Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) promised to address the contentious issues within a timeline that was to end in February 2021”. It would be recalled that the Academic Staff Union of Universities, ASUU, in a statement made available on Sunday, November 8, 2020, in Abuja, had urged the Federal Government to leave the Integrated Payroll Personnel Information System (IPPIS) as a condition to call off its ongoing strike in the country. ASUU had embarked on a nationwide strike on March 23, 2020, to press on its demands which, according to a Zonal Coordinator of ASUU, Prof. Ade Adejumo, includes: “The need for appropriate officers to obey universities laws and abide by collective bargaining agreements. “The need for the implementation of all outstanding provisions in the 7th February 2019 FGN/ASUU Memorandum of Action. “The need to re-commence and conclude the Re-negotiation of the 2009 FGN/ASUU Agreement, based on ILOs collective bargaining principles within the six-week timeframe originally set for it. “The need for Mr President, as a visitor to the Federal Universities, to constitute and activate Visitation Panels to all Universities and direct that the outcomes be fully implemented.” The ASUU chieftain also said that “Government should welcome ASUUs ongoing innovation of a more robust system. In response to an inquiry by a Dubawa writer, ASUU President, Biodun Ogunyemi, tagged the post ‘FAKE NEWS!’  Corroborating, the chairman of the Union at the University of Ibadan, Prof. Ayo Akinwole, debunked the rumour, saying that the Union will release a statement to debunk it. The Assistant Secretary of ASUU, UI Chapter, Dr Kazeem Olaniyan described the post as a propaganda by the government. He noted that there is a process the union follows before calling off a strike but such process has not been initiated.  “If they have a very successful and truthful negotiation, then, these our negotiation team of ASUU will go back to have a meeting with NEC after the meeting of POs (the POs are the Principal Officers), they will have a meeting with Zonal Coordinators, then they will have a NEC meeting. After the NEC meetings, they will send words to the Branches that “this is what we got from the Government, what is the way forward? Should we call off the strike? If you are in support, say Yes, if you are not in support, say No”. All the Branches of ASUU will now respond in their respective congresses to take a decisive action whether to say this strike has ended or to say this strike still continues.”  Dr Olaniyan further stated that the decision of each Congress does not automatically take effect until it gets its decisions back to NEC, which then announces the result of the collated decisions and resolutions from the congresses.  Also speaking, the ASUU Chairman, UNILAG Chapter, Dr Dele Ashiru noted that the news is a lie from the pit of hell. He revealed that the Federal Government is not being sincere with the whole issue. The Chairman who is a member of the Union’s NEC, said the Union still stands on the fulfilment of its demand. Recently, Dubawa has done some fact-checks on claims by ASUU parody accounts on Twitter: On November 15, 2020, a report by Daily Post claims the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) asked students to prepare for resumption next week. The report, which was later found to be false, was credited to a post by what it described as ASUU’s official Twitter page.  Earlier, a news report claimed that ASUU urged students to acquire new skills, travel, and have fun, implying there is no end to the strike in sight. This was also found to be false as the tweet did not emanate from ASUU. The claim that ASUU has suspended its ongoing strike indefinitely is misleading as ASUU has denied this.

"Claim 1: Repentant Boko Haram are paid N150,000 monthly","A twitter forum, PDP Vanguard (@PDPVanguard), with over 91,000 followers, claimed that repentant Boko Haram members earn N150,000 monthly.  The twitter forum has its bio as “Official Twitter Handle of #PDPVanguard Forum. Dedicated 4 @OfficialPDPNig.”  “Something that you can only found in @MBuhari”s Nigeria: Soldiers are being paid 65,000 as monthly salaries; while repentant Boko Haram terrorists are being paid 150,000 as monthly stipend,” the tweet reads.  This claim has also been amplified by other twitter users such as Nubari Saatah (@Saatah), who tweeted, “So ‘Ex militants’ are paid less than 100k monthly stipend and ‘repentant’ Boko Haram members are paid 160k? Omo. Shame dey catch me everyday for this Niger Delta.” Similarly, another twitter user, Demagogue (@von_Bismack) claimed the repentant Boko Haram earns N150,000 monthly. “How can the FG propose  to pay “Repentant” Boko Haram members 150k monthly? What’s the basis? This is rubbish. Our policemen, service men, civil servants and Corp members are not even paid such? It appears being a militant is more lucrative than any other enterprise in Nigeria,” he tweeted. The Federal government of Nigeria, through the Defence Headquarters, inaugurated Operation Safe Corridor (OSC) in 2015.  Centre for Democracy and Development (CDD) posited that the programme’s aim was to rehabilitate Boko Haram militants and reintegrate the “repentant” ones back into their respective communities as productive law-abiding citizens.  “The defecting members will acquire vocational training and access training in civics and de-radicalisation, to become useful members of their society upon release from the program. Since OSC’s commencement in May 2016, many have expressed strong reservation and criticism against the programme,” CDD stated.  The International Centre for Investigative Journalism reported that the Nigerian military is waging the Boko Haram war with kinetic and non-kinetic strategies. The Centre reported that kinetic is the hard-knock Operation LAFIYA DOLE; the non-kinetic is the soft-slap Operation SAFE CORRIDOR. “Operation SAFE CORRIDOR is what its name says: providing repentant members of Boko Haram/Islamic West Africa State Province a SAFE CORRIDOR to return to society,” the Centre reported.  In July 2020, the Defence Headquarters announced that it reintegrated 601 repentant Boko Haram terrorists including 14 foreign nationals from Cameroon, Chad, and Niger into the society through their respective national and state authorities. The Coordinator of Operation Safe Corridor, Major General Bamidele Shafa, said that the concept of Operation Safe Corridor was a unique non-kinetic operation aimed at giving hope to ex-combatants, who willingly give up their arms to embrace peace. The Federal Government has debunked the claim that repentant Boko Haram members are on a monthly remuneration of N150,000. The Personal Assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari on New Media, Bashir Ahmed, posted on his twitter handle, @BashirAhmaad, that the claim that repentant Boko Haram members earned monthly remuneration is false.  “FAKE NEWS ALERT: The Federal Government is NOT planning to start paying repented Boko Haram members N150,000 monthly, the story is baseless and should be regarded as the usual fake news. When you see it here or on WhatsApp, ask the poster to provide a credible source of the story,” he tweeted.  Similarly, a report published by Daily Post Nigeria also debunked the claim.  Similarly, the Special Assistant to thePresident on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, has said that repentant Boko Haram members have not been employed in the Military and this also means the said monthly remuneration would not also be for those employed in the military. However, contrary to the claim that repentant Boko Haram members receive N150,000 stipend, the Government of Borno state has revealed that the repentant terrorists reintegrated into their communities were given N20,000 stipends and some basic equipment to start their respective vocations. The Borno State Commissioner for Information, Babakura Jatau, said the funds and the starter packs were given to the repentant terrorists by the North East Development Commission (NEDC) and the International Organisation for Migration. Meanwhile, in February, 2020, Vanguard reported that following the commencement of the payment of the new minimum wage in January 2020, a Private Soldier was paid the sum of N50, 000 as salary, with only N2,000 increment from the previous N48,000 salary. The report said the Private Soldiers were underpaid compared to their colleagues in the Nigerian Navy and Nigerian Air Force, who received the sum of N74,000 each, translating to an increment of N23,000. A subsequent report by Vanguard revealed that the discrepancy was sorted out, thereby bringing the salary of a Private Soldier to N70,000 currently.  Evidence shows that repentant Boko Haram members are not on N150,000 remuneration. The Federal Government has debunked the claim. At best, evidence shows some of them got a one-off grant of N20,000 to start their respective trades. Meanwhile, the claim that soldiers in Nigeria earn N65,000 monthly is False. Following the implementation of the new minimum wage this year, Soldiers in Nigeria currently earn N70,000 and above.

CLAIM:  A viral post on WhatsApp claims successful N-Power candidates have been shortlisted.,"CLAIM:  A viral post on WhatsApp claims successful N-Power candidates have been shortlisted. FALSE. Based on these findings and response by the supervising ministry in charge of the N-Power programme, the claim is false  A viral post on WhatsApp claims successful N-Power candidates have been shortlisted for the next batch of the programme. The forwarded-as-received post attempts to direct the public to https://n-power-list.bid in order to ascertain if they have been shortlisted. The post reads: “Check your name on the N-Power Shortlisted names. Documentation will commence immediately. Click Here https://n-power-list.bid.” Dubawa sighted this post on multiple groups on the instant messaging app. N-Power is a scheme set up by the President of Nigeria, Muhammadu Buhari since 8 June 2016, to address the issues of youth unemployment and help increase social development. It was created as a component of the National Social Investment Program and is now under the supervision of the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development. On 26 June 2020, online enrolment for N-Power Batch C beneficiaries commenced and within 48 hours, more than 1 million applications were received on the online registration portal. When Dubawa visited the purported website, the landing page looked similar to N-Power website. The website asked this reporter to input a phone number registered for the N-Power programme. This reporter added a disconnected phone number that was never registered on N-Power platform. This reporter was thereafter congratulated for making the shortlist. The notification on the website reads “Congratulations, you have been shortlisted for the N-power Program! “You will be reached through email on the next thing to do. Always ensure you check your E-mail frequently. “How to Start Documentation? “1. To start your documentation, First click the green button “WHATSAPP” and send this information to 12 groups on WhatsApp! “2. After sending the message, you will go to the next step where you will be able to process your documentation.” A further analysis using Scam Doc,  a web tool that evaluates the reliability of “digital identities” (email addresses or websites) showed that the website has a 1% trust score. Scam Doc added that: “The domain name is very recent (less than 6 months). The owner of the domain name is hidden: check privacy policies! The creation of the domain name is rather recent. Short life expectancy domain. This domain name is linked to one or more countries known for being used by fraudulent websites.” Dubawa, thereafter, contacted Rhoda Iliya, the Deputy Director, Information in the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development which supervises the N-Power programme to ascertain the truthfulness or otherwise of the information. This is “fake news, please,” she said in a text message to this reporter.

Claim: A Twitter user claims ₦380 billion was earmarked in the 2021 Budget Proposal for the prosecution of Boko Haram suspects.,"On Thursday, November 12, a Twitter user named Adeyinka Oluwadamilare (@aomadrey), claimed that ₦380 billion was earmarked in the 2021 budget proposal for the prosecution of Boko Haram suspects. Oluwadamilare shared a picture indicating that he got the information from TVC News, a private television station in Lagos. The picture has a caption that reads: “Budget Defence: N380 billion projection for prosecution of Boko Haram suspects”. Without citing any other sources, the Twitter user went ahead to make two other major claims, as he attempts to subtly argue the absurdity of budgeting such a huge amount of money for prosecution. He also claimed that the federal government gave the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) ₦20 billion to revitalize public universities. Lastly, Oluwadamilare alleged that while the federal government controls the crude oil in the south-south, it allows Zamfara State to control its gold deposits, thereby implying an unfair treatment. “N380 billion earmarked in the 2021 Budget for the prosecution of Boko Haram suspects. We gave ASUU N20billion to revitalize 90 public universities in Nigeria. Psychological test on our ruling elites is key  On Thursday, October 8, President Muhammadu Buhari presented the 2021 Budget Proposal to a joint session of the National Assembly.

According to the budget proposal, a sum of N20,277,824,795 (₦20 billion) was allocated to the Ministry of Justice for recurrent (non-debt) expenditure. For capital expenditure, the ministry got N5,747,771,298 (₦5.7 billion). Added together, the total amount allocated to the ministry is N26,025,596,093 (N26 billion). This means that the total amount earmarked for the Ministry of Justice is not even anywhere near ₦380 billion which was alleged to have been earmarked for just one item: prosecution of Boko Haram suspects. Checking the budget’s breakdown, Legit.ng notes some line items that have to do with prosecution.  In one of the items, ₦350 million was allocated for “prosecution of prison inmates and decongestion of correctional centres nationwide.” Others are prosecution of maritime/offshore offences (₦270 million) and prosecution of offenders/improving assets recovery and monitoring process (₦375 million). While none of these items directly specify the prosecution of Boko Haram suspects, a further check by Legit.ng found out that the Ministry of Justice had disclosed the specific amount it earmarked to prosecute Boko Haram suspects while defending the budget before the Senate Committee on Judiciary, Legal and Human Rights Matters. According to a report by Premium Times, the solicitor-general of the federation, Dayo Apata told the Senate committee that the ministry proposed ₦2 billion to cover its legal services for the 2021 fiscal year. The legal services include civil litigation, prison decongestion, trial and prosecution of Boko Haram criminals, administration of the criminal justice system and payment for international legal obligations, Apata disclosed. Out of the ₦2 billion, about ₦350 million was budgeted for the trial and prosecution of Boko Haram suspects, according to the solicitor-general.  Based on this shred of evidence, the claim that ₦380 billion was earmarked in the 2021 Budget Proposal for the prosecution of Boko Haram suspects is false. In 2013, the Nigerian government signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with ASUU to make available N1.3 trillion for the revitalisation of Nigeria’s public universities. It was agreed that the fund would be released in tranches of ₦200 billion in 2013, ₦220 billion 2014, ₦220 billion 2015, ₦220 billion in 2016, ₦220 billion in 2017 and ₦220 billion in 2018. While the ₦200 billion was released in 2013 as agreed, the government has failed to honour the agreement to pay the subsequent tranches which has led to several strike actions by ASUU. In September 2018, the Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning announced that President Muhammadu Buhari had approved ₦20 billion for ASUU to revitalise public universities, a far cry from the ₦220 billion which was supposed to be paid in 2014 and the rest of the years as stipulated in the MoU. This was the only payment the federal government has made since the ₦200 billion paid in 2013, according to ASUU president, Biodun Ogunyemi. Meanwhile, ASUU is currently on another strike asking the government to pay half of one tranche, ₦110 billion, as part of the revitalisation fund, among other issues. The ₦20 billion released in 2018 is probably the one Oluwadamilare, the Twitter user, was referring to in his tweet.  Thus, the claim that the federal government, under the Buhari administration, has only released ₦20 billion to the universities is mostly true. This claim has been recurrent on Twitter for a while. It gained more prominence recently when the Deputy Senate President, Senator Ovie Omo-Agege, kicked against the recent sale of gold bars by Governor Bello Matawalle of Zamfara state to the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). He claimed that the governor has no right to sell the mineral resources that belong to the federal government. “Not too long ago, we saw the Governor of Zamfara State come before the CBN to present a gold bar worth close to about N5 billion. The gold bar was presented for sale to the CBN. Mr. President, our people are beginning to wonder who owns this gold that is being sold to the CBN.” According to the report, the Nigeria Minerals and Mining Act (2007) vests the ownership of all minerals, including gold, in the Federal Government, just as the Deputy Senate President noted. The Act vests control of all properties and minerals in Nigeria in the Federal Government and prohibits unauthorised exploration or exploitation of minerals. Thus, to mine gold in Zamfara or any other part of the country, a licence must be obtained from the Federal Government through the Nigeria Mining Cadastre Office of the Federal Ministry of Mines and Steel Development, the report further explained. However, contrary to Mr Omo-Agege’s claim, what Governor Matawalle did was partner with some investors to mine gold in the state and sell to the CBN. Simply put, Zamfara does not own the gold but actually purchased it from the licensed operators in the market and sold it to the apex bank. The claim that gold deposits in Zamfara state belong to the state government is false. The gold deposits in Zamfara and other states and the crude oil in the south-south belong to the federal government.

Claim: A report by Daily Post claims ASUU asked students to prepare for resumption next week.,"A report by Daily Post claims the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) asked students to prepare for resumption next week. The report published on Sunday, November 15, 2020, credited this statement to a post by what it described as ASUU’s official Twitter page. “The Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) told students to prepare for resumption next week. ASUU said this on its official Twitter page as the education body expressed hope of an agreement with the federal government.” A keyword search by Dubwa led to different reports by different news platforms and blogs. One report by information Nigeria noted that ASUU has asked Nigerian students to prepare for resumption next week. This report said this was made known on what it described as the official Twitter account of ASUU even though it did not share a link to the Twitter post or a screenshot of the post. A similar report by Observer Times quoted @ASUUNGR__ as its source with a screenshot of the Twitter post.  Another site named My School News published this same report, also quoting the said ASUU Twitter account with a Screenshot of the Twitter post. Although Dubawa has done different checks on claims by ASUU on Twitter and proved them to be false and misleading, Dubawa went ahead to find this Twitter post. Dubawa’s search found this statement was made by @ASUUNGR__.  The Twitter post which was made on Saturday, November 14, 2020, has generated over 12,000 likes, 2100 retweets and 862 quote tweets. While it is worthy of note that ASUU has distanced itself from any Twitter account noting it does not run any Twitter account, Dubawa took a step further to speak with officials from ASUU. First, Dubawa reached out to the ASUU president, Biodun Ogunyemi, but he’s yet to reply to our inquiries. However, in an interview with Business Day over the weekend, Mr Ogunyemi said the union is not calling off it’s strike yet as it is yet to get concrete action from the federal government. “It is totally fake news. Absolute lie. ASUU does not operate any Twitter handle. The operators of the so-called Twitter are impersonators.” Dubawa also reached out to the chairman of ASUU, Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta (FUNAAB), Olusiji Sowande, who denied the Twitter account and described the claim as false and misleading. “ASUU does not have an official Twitter handle. Therefore, the information about resumption is false and misleading.” The claim that ASUU asked students to prepare for resumption next week is false and misleading as ASUU has denied this and disowned the Twitter account that made this claim.

"Claim: The screenshot of a report by PM news claims that ASUU has urged students to acquire new skills, travel, and have fun, implying there is no end to the strike in sight.","The seven-month long strike of the  Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) looks like it will linger longer than it has even though the Minister of State for Education, Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba recently berated ASUU for refusing to call off its strike. The minister said the union has no reason to be on strike because the federal government has met all but one of their demands.  However, the ASUU President, Biodun Ogunyemi, has said the ongoing strike may continue if the government fails to meet its demand for the federal government to jettison the Integrated Pay Roll and Personal Information System (IPPIS).  On Thursday November 12, 2020, a news report by PMNews claimed ASUU has  advised students to make good use of the strike period to retool, travel, and have fun.  A keyword search by Dubawa led to the actual news report by PMNews. The headline of the report was “ASUU urges undergraduates to acquire skills, travel and have fun.” While the headline ascribes this statement to ASUU, the body of the story noted that this statement was made by a parody ASUU account on Twitter. “A parody account of  Academic Staff Union of Universities, ASUU has given undergraduates seven pieces of advice on how to spend their time because of the union’s indefinite strike.” Even though ASUU’s parody twitter account was not linked to the story, Dubawa went ahead to find this parody Twitter account and its post. Dubawa found three Twitter accounts with the name ASUU on Twitter: one is a personal account @funmibucknor who changed the account name to #ASSU, the second is @ASUUNGR  and the third @ASUUNGR_. The second and the third Twitter account claim to be the official account for ASUU. The Twitter account of @ASUUNGR set up in 2014 is older than @ASUUNGR_ which was set up in 2018. A close look at both accounts shows @ASUUNGR_ is a copy of @ASUUNGR with just additional symbols to its name. For example, instead of @ASUUNGR and Official_ASUU, the third account is @ASUUNGR_ and Official__ASUU. But both Twitter accounts have been responsible for false or misleading claims in the past. A check by Dubawa earlier in October has revealed. Going through the content of each account, Dubawa found the statement used in the report on @ASUUNGR_. This implies that @ASUUUNGR_ is the parody account. ASUU has long distanced itself from any Twitter account in a statement earlier in August and also confirmed to Dubawa in a text message that it does not have a twitter account. ASUU’s president, Biodun Ogunyemi, described the operators of these handles as impostors. “No. ASUU does not have a twitter handle. The operators of the twitter handle are impostors.”  The report by PMNews quoting an account identified as a parody account is false and misleading. In addition to this, there is no report of ASUU making this statement by any media platform except PMNews.

Claim: A viral WhatsApp message claims nobody is President-elect in the United State until the safe harbour period (between November 3 and December 8) is over.,"The United State of America’s presidential election which took place last Tuesday, November 3, 2020, has become the centre of discussion as the world continues to pay close attention to events as they unfold. The election between Donald Trump of the Republican Party and Joe Biden of the Democratic Party was a close battle but so far Joe Biden beat incumbent President, Donald Trump, by scoring 273 electoral college votes against Trump’s 214 votes. However, a viral WhatsApp message claims no one is president-elect until “the harbour period” is over. This “harbour period” has been described as the period between November 3 and and December 8 within which elections are held, result counted, votes certified by states, electoral bodies, electoral colleges, and all court cases are resolved. The message went further to say that after this period, on December 14, the President, the Vice President, and electors from all electoral colleges will be elected. Afterward, on December 23, states must send all verified votes and electoral college votes to the president of the Senate who is the current Vice President. Subsequently, on January 3, a new senate and house of representatives are sworn in, after which the president of the new senate takes the votes to the new senate to recount and presents the results to the house on January 6. According to the message, it is on this day that the president is known, after official  swearing in is done on January 20. Anything short of this, the message noted is just entertainment. The United States (U.S) presidential election is a two-step process. The general voters cast their ballots to elect the electors who in turn meet to formally elect the President. In the U.S whose democracy is over 200 years old, there is no central or federal electoral commission that conducts the presidential election. All elections (federal, state, and local) are conducted by each of the 50 states and the capital territory. And this  includes choosing the electors in the Electoral College that elects the president. While Americans took to the polls on November 3, 2020 and voted, they have not really selected the next president of the United States. Technically, the president and vice-president are selected by a group of electors, collectively known as the Electoral College.  In a nutshell, when voters go to the polls, they are voting for the Electoral College, which then elects the president and vice-president. This means winning the democratic popular vote in the U.S does not determine who is president but winning the Electoral College vote. Although the winner is mostly known once the election is over, members of the Electoral College, however, statutorily meet on December 14 to ratify the election of the winner. The Electoral College is made up of temporarily selected state representatives known as electors. In total, there are 538 members of the Electoral College, representing the 50 states and the nation’s capital, Washington, District of Columbia (D.C.). The winner of the elections must win at least 270 votes. The constitution of the United States mandates that the number of the electors equals the number of congressional delegations, that is, the total number of senators and house of representatives. A 1961 constitutional amendment further increased the number of electors to include representation from D.C which has no member of congress.  The total number of electors is broken down into: 100 Senators, 435 House of Representatives and 3 electors representing Washington D.C. While each state has exactly two senators, the number of House of Representatives depends on the number of congressional districts which can vary. For example, while states like New York and Florida both have 27 representatives, others like Alaska and Delaware each have one. California has the highest number of representatives with 53 members. This year, the Electoral College will meet on December 14, following the general elections, to cast their ballots for the president and vice-president in the individual states and D.C. Usually, the votes of the electoral college is presumed to be based on the outcome of the general elections and the general rules followed by each state. Individual states determine how members of the Electoral College vote. It is worthy of note that the majority of states follow a winner-takes-all approach, that is, whoever gets the majority votes in the general elections in each state automatically wins all Electoral College votes in that state. Forty-eight states follow this rule while Maine and Nebraska, follow an Electoral College voting system that splits the Electoral College votes between congressional district voter outcome and the state-wide outcome According to article II section 1 of the U.S constitution, each state is responsible for appointing electors who shall meet in their respective states, and vote by ballot for two persons, of whom one at least shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves. They shall subsequently make a list of all the persons voted for, and of the number of votes for each. These votes are signed and certified, and transmitted sealed to the seat of the government of the United State, directed to the President of the Senate.  The President of the Senate shall then in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives, open all the certificates, and the votes shall then be counted. The person having the greatest number of votes shall be the President, if such number be a majority of the whole number of electors appointed. But if there is more than one who has such a majority and an equal number of votes, then the House of Representatives shall immediately choose by ballot one of them for President. But if eventually, no person has a majority, then from the five highest on the list, the said House shall in like manner choose the President. But in choosing the President, the votes shall be taken by States, the representation from each state having one vote. A quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two thirds of the states, and a majority of all the states shall be necessary to a choice. Note that the Congress may determine the time of choosing the electors, and the day on which they shall give their votes. This day shall be the same throughout the United States. Currently, Biden, a former vice president under Barack Obama, passed the 270 electoral vote threshold needed for victory on Saturday November 7, 2020, winning the states of Pennsylvania and Nevada. While Biden has started making plans for office, President Donald Trump is yet to concede defeat on grounds of voting fraud noting he will continue to challenge results in several states. Biden reacting to Trump’s refusal to concede defeat said it is embarrassing.  Despite this win, there are a few things that must happen before a new term begins. This period is described as the transition phase. This phase is the period between the election result and the start of the new presidential term on 20 January. Within this period, the incoming president is to assemble a group called a transition team which prepares to assume power immediately after inauguration. So far Biden has set up his team already. The new term of office begins January 20, 2021, when a ceremony called the inauguration takes place in the capital, Washington DC. A report by the British Broadcasting Corporation/(BBC) highlighted and explained terms that will be frequently used during this period. First is the term President-elect. A candidate who wins the election but is yet to be sworn in as the new president on January 20, is referred to as President-elect. Also, the term Cabinet will be used for the top team at the highest level of government which will be announced by Joe Biden. This team includes heads of all the key departments and agencies. This will, however, require approval from the Senate. The people picked by Mr Biden are interviewed by Senate committees in a hearing known as the confirmation hearing which is followed by a vote to approve or reject.  Another keyword is “Celtic.” As president-elect, Biden gets increased protection from the Secret Service and his codename is Celtic. These names are chosen by the candidate. For Trump it was Mogul and Kamala Harris has reportedly picked Pioneer. The safe harbor period which was referred to in the viral WhatsApp message has been made reference to in different documents regarding the election as the safe harbor deadline. This deadline is December 8,2020. An explainer article by Bloomberg noted this as a period where states have the opportunity to resolve any dispute around votes cast and certify these votes.  The 2020 presidential election timeline by the electoral college also discussed this, noting it is a deadline set for states to resolve anything around vote contestation after which the governor of that state is to send a certificate describing how the determination was made to the Archivist as soon as practicable. The term president-elect is used to refer to a candidate who has met the requirements of winning an election. For decades, this term has been used by the media to describe the presidential candidate with the most electoral votes.  A report by Aljazeera described Joe Biden as president-elect having passed the 270 vote electoral college threshold needed to claim victory in the 2020 presidential election. However, this unofficial term is generating controversy in this year’s election. NBC12 in it’s report noted it had received complaints about calling Joe Biden President-elect. The Phrase, president-elect appears in the 20th Amendment, ratified in 1933. It is used there to allow the vice president-elect to become president if a President-elect dies before taking the oath of office. According to the Executive Director of UVA Center for Politics, Larry Sabato, the term president-elect is not new. “The difference is they liked the result in 2016 and they don’t like the result in 2020. In the old days, you didn’t have a president-elect until the Electoral College met; that’s when the title becomes official” The Chairman of the Republican Party of Virginia, Rich Anderson, said the use of the term is no big deal to him but to be technically precise, nobody has the title of ‘president-elect’. “Until an Electoral College winner has been determined there are a lot of moving pieces and a lot of unknowns, which is what we’re seeing play out now”. The U.S Constitution only speaks on the availability of the person who has won the presidential election to take the oath of office. There is no indication when that person actually becomes president-elect. The General Services Administration is tasked with formally recognising the president-elect and providing the funds and access to federal agencies that his team needs. It is true there is a safe harbour deadline of December 8 in the U.S. presidential election as noted by the electoral college election timeline and other reports. The term president-elect is, however, an unofficial term used to describe a candidate who has won the majority of electoral votes. Although it is not found in the U.S Constitution, it is in the 20th Amendment, ratified in 1933.

"CLAIM: Garba Shehu, the Senior Special Assistant for Media and Publicity to President Muhammadu Buhari claimed  on twitter that fuel was sold at N600 per litre on Easter Sunday in 2013.","The recent hike in fuel prices got a lot of Nigerians airing different opinions, with many holding the view that the hike in price is too sudden. Amidst this, the Spokesperson to President Muhammadu Buhari, Garba Shehu,  on September 8, 2020 posted a picture of Punch Newspapers, tagging it with the claim that fuel was sold for N600 on Easter Day in the year 2013, a period when opposition People’s Democratic Party (PDP) was in power. Garba Shehu’s tweet reads: “Don’t allow the PDP to deceive you. Amidst acute shortages, they sold petrol for N600 on Easter Sunday. (See Punch published on that day)” As of September 8, the post garnered over 3,000 comments, over 2,000 persons retweeted while over 3,000 persons liked the post. While some of the respondents disagreed with the claim, others believed and supported the claim. A twitter user identified as PDP2023, with the handle @AtikuZo responded to Shehu’s tweet; “There was never a time in history where the official pump price of fuel was N600, don’t be deceived by APC fraudsters in govt”. Another respondent on twitter, Asad with the handle @Asad_Mukty responded, “Agreed, how much is bag of rice back then? The foreign rice not the local”. We reached out to Garba Shehu on the telephone to confirm if he was referring to the official price or the black market price, but his line was not reachable. Dubawa sent him a text message on the same issue which he replied. His words, “The Punch Newspaper published the cost of fuel on Easter holiday season. I attached a bromide copy of the paper along with my post. Please check the paper”. The Punch publication was not found after a thorough surf of the internet, but Dubawa traced a re-published version of same article to Pan African News Wire Pan African News Wire had republished it on May 25, 2015 and not on Easter Day in 2013. It became much clearer and more convincing that the report published by Pan African News was the same with that of Punch; the same pictures were used and Pan African Newswire, an international medium, also requested readers to contact Punch editor for further clarification. A closer look at the picture posted by Garba Shehu shows that the report was done in Monday May 25, 2015 and not 2013 Easter Sunday as claimed. An excerpt of publication: “Our correspondents reported on Sunday that petrol had dried up in almost all the filling stations nationwide, while black marketers capitalised on the prevailing scarcity by selling the product in jerry cans for between N200 and N600 per litre in places like Lagos, Ogun, Osun, Kaduna and Oyo states, as well as the Federal Capital Territory” By this, Punch predicated its 2013 headline on the strength of findings by its reporters. However, There was no information as to the locations where fuel was sold at the maximum price quoted and now being referenced by Mr Shehu. Dubawa went further to research on the prevailing black market prices of fuel in 2013 but the exercise yielded no result as there is no repository of such data.  A BBC publication on a detailed breakdown of prices from June 2000 to May 2020 did not reflect that fuel was ever sold for N600 per litre anytime during Goodluck Jonathan’s administration as claimed by Garba Shehu. Also, a  research published in 2018 tagged “Oil Subsidy Management and Performance of the Nigerian Economy” shows the hike of fuel prices in Nigeria from 1978 to 2016.  Table-1 of the research reveals that from the year 2011-2015 during the former late President , Umaru Yar’adua and Goodluck Jonathan’s administration, fuel was sold at between N65 and N145.  However, from 1978 during the Olusegun Obasanjo military regime to Jonathan’s administration in 2015, official fuel pump price was never N600. The official fuel pump prices ranged between 5kobo and N145 from the year 1978-2015. We reached out to the President of Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria, IPMAN, Sanu Abdu Fari. Mr Fari told Dubawa there has never been a time in Nigeria when the official price of PMS was sold at N600 per litre. “Such prices (high prices) are sometimes sold at the black market but never a time was the official fuel price per litre sold for N600 in Nigeria”, Sanu said in shock. With all the facts gathered on previous administrations, there is no evidence to back Garba Shehu’s claim that fuel was ever sold at N600.

"Claim:   Some social media users are circulating a video of Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, wherein he purportedly accused operatives of the Special Anti Robbery Squad (SARS) of perpetrating  crime in Nigeria,  thereby suggesting the Governor’s support for the nationwide #EndSARS protest.","Following cases of brutality by men of the Special Anti Robbery Squad (SARS), thousands of Nigerians nationwide and in the diaspora have been staging protests in the past few days. Following the protest, the Inspector General of Police on Sunday announced the disbandment of the police unit but protesters did not back down. They asked for a reform of the entire police force, justice for the victims of brutality, an executive order to the effect of the proscription among others. In the midst of the protest, Nigerian politicians and celebrities have also shown solidarity and support to the agitation. One of such videos is that of Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, condemning SARS activities in the state. However, the authors of the videos claimed the Governor is in support of  the ongoing Nationwide #EndSARS protest. Gov. Wike’s statement in the edited video; “On monday at Orazi, which is my community. Some people went at night to kidnap somebody in their house  and took him to the ATM to withdraw money, the men were wearing SARS uniforms. Today, i’m not acting for the authorities to take action but am letting the world know that the insecurity in Rivers State is perpetrated by the SARS commander.” On October 9, a twitter user with the  name GP and handle @GPda4you, posted the video with a caption that Governor Wike was in support of #EndSARS. The video was viewed by over 7, 900 persons, had 20 comments and 862 retweets.  @GPda4you words; “Governor Wike’s take On SARS MATTERS.. Retweet and Make this Go Viral @PoliceNG should see this As well!! #BuhariResign #EndSARS #EndSarsNow #EndSarsProtests #EndPoliceBrutality #EndSARSImmediately #EndNorthBanditry #EndSARSBrutality iwobi shock iheanacho #NGAALG” Another twitter user, identified as Uncle Goody Goody with the handle, @gluck_azunwena also posted the video on October 9 saying, “Governor Wike on SARS criminal activities in Rivers State. #EndSARS #EndSarsNow #EndSarsProtests #EndSARSImmediately #BuhariResign” Similarly, a Youtube user identified as Chizzy TV posted an edited version of Gov. Wike’s statement about SARS performance in the 2015 election, claiming that “Wike statement is another confirmation that SARS is Northern Agenda. SARS is a Northern rigging and killing machine, that is why their atrocities are being carried only in southern Nigerian” and the hashtag EndSARS was used. Dubawa used Google search engine to track the edited video. Google took us to the full video on the Governor’s official facebook page. The video was first posted on September 13, 2017. In the original video, Governor Wike accused Akin Fakorede, the then SARS commander in Rivers State as the perpetrator but the circulating edited video left out this part. This appears as an intentional act to convince the public that Governor Wike was attributing the statement to the current EndSARS protest. Also, the full video captured the then Rivers SARS commander, Akin Fakorede harassing voters in the Rivers re-run elections in 2016. Governor Wike on October 12, released a statement banning any form of protest on ENDSARS as the President had already scrapped the unit. Rivers residents had planned to join Nigerians in other states on Tuesday 13  October to protest against the harassment and killings of Nigerians by SARS. Although, despite banning protest, Gov. Wike however addressed the protesters, saying, “when SARS was killing my people and I have been shouting no one wants to hear me, now that they are killing their people, they want me to talk, no I won’t talk.” The circulated video of Governor Wike accusing SARS is an old edited video first posted in September 2017. Therefore, it should not be considered as evidence of Wike’s support to the recent #EndSARS protest. This fact-check is produced under the auspices of the Dubawa 2020 Fellowship IN partnership with TODAY95.1FM, Port Harcourt  and NEWSWIRE, NGR to facilitate the ethos of “truth” in journalism and enhance media literacy in the country.

Claim: Several social media users uploaded a picture of a congested crowd apparently taken in Nigeria claiming it to be a picture of Nigerians protesting against police brutality.,"Claim: Several social media users uploaded a picture of a congested crowd apparently taken in Nigeria claiming it to be a picture of Nigerians protesting against police brutality.  The picture has got thousands of reactions on Twitter after it was uploaded by Aubrey Hruby, an American based Africa Investment Advisor, claiming the picture shows young and ambitious African #EndSARS protesters who want to be heard.  The picture of a crowd circulating on social media to depict the number of #EndSARS protesters in Nigeria is an old one that has been circulating on the internet since 2012.  The picture was uploaded by a Twitter user Aubrey Hruby who claimed in a tweet that the picture shows what Africa looks like with young, ambitious men and women wanting to be heard.  “This is what Africa looks like. Young, ambitious & wanting to be heard. #EndSARS  movement in Nigeria reminds us of a quote by Thomas Jefferson, “What country can preserve its liberties if their rulers are not warned from time to time that their people preserve the spirit of resistance?” The picture was also uploaded by U.S-based Nigerian journalist, Farooq Kperogi, on his blog as a cover picture to his article, titled “#EndSWAT/#EndSARS Youth Steamroller and Theory of Rational Ignorance”  Using reverse image search, the picture was found to be an old picture taken in Nigeria and used repeatedly by various newspapers to depict a large number of people in Nigeria.  The picture shows people who gathered during a protest against the scrapping of oil subsidy at Gani Fawehinmi Park, Ojota in Lagos on January 12, 2012. In 2018, Premium Times used the picture as an illustration to the story on the number of people who might start 2019 in extreme poverty, according to the United Nations Commission for Africa (UNECA).  In 2017, the same picture was used to illustrate the population of Lagos State as one of the most populous cities in the world with 24.2 million people, according to the Business a.m, an online platform.  The picture was also used severally by many platforms in 2019 to depict the population boom in Nigeria.  The picture of a crowd circulating on social media to depict the number of #EndSARS protesters in Nigeria is an old one that has been circulating on the internet since 2012.

Claim: A video shared widely on WhatsApp and uploaded to Twitter shows women protesting and calling in Hausa language on Buhari to release “Mallam.”,"Claim: A video shared widely on WhatsApp and uploaded to Twitter shows women protesting and calling in Hausa language on Buhari to release “Mallam.”  “Kai Buhari, Fir’aunan zamani sako mana Mallam,” is a chant in Hausa which literally means “You, Buhari, a modern pharaoh, release Mallam for us.”  The video was edited and recirculated on social media, majorly Twitter and WhatsApp, with the caption “Katsina Women Protesting for Buhari Resignation”.  Verification conducted on the video has revealed that the video shows women members of the Islamic Movement of Nigeria (IMN) calling President Muhammadu Buhari to release Sheikh Ibrahim Zakzaky.  The video was recorded in Abuja and does not show Katsina women calling President Buhari to resign.  The one minute and thirty seconds video was shared widely on WhatsApp and uploaded to Twitter.  A Twitter user with the name Harri (@harri25_) uploaded the video on Twitter, claiming “Kastina Women protesting for Buhari Resignation…#EndSARS”.  The video got more than 55,000 views and about 10,000 reactions in less than 24 hours.  A user with the name Political_Somebody (@princessphilem1) replied to the tweet, “People are obviously tired of his bad government, things are going worse by the day.” Another user with the name Auchman (@Auchman1) added, “And instead of the VP after seeing all these to tell Mr President the truth and resign he is there telling us nonsense” A journalist, Mahdi Garba, who reports on the activities of IMN, said the video was recorded in Abuja when Shi’a Women were protesting for the release of Sheikh Ibrahim El-Zakzaky who was detained by the Federal Government of Nigeria under Muhammadu Buhari.  We could not identify when the video was first uploaded to the Internet, but the content of the video does not show women from Katsina or any particular state in northern Nigeria.  Some women, speaking in Hausa, in the video did not ask Buhari to resign but requested that he release El-Zakzaky.  “Kai Buhari, Fir’aunan zamani sako mana Mallam,” they said. This translates to, “You Buhari, a modern pharaoh (tyrant), release Mallam for us.”  The video being circulated on social media did not show Katsina women protesting for President Buhari’s resignation.  The video was taken in Abuja and shows women members of the IMN calling President Muhammadu Buhari to release their leader who is still under detention for about four years.

CLAIM: That the federal government is giving out 3million grants to support Nigerians.,"A viral ‘forwarded-as-received’ post has been spreading across WhatsApp platforms, with the accompanying claim that the federal government is giving out grants to support Nigerians. The post with a registration link attached to it advanced that the 3 million grant only has 9540 slots available for grab by Nigerians on a first-come, first serve basis. Although the post did not specify the kind of grant it is, The ICIR visited the website through the acclaimed registration link to confirm the veracity of the claim.  The first red flag sighted by this reporter was how the ‘Bitly’ shortened link changed to “bonanzaoffers.xyz”.  After gaining access to the page, another message popped up, congratulating the reporter for visiting the page and standing a chance to “benefit from the 75 billion federal government grant”.  The website went further by asking questions on why a visitor would want to apply for the grant; the amount the visitor would like to apply for; and how a visitor knows about the scheme. These questions are accompanied by varying options. The ICIR ticked ‘start a new business’ and a verification process which took only four seconds emerged. Having been verified, another message popped up, congratulating the reporter for being “successfully shortlisted” to have access to the grant. But for the grant to be disbursed, the website asked the reporter to share the claim to twelve WhatsApp groups or friends. This, according to the pop-up message, is to enable other Nigerians to benefit from the scheme.  However, The ICIR conducted a google search using keywords like “75 billion federal government grants” to ascertain the federal government grants initiative.  It turned out to be a post-COVID-19 stimulus package for Micros, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) termed “ MSME survival fund.” The scheme is a product of the Economic Sustainability Committee Plan aimed at developing a plan to respond to the challenges posed by the economic shock of the Coronavirus pandemic. The grant which is scheduled to run for an initial period of three months, starting from September 2020, is handled by the federal ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment. It targets 1.7 million entities and individuals across the country, of which 45 percent of the beneficiary would be female-owned enterprises, 5 per cent for businesses owned by people living with disabilities. Another federal government’s package of 75billion found by The ICIR during the search was the Nigerian Youth Investment Fund (NYIF) under the auspices of the Federal Ministry of Youth and Sports Development. The initiative which is funded by the central bank of Nigeria will spread over three years to cater to youth-owned businesses and investment needs. However, the fund is a loan package with an interest rate of 5% per annum and a tenor of 5 years with a moratorium of up to 12 months. The announcement added that an individual or non-registered business could draw up to 250,000 Naira while youth-owned registered businesses could apply for up to 3 Million Naira. This is the arrangement the phoney website cloned when it asked for the amount an individual would like to apply for within the  range from #200,000 to 3 million. The ICIR queried the existence of the hoax website through Whois.net to check the website domain information.  As at the time of filing this report, all forms of information always attached to any website is not available for this website in question.  However, while this check can not explicitly state who and where the website was registered, investigation shows the website was created on 08-05-2020 and scheduled to expire a year after.  Other information about the registrant of the website, such as the phone number and email are also not available. All these show the dubious intention by the unidentified owner(s) of the hoax website. Based on the above findings, the website is not only Fictitious but also designed to spread False Information.

"Claim: Several news websites including ThewillNigeria, Naijadiary reported that Desmond Elliot called for the regulation of social media in Nigeria following the #EndSARS protest.","The aftermath of the #EndSARS protest came with an influx of controversies, multiple streams of information, and claims. One of these is a speech by Nigerian actor and politician, Desmond Elliot. Mr Elliot, who is representing the Surulere constituency at the Lagos House of Assembly, was a Nollywood actor who later joined politics as a state lawmaker. At the Lagos State House of Assembly on Wednesday, 26th October 2020, the lawmaker pushed for his fellow lawmakers to pay more attention to the social media. He was reacting to activities of social media users and other citizens following some downside of the #EndSARS protests. Tagged business of the day, the lawmakers were discussing the ‘effects and aftermath of #EndSARS protest in Lagos; destruction of monuments, public and private properties.’ Mr. Elliot’s speech centred around activities of social media influencers and other users was met with rife criticism by Nigerians who rebuked him for referring to users as ‘children’ and calling for regulation. Some sections of the media reported Mr. Elliot’s speech in this sense. For instance,  thewillnigeria.com, a news website, claimed Demond Elliot, called for the regulation of social media in Nigeria in line with the impact it had on the #EndSARS protest. The claim was presented in a news report that was headlined “Regulate Social Media- Desmond Eliot” alongside transcribed statements from Mr. Desmond’s speech.  Naijadiary came up with a similar headline with the lead, “A video captured the moment Nollywood actor turned politician, Desmond Elliot, called for social media regulation at the Lagos State House of Assembly.” Nigerian social media also processed and reacted to the speech in a like manner. Alex Weenick (@Alexweenick ) tweeted in reaction, “Dear Desmond Elliot, If you want to shut down social media like China, Also suggest that death penalty should be included for corrupt politicians like China is doing. #EndOppression #Endbadgovernance #EndSARS”  Another user @Oluchristy implied that the lawmaker even said. “There Will Be No Nigeria In Five Years If We Don’t Stop Social Media” ~ Desmond Elliot.” Like the news headlines, tweets, comments and other posts on social media perceived Mr Elliot’s speech as a call for the regulation of social media in Nigeria. Dubawa sets out to find out if Mr. Elliot actually made this call. DUBAWA traced the original video clip that captures the plenary session of the Lagos Assembly. A content analysis of Mr. Desmond’s speech during the plenary session revealed that he mentioned ‘social media’ twice in his  6 minutes speech.  First when he said that “We need to address certain things: Nigerian youth; the social media; the social influencers. All of these are making the narrative that we’re seeing today. Except we’re joking with ourselves, social media, yes though good has its negative impacts.”  And when he also said, “Please celebrities; please social media influencers, stop the hatred already. You have a means constitutionally to change the government; it’s called your PVC.”  DUBUWA could not trace anywhere within the speech where Mr. Elliot said something about ‘social media regulation in Nigeria’.   Furthermore,  thewillnigeria.com, seems to have doctored Mr. Desmond’s speech to suit its headline: “Regulate Social Media- Desmond Elliot.” In one instance, keywords from his statements were excluded in the reports.  Picture 2: Screenshot of thewillnigeria.com reports on Mr. Desmond  Although the highlighted statement is quoted as Mr. Desmond’s words, his actual statement transcribed from the audio is different. The actual statement from Mr. Desmond’s speech, contrary to the highlights in red, as poised by thewillingnigeria.com was “Except we’re joking with ourselves, social media, yes though good has its negative impacts.”   while ThewillNigeria quoted him as saying “Except we’re joking with ourselves, social media, has its negative impacts.” omitting the phrase “yes though good.”  In his widely referenced speech, Mr. Desmond never categorically called for regulation of social media in Nigeria.  The reports and concurring social media comments are misleading.   ",Nigeria,02/11/2020,https://dubawa.org/endsars-desmond-elliot-never-called-for-social-media-regulation-as-widely-claimed/
"Claim: A viral WhatsApp message gave a breakdown of the new teacher’s salary structure approved by President Muhammadu Buhari, comparing it with that of the police.","Claim: A viral WhatsApp message gave a breakdown of the new teacher’s salary structure approved by President Muhammadu Buhari, comparing it with that of the police. Misleading. While it is true that a new salary structure was approved by the president, details of this structure are still unknown as the process is still underway. As the world celebrated Teacher’s Day on October 5, 2020, Nigeria marked this year’s Teacher’s Day with the approval of a new salary structure and service/retirement year for teachers.  Alongside other beneficial announcements, President Buhari approved a special salary scale for teachers. This move, the government believes, would motivate Nigerian teachers to do better. Following the announcement, a viral WhatsApp message claims that President Buhari approved this new salary structure to equal that of the police. “New Teacher’s Salary Structure Gl 07= Assistant Education Officer (AEO) – N198,000 Gl 08= Education Officer (EO) – N254,000 Gl 09= Senior Education Officer (SEO) II – N271,000 Gl 10= Senior Education Officer (SEO) I – N296,000 Gl 12= Principal Education Officer (PEO) – N321,000 Gl 13= Assistant Chief Education Officer (PEO) – N342,000 Gl 14= Chief Education Officer (CEO) – N419,000 Gl 15= Assistant Director Education (ADE) – N483,000 Gl 16= Deputy Director Education (DDE) – N531,000 Gl 17= Director Education (DE) – N1.5million.” Excerpt of viral WhatsApp message on the new salary structure. A keyword search produced news reports on the approval of a new salary scale for teachers. A report by Daily Trust published on October 6, 2020, noted that the president had approved a new salary scale for teachers while increasing their retirement age to 65 with immediate effect. According to the report, this was made known by the minister of education who represented the president at the 2020 World Teachers Day celebration. Similarly, a report by British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) pidgin on October 5, 2020, also noted that as part of World Teacher’s Day, the president has given approval for special salary for teachers and increased the number of their year of service. Another report by the Guardian published on October 7,2020, described this new salary structure as  “Teacher’s Special Salary (TSS).” It also noted that this new special salary is unclear and the Federal Government may face tough funding options when it is ready to implement the new policy. Recently on Monday, October 26, 2020, the Punch newspaper published an editorial warning of an impending crisis which the new salary scale might foment. The editorial described this new salary scale as an ill-advised move that should be nipped in the bud. This editorial brought to light the fact that education is on the Concurrent Legislative List of the 1999 Constitution, which requires multi-stakeholder buy-in and wide consultation among the three tiers of government but noted this was ignored by the Federal Government.  Dubawa also contacted the spokesperson for the Ministry of Education, Ben Goong, who inferred that there is no breakdown of the new structure as the process is still underway while awaiting committees to work on details of the policy. “There is quite a lot of work to be done, not just the figures, the naira and kobo of salary. What confirmation do you expect from me when I said there is a committee that has not even been inaugurated yet so work on that,” he said. While it is true that the president approved a new salary structure for teachers, details of this new structure, or a breakdown of this salary structure, has not been released. This makes the viral WhatsApp message misleading. ",underway,31/10/2020,https://dubawa.org/misleading-whatsapp-message-gives-breakdown-of-approved-new-teachers-salary-structure/
"Claim: Overwhelming evidence aside, the Nigerian Army denies any role in the Lekki toll gate shootings on Tuesday, tagging all the reports as fake news and video/photo images as ‘photoshop.’","The #EndSARS protest in Nigeria marked its twelfth day on Tuesday, October 20, amidst reports of chaos and attacks by hoodlums that were affiliated to the protesters by the security.  These eventualities led the Lagos State Government to declare a 24-hour curfew; however, this did not deter protesters from converging to protest in the evening hours of the what was to be the first day of the curfew, as the Lekki toll Gate was soon packed with peaceful protesters who defied the curfew to stress their point_#EndSARS.  On this same evening, however, events turned out tragic for the protesters, when some men, kitted in the Nigerian Army gear, opened fire on them, allegedly killing several of the protesters.  The incidence soon erupted into conversations and agitations in the Nigerian social media space with the hashtag, #LekkiMassacre. This was followed by release of video footage, pictures, and live Internet broadcast, mostly showcasing the horror and the agony resulting from the unhappy encounters between the protesters and the armed men. Eventually, the evening was churned up with claims and trends on social media condemning what appeared to be an attack on peaceful protesters by the Nigerian Armed Forces.  Even more,  a foremost Nigerian disk joker, popularly referred to as DJ Switch, who has been part of the protest from its onset, shared an Instagram Live broadcast showcasing injured persons, unconscious ones, and the general chaos of the moment. The live broadcast attributed the shootings to the Nigerian Armed forces.  However, regardless of the overwhelming eyewitness report, multiple news broadcasts, and video footage shared by multiple users,  the Nigerian Army labeled the incident as fake news, while dismissing the footage and images on social media as ‘PhotoShop’. The Army disputed reports of their participation in the shooting and denied the allegations that soldiers opened fire at peaceful protesters at the Lekki Toll Gate Still, #EndSARS protesters continued to ridicule the Nigerian Army’s stance on the incident, attracting vast recognition from prominent persons around the world condemning the Lekki shootings and calling for international intervention.   The Governor of Lagos State, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, not disputing the incident at the Lekki Toll Gate, dispelled the lingering shreds of evidence a day after the Lekki shootings, claiming there were no fatalities.  “Three of the injured protesters have been discharged, while some are in the hospital. There is no record of any fatalities.” Despite his earlier claims on the issue, the Governor later the same day tweeted that “Yesterday’s events were no doubt some of the darkest gradients of our history as a State and as a people. As you are perhaps aware, I have been engaging the #EndSARS protesters since Monday 12 and Tuesday 13 October 2020 respectively.” A statement that appears to contradict the first he made. He further explained that “There are no excuses for the unfortunate incident that took place last night, and as the Governor, I apologize for every action & inaction. I would like you to know that I am for you, I am with you, & I understand that indeed you’re not happy with the turn of events last night.”  Switching sides, the Governor later admitted that two persons died due to the incident and confirmed that more than 20 persons were also injured as a result of the Lekki shooting. Concerning the Nigerian Army’s involvement, the Governor clarified that he has no direct control over them but only the President does. Mr. Sanwo-Olu pledged to set up a committee to conduct an investigation in line with the Nigerian Army’s Rule of Engagement over the Lekki toll gate shootings.   “For clarity, it is imperative to explain that no governor controls the rules of engagement of the army. I have nevertheless instructed an investigation into the ordered and the adopted rules of engagement employed by the men of the Nigerian Army deployed to the Lekki Toll Gate.,” the Governor later tweeted, in what appears to be fingers pointing at the Nigerian Army. Irrespective of the Nigerian Army’s standpoint, prominent personalities such as the U.S former Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, and the current one, Mike Pompeo, have both condemned the use of force by Nigeria’s military forces against unarmed protesters at the Lekki Tollgate. Also, multiple videos shared on social media by users correlate with the location and suggest the presence of the Nigerian Army and how they shot at the peaceful protesters. In one of the early footages,  soldiers were seen approaching protesters and shooting.  Media narratives that have suggested soldiers even shot at the scene claimed the guns were pointed up and not directly at protesters, hinting that the shots were to scare off protesters. In the sequence of events, more videos emerged depicting injured protesters, some unconscious, others gasping for help while being carted away by fellow protesters at the Lekki toll gate. In the sequence of events, more videos emerged depicting injured protesters, some unconscious, others gasping for help while being carted away by fellow protesters at the Lekki toll gate.  In subsequent videos, the Lekki tollgate was visibly ablaze.   Several prominent media outlets like Ajazeera, CNN, BCC, AriseTv, etc, reported on the Lekki shooting, all referencing the conduct of the Nigerian Army. Even though President Muhammadu Buhari eventually said nothing about the Lekki shootings in his speech and remains mute concerning the issue, Amnesty International confirmed it was in possession of  crucial evidence pertaining to the Lekki shootings; affirming that they’ve confirmed at least 12 killings of protesters with 10 directly related to the Lekki toll gate shootings.  Since the onset of the protest, the Lekki toll gate has served as a convergence point for the #EndSARS protesters. Located in the middle-class area of Lagos metropolis, the toll gate has an open space where cars usually assemble. Several events like candlelight remembrance for the victims of police brutality, music concerts, and even performances by popular celebrities were held by the protesters at the venue. Protesters erected tents, made shelters, provided food, cleaned the environment, and organized testimonial sessions at the Lekki toll gate.  It was in this atmosphere of usual serenity and stability, that the protesters, caught between the singing of the national anthem, were alleged to have been shot at by the Nigerian Army. Several claims on social media affirmed the killing to have been premeditated by the Government.  Hours before the incident, a Twitter user @Da_Rapstaman shared what appeared to be an early warning. The tweet notified that “Guys please I don’t know how to verify these men, dem just come the lekki toll gate and cut off the security cameras. Saying they are from the government, hmm.” The men in the photo, who were alleged to be government staff, are confirmed to be a staff of the Lekki Concession Company (LCC), saddled with the supervision of the toll gate on the city’s behalf.   These images were confirmed to have been taken the same day the incident occurred. Social media users circulated the photo, referring to the disposal of the cameras as part of the Nigerian Government’s plan to carry out evil against the Lekki protesters.  According to Amnesty International, the shootings were carried out by the Nigerian Army at around 6:45 Local time. DUBAWA traced multiple videos on social media that depicted the Lekki shootings and the Nigerian Army’s involvement at exactly the same time.   One of the videos earlier shared showed the military approaching the tollgate in their vans towards where the protesters assembled.    The video was wild with sounds of gunshots as the army approached the toll gate. Eyewitnesses say the road has been deserted after protesters took hold of the tollgate. So when the incoming military convoy approached the Lekki toll gate, protesters easily took notice of it.  Another video verified by Dubawa shows protesters telling each other to sit down as soldiers approached. Just immediately, the protesters were heard saying ‘we are not leaving,’  announcing that ‘soldiers have started shooting.’  Soon after, the footage came to an abrupt end. The video footage was confirmed by DUBAWA to have been covered at Lekki toll gate at exactly the alleged time of the incident; 6:45 PM local time. One scene in the video shows protesters seated down at the Lekki toll gate with shreds of voices in the background alerting protesters that the Army is approaching,  imploring the protesters to sit down. Soon afterward, another video showed soldiers shooting at protesters at the Lekki toll gate. The analysis of the footage shows members of the Nigerian Army in their full military gear firing gunshots at the protesters before them. DUBAWA analyzed the video on the InVid video verification tool and results show the video to have appeared over a thousand times on Twitter alone at almost the exact time, while no copy was identified to have appeared later than Tuesday, 10th October 2020 at 6:45 PM. The video was void of any doctoring and taken with a mobile device. An analysis of some clips from the video shows members of the Nigerian Army actively engaged with the protesters at the Lekki toll gate and later began firing gunshots at the protesters.

Image 3: depicting a Nigerian army officer with what appears to be like the Nigerian Army shoulder pad; red black red.  Another video confirmed by DUBAWA shows Soldiers on standby at the Lekki toll gate,  while protesters cart away  what  appears to be bleeding corpses of protesters. The video which was analyzed on InVid was neither doctored nor edited, taken with a mobile device at around 7:15 PM local time, the same day and around the time of the  Lekki toll gate shootings. In the background, protesters could be heard yelling “how many people soldiers want to kill today?”   Image 4: depicts protesters carry an apparently injured or dead protester to another location with soldiers on sight. Though the Nigerian Army has denied all allegations of the Lekki toll gate, shreds of open-source evidence suggests the contrary. With regards to the protest, there are other instances where the narrative of the army appears to shift. On one instance, when one Nigerian soldier behind a mask said on social media about #EndSARS that “the fight civilians are fighting is our fight,” the Nigerian army quickly tagged him as a ‘fake soldier.’  However, just 24 hours later the Nigerian Army came out to say that the hooded soldier whom they tagged ‘fake soldier’ has been ‘identified’ as Lance Corporal Harrison Friday of the Nigeria Army.  After the Lekki shootings, most hospitals reported having treated or are still treating injured patients from the shootings. Individuals last seen at the protest ground at Lekki toll gate were reported missing. A call-out by a user on Twitter to report missing persons from the shootings saw several reports on missing persons.    A user on Twitter recently shared a video of a corpse he found around the Lekki toll gate, two days after the shootings. The author of the tweet claimed that the corpse was around the scene of the Lekki toll gate shootings. As the video pans, the author presents the dead body that seemed to have been lying there for days bleeding from injury.  There are several reports of missing persons, and though there are no sufficient facts to prove so, several eyewitnesses have claimed that the military took with them the dead bodies from the Lekki gate shooting. Most of these missing persons are attributed to the Lekki toll gate event where they were last seen.  Although the army has tagged the Lekki Shootings as ‘fake news’ and has even denied that it has ever occurred, several facts show otherwise. Analyses of several reports, pictures, and video footages show that the Nigerian soldiers were present at the Lekki toll gate and indeed shot at protesters.

Claim: Several people believe that sleeping under a mosquito bed net  treated with insecticide (or not treated) is ineffective and harmful to human health.,"Commenting on an article on ‘Treatment and use of Insecticide-treated Mosquito Nets’ by the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme, some people shared their experiences on the use of treated nets. On September 30, 2019, one of them, Ajith, raised a question on the website, saying: “I want to know how the itching of the net can be removed??? For reuse”.  Also on April 26, 2020, another person, Pradip, reacted to the article with the comment: “when I sleep under it during night, I feel irritation in my face and eyes, what to do.?”  Likewise on May 26, 2020, W. Maynard, another contributor, claimed that sleeping under a treated net caused a burning sensation around the eyes and face and would like to know why?  Another person who joined the conversation on the website, Monica, also reacted on May 27, 2020, noting that: “I have the same problem tingling and burning sensation on the face especially around the eyes.” These are few among many claims about health hazards of Insecticide treated bed nets. Malaria and certain other diseases are transmitted by bites from Anopheles mosquitoes. To prevent this, experts counsel that sleeping under mosquito preventive bed nets reduces both mosquito bite and malaria. However, using ordinary mosquito nets, those not treated, provide limited protection because mosquitoes may still bite through the net after perching on the untreated net, depending on how close the person inside the net is to the net. According to an article written by Brian Mcneill from Virginia Commonwealth University, the nets, which serve as a protective barrier for the people sleeping under them, have been proven to help prevent the spread of malaria, a disease that saw 219 million cases and 435,000 deaths in 2017, according to the World Health Organization. As the name implies, Insecticide Treated Bednets (ITNs) or Long Lasting Insecticide-Treated Nets (LLINs) are treated with insecticide to provide better and effective protection by keeping away mosquitoes, as well as killing them. ITNs and LLINs also kill or keep away other nuisance insects like cockroaches, bedbugs, houseflies, fleas, etc. But there have been reports or claims that the insecticide treated bednet does not work and are harmful to human health. Are these claims true? Or, are there other things we are ignorant of that we really need to know about ITN or LLIN? Mosquito nets, also called bednets, are hung over beds. Some tents are made of mosquito-net fabric to help campers avoid the pesky insects. Light and air can easily penetrate mosquito nets, but mosquitoes cannot; nevertheless, the sharp proboscis of the mosquito, that is, the long, narrow mouthpart the mosquito uses to pierce the skin and suck the blood of its victim can penetrate the net if draped directly on the human body.  The word insecticide is used to describe any chemical that is applied against undesired insects that cause harm to animals, humans, and plants; but all pesticides are toxic in nature. The risk of adverse effects from a pesticide depends on the toxicity of the chemical and the degree to which an organism is exposed to it.  The insecticide used in Insecticide-Treated Nets, ITNs, is deadly to mosquitoes, but generally harmless to people and pets. It slowly breaks down when the material is washed or constantly exposed to sunlight. Some ITNs need to be replaced every six months, while newer versions last up to three years. ITNs that last three years are called Long-Lasting Insecticide-Treated Nets (LLINs). ITNs are one of the most effective methods of preventing mosquito-borne diseases in the developing world, reducing the number of malaria cases by 20%, most of which involve children not yet five years old. ITNs are crucial in the developing world, where lack of money, lack of available medications, and lack of distribution networks can prevent communities from accessing antimalarial drugs. Although, new research indicated that mosquitoes may develop behavioural resistance to insecticide-treated nets (ITNs), ITNs are the most effective tool against malaria in the developing world. According to NOVA Next, “the reductions in transmission are nothing short of astonishing — 25%, 50%, even 80% fewer cases in some places.” LLINs are mosquito nets which have the insecticide embedded in their fibre, so that it is not removed by as many as 20 washes. Because these nets have an even and quality controlled insecticide application, they are generally more effective than conventional ITNs. Also, the LLIN is more cost-effective (as it can be used for three to five years) than conventional bed nets that are treated with insecticide once or twice a year. Conventional ITNs are therefore only a rational option in areas, where the population already has so many nets. In order to prevent and control malaria, there was a global partnership in 1998 by the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), and the World Bank to found Roll Back Malaria (RBM). The goal was to halve the world’s malaria burden by 2010, with the period 2001–2010 tagged as the “United Nations Decade to Roll Back Malaria.” The RBM partnerships include national governments, civil society and nongovernmental organizations, research institutions, international development agencies, and development banks. Also between 2015 and 2017, 624 million insecticide-treated mosquito nets were distributed, mostly for free, to reduce malaria, severe disease and death in regions of the world where malaria is endemic. According to an Associate Professor at the Faculty of Pharmaceutics, Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Dr. Olusola Aremu, the main purpose of the treated bed nets is to protect an individual against the mosquito. He noted that the chemical solution used in treating the ordinary net kills the mosquito once inhaled or serves as a repellent to such mosquito from the odour of the chemical. Speaking on why the treated net is neither harmful nor ineffective, Dr Aremu noted that the chemicals used in treating the net were meant to kill or repel the mosquito. Human beings, also a living organism, can be affected if the instructions on the manual for net users are not adhered to, he said. He added that the essence of drying the net for hours before use is to allow for escape of some of the chemicals to reduce toxicity.  Answering to why some are affected by the net even after all instructions are adhered to, Dr Aremu noted that people’s  genetic makeup differs and what affects ‘Mr A’ at the first instance may not have impact on ‘Mr B’ at several instances; and the drug ‘Mr A’ can take without any complication can adversely affect ‘Mr B’. He advised that people whose genetic makeup cannot tolerate the chemical left on the net after it has been exposed to coolness for over 12 hours, such as those that get itching, irritation, burning sensation around the eyes and face, etc; should use other methods of preventing mosquitoes. Dr Aremu further stated that in advanced medical practice, consultation and drug administration is being individualised, that is, the medication given to ‘Mr A’ might not be given to ‘Mr B’ because his body might not tolerate it; hence, the need to know the genetic makeup of a patient before administering medication is highly recommended.

Cosmas Ayilola, noted that an untreated bed net only serves as a barrier for any mosquito that wants to penetrate into the net while treated ones, aside serving as a barrier, also has the tendency to kill the mosquito lingering too much on the net.  Pharm. Ayilola said the bed net “is harmful to human health and not harmful, depending on the individual and precautions taken. Exposing it in a cool atmosphere, a good ventilated area free from the sun between 12 to 24 hours reduces the harmfulness drastically and will have little or no effect on humans”. He added that the untreated bed net can be tagged inactive when the net is not well tucked in because mosquitoes can still find their ways in. While the treated bed net can be tagged harmful when the necessary precautions are not diligently adhered to. He also noted that an untreated bed net can effectively serve the function of an urgent and immediate use. Talking on why and how a treated bed net can be harmful to human health, Pharm. Ayilola said “those who take it from the nylon and use immediately would be exposed to the chemicals that were used in treating the net which may have a negative effect on their respiratory system and eventually may have its way to their lungs and then to their bloodstream. When a person keeps sleeping under this type of net or gets constantly exposed to such net, the chemical will also find its way inside and the effect of this chemical is cumulative….cumulative in the sense that it will be accumulating in the system, so it might get to a threshold whereby the effect will be significant. So precaution is what makes the difference”. He also advised that “treated bed nets should be obtained from reliable sources so that untreated nets or ITNs are not presented to you as LLITNs”. But how come some are not effective, hazardous and others are effective and not a threat to human health? Pharm. Ayilola noted that what really differentiates these types of nets are the treatment and level of chemicals used. He added that an untreated net has no chemical at all, so it is not a threat to human life but can be tagged ineffective if it touches the human body because a mosquito can bite through it, as there is no chemical to kill or repel the mosquito.  In his response to this, Dr Aremu also noted that the INTs cannot last as much as the LLITNs, adding that, the lasting of the nets also depends on the area it is used and the number of times it is washed. But opined that the untreated bed net is ineffective because the smallest size of mosquito can penetrate through it and feed on the body of its victim. Dr Aremu submitted that whether your net is washed weekly, biweekly, monthly or as you deem fit, the net should be changed at the 20th wash. Anyanwu, E.C., Ehiri, J.E., Kanu, I., and Merrick, J. in an article titled: “Health effects of long-term exposure to insecticide-treated mosquito nets in the control of malaria in endemic regions” noted that, one key strategy that has emerged as a tool for malarial control under the leadership of RBM and its allies is the use of insecticide-treated mosquito nets ITMNs.  As the WHO asserts, “there is no doubt about the effectiveness of ITMNs; the challenge is to scale up their use”. This recommendation is based on field trials on the effectiveness of ITMNs, which demonstrated significant reductions in mortality following their use. However, few people, mainly because of their high cost and the perception that the chemicals used to treat them have dangerous effects on pregnancy and the fetus, use ITNs. In another report, Anyanwu et al. noted that health risks arising from the use of ITMNs primarily include exposure during storage and transport, during net treatment, and during use, exposure to vapors, or dermal or oral contact; adding that evidence showed that all organochlorines, organophosphates, carbamates, pyrethroids, and some fumigants used as insecticides are known neurotoxicants. Feldman, J. in his research noted that people apply pesticides without protective masks and they usually spray or light the insecticide “coils” in their bedrooms before going to sleep;  in such a situation, it would be impossible to avoid direct pesticide inhalation and at least residual neurotoxic response to the chemical insecticide. To investigate the extent of the problem, the U.K. Pesticide Action Network undertook case study evaluations of the safe use of ITMNs in a number of African countries. In Gambia, for example, the group selected permethrin, the insecticide used to treat bed nets in the country’s malaria control program and imported into Gambia by the Government and a number of aid agencies. There were 1300 villages involved in the program and studies have shown that the use of permethrin-impregnated bednets has reduced the number of fatalities from cerebral malaria; however, permethrin is a neuropoison and, as well as acting on the nervous system, can cause itching and burning sensations on exposed human skin.  Also, Field studies revealed significant risks of exposure at a number of stages of the chemical life cycle. These included the time when the pesticide is decanted from the large imported drums, when the bed nets are impregnated by village health workers or by individuals in their own homes, when unlabelled containers are brought into the home, and from misuse of the chemical. A recent study in the U.S. suggests that 80% of most people’s exposure to pesticides occurs indoors and that measurable levels of up to a dozen pesticides have been found in the air inside homes. The amount of insecticides found in homes appears to be greater than can be explained by recent pesticide use in those households., which is certainly a threat to human health. Kakko et al. reported that when whole communities were provided with treated nets, ovarian age grading showed a reduction in mosquito survival rate and in the number of sporozoite-positive mosquitoes in malarious communities. Thus, a high percentage of coverage of all members of malaria-endemic communities is considered the most effective way of providing protection for highly malaria-vulnerable children and pregnant women. They also stated that there was evidence for reduced antimalaria antibody levels in children in communities where treated nets have long been used. However, overall benefits in reduced anemia and mortality are sustained. Curtis et al. conducted a randomized controlled trial to assess the long-term effects of bednet protection during early infancy. A total of 3387 neonates from 41 villages in rural Burkina Faso were individually randomized to receive either bednet protection from birth (group A) or from age 6 months (group B). They then concluded that their study provided additional evidence for the efficacy of ITNs in young children living in areas of intense malaria transmission. But both the aim and outcome of the Curtis et al. research seem to support only the efficacy of the temporal use of bednets, but not the use of IIBNs, and do not tell much about the long-term effects of IIBN exposures. It is important people know that exposure to insecticides without following precautions places them at increased risk of a variety of acute and chronic conditions, including cancer. Also, according to, Anyanwu et al., many of the anticipated behavioural effects caused by insecticide use could be avoided by the use of untreated bed nets, which, according to them, is supported by the evidence from studies on the efficacy of untreated bed nets to which they provided a reasonable degree of protection against malaria.

Claim: Media reports and social media users claimed that Dr. Okonjo-Iweala has emerged as the first female DG of WTO.,"There was a breaking news by an online news website, THE NEW DIPLOMAT, in the early hours of Tuesday, October 27, 2020, that Nigeria’s former Finance Minister and a former Managing Director of the World Bank, Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, has emerged as the  first  female Director-General of the World Trade Organization(WTO)” The online media categorically stated that Dr Okonjo-Iweala has emerged as the first African and the first female to attain the position of Director General of WTO by emerging as the finalist after eliminating South Korea’s current  Trade Minister, Dr Yoo Myung-hee, in a fierce battle for the coveted job on Monday night, October 26, 2020, “It added that the decision among some of the key, and influential Nations within the global power bloc to move in Nigeria’s direction followed very tough, rigorous and high-level negotiations with China reportedly tilting the dynamics.” The New Diplomat, Europe’s outpost office, gathered that with the EU nations and the United States moving in opposite direction, a move that triggered a deadlock between the two powerful geo-political allies for the first time in many years, it was the decisive and quiet support of China that finally tipped the scales in Okonjo-Iweala’s favour. It added that “The WTO’s Ambassador Walker’s led General Council, the overall organ responsible for picking the organization’s next DG, would officially announce the choice of Nigeria’s former Finance Minister, Dr Okonjo-Iweala today, October 27, barring any any unforeseen changes in the organization’s schedule….an official announcement to this effect would be formally made today by New Zealand’s Ambassador Walker’s led WTO General Council.” Latching on this, a former member of the Nigerian Senate, Shehu Sani, congratulated Dr. Okonjo-Iweala on the said appointment through his Twitter handle, @ShehuSani, on Tuesday, October 27, 2020. Senator Sani said “Congratulations to @NOIweala for the @wto job.” The tweet already garnered close to 800 likes and many comments. Aside from the Senator, many people on their Twitter handles had gone to congratulate the Nigerian contestant with so much enthusiasm. Publisher, Dele Momodu Ovation also tweeted, “Breaking news: Okonjo Iweala named DG of WTO. Wow! Excellent choice. Congratulations 🎈🎉🍾🎊 to her and to Nigeria and our great people!!!!!” With so many responses, over 700 retweets and over 3100 likes.” Also on Wednesday, October 28, 2020, TheCable reported that Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala has emerged winner of the highly competitive race, adding that Dr Okonjo-Iweala was chosen as the final candidate for the much-coveted role as she polled 104 votes from 164 member countries to defeat the South Korea’s Trade Minister at the final stage of the race. TheCable also reported that “She has broken many records, including becoming the first African to occupy that office at the WTO.” But noted that “The official announcement is expected to be made by the WTO at 3pm Nigerian time.” The Vanguard also reported on Wednesday, October 28, 2020, that “Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Nigeria’s ex-finance minister and nominee for the office of the director-general of the World Trade Organisation, WTO,  is set to emerge winner in the highly competitive race.” Likewise, The Nation in Nigeria Tweeted:  Earlier in October, Dubawa debunked similar social media and news websites’ posts claiming she had been appointed. World Trade Organisation (WTO) is a permanent international organisation dealing with global rules of trade between nations. It is the successor of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), established in the aftermath of the Second World War. The last 1986-94 Uruguay round led to creation of the WTO in 1995. At the heart of the WTO is a multilateral trading system consisting of WTO agreements negotiated and signed by majority world’s trading Nations and their Parliaments. WTO has about 160 members which account for 95 percent of world trade, and there are 25 other negotiating members. The decisions at WTO are made by the entire membership by consensus and these decisions are ratified in member nations’ parliaments as well. Findings by Dubawa show that the General Council of the WTO in charge of the selection is yet to make a declaration on the appointment. Secondly, although the selection of the WTO Director General is already in the final stage, there are indications that the General Council Chair, David Walker, and his co-facilitators in the DG selection process will, at their meeting today, give their assessment of the candidate most likely to attain a consensus of the members to become the Director-General. But, the world needs to wait for the official declaration which is yet to be announced because the scheduled date for the declaration of the winner is scheduled for between the 27th October and the 6th of November, 2020. Also, theafricareport noted that “Nigeria’s Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala was slated to be the new Director-General of the World Trade Organization. She will be the first woman and the first African, to lead the institution. But there was an unexpected glitch in the process.”  An update from allafricareport earlier posted, stated, “In a last ditch move, the United States representative at World Trade Organization took to the floor to insist that South Korea’s candidate remained a contender, and that Washington will not recognise Okonjo-Iweala as the consensus candidate for appointment as director-general. “In response to this, the General Counsel has postponed its announcement of the new Director-General until a further meeting, which is scheduled for 9 November; after the US presidential elections.” The report added that “Today’s announcement that Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala is to be the new director-general of the World Trade Organization would have been a tremendous boost for Africa and lines her up for one of the toughest jobs in the international system. Our sources in Geneva say that she had won the support from the vast majority of member states, including the EU, Japan and China, but not the United States.” Dubawa sent two electronic mails to the WTO, through its enquiry desk. In response, WTO’s Director of Information and External Relations Division, Keith Rockwell, replied that “there has not yet been a decision.” “There will be a heads of delegation meeting today at 15:00. At this meeting General Council Chair David Walker and his co-facilitators in the DG selection process will give their assessment of the candidate most likely to attain a consensus of the Membership and become the Director-General,” the email further reads. Keith noted that “it is very important to keep in mind that the meeting is for assessment of the Troika and that it is the members who would eventually and formally decide in the General Council who becomes the next DG.” “I expect the General Council will take place in the coming days but don’t yet know when that will be. It’s likely that Amb. Walker will inform the Members on this at today’s meeting,” the email added. She said a news item will be issued and posted on the WTO website shortly after the meeting is concluded, adding that more information on the DG selection process can be found on the WTO website.” After the WTO General Council meeting held on Wednesday, October 28, 2020, the Chair, David Walker, tweeted on the results of the consultations to appoint the next #WTODG.  Summing up the announcement by GC Chair Walker, the WTO spokesperson, Keith Rockwel said: “The candidate that had the best chance of attaining a consensus of the membership is Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala of Nigeria; adding that consultations on the way forward will start immediately.” The race to succeed the Brazilian Robert Azevedo as Director-General of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), has been a keen contest, which started with an array of eminently qualified contestants from across the world and it has reached the decisive stage when the 164 member states of the organisation begin the process of deciding who between the two remaining contestants, Nigeria’s Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala and South Korea’s Yoo Myung Hee, deserves the position. Alhough the race for the coveted job of DG WTO has been fierce with Nigeria’s Okonjo-Iweala and South Korea’s serving Trade Minister, Yoo Myung-hee, and the WTO General Council has disclosed that Dr Okonjo-Iweala has the best chance of attaining a consensus of the membership, the council is yet to officially and publicly declare Dr Okonjo-Iweala as the next DG of WTO.

"CLAIM: That ASUU and federal government meeting ended in an altercation, and ASUU chairman, Prof Biodun Ogunyemi, was slapped.","On 23rd October 2020, a Twitter user @maryamamasa posted a twenty-seven-seconds video clip of a rowdy session, claiming that it was an altercation between the leadership of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) and delegates of the federal government during a meeting to end the ongoing industrial action by the union. The video which was uploaded at exactly 11:17 am has gathered 460 likes, 276 retweets and viewed by 9,928 users She said: “We are not resuming school anytime soon. I think they slapped ASUU chairman, just received a dirty slap.” After some hours, @maryamamasa deleted the video but The ICIR archived the tweet (here)  On March 9, 2020, university lecturers in Nigeria declared a two-week warning strike to protest against what it termed “forceful” enrolment into the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System (IPPIS), a payroll software mandated for all public officials. After the expiration of the warning strike, the union declared an indefinite strike to further press home their demands. This was despite the closure of schools by the federal government to contain the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. The meeting which was held on October 21, 2020, however, ended in a deadlock after the union rejected the offer by the FG team to pay the salary of the lecturers and the 30b earned allowance, using IPPIS pending the roll-out of the union’s preferred payment platform, University Transparency and Accountability Solution (UTAS) To verify the clip, The ICIR conducted an analysis of the video by subjecting its keyframes to multiple reverse image search using Google and TinEye. One of the results led to a youtube video uploaded three years by Sahara Reporter with a caption detailing rancour in the Edo State House of Assembly “Members of the Edo State House of Assembly in Free-For-All fight to replace the speaker,” the caption read. Further checks led The ICIR to another video uploaded by one Kemi Ariyo on Youtube. The five-minute video which was uploaded on August 15, 2017, also gathered 18,409 views.  “Fight in Edo State House of Assembly after the speaker, Dr Justin Okonoboh was impeached. Kabir Adjoto replaced him,” he also captioned. On August 14, 2017, the plenary session on the floor of the Edo State Assembly got tense when the speaker of the House, Dr Justin Okonoboh, was impeached, following an impeachment notice signed by 16, out of the 24-member assembly. His deputy, Mrs Elizabeth Ativie, and the former Majority Leader, Mr Foly Ogedengbe, were also suspended for three months. The house became rowdy when Mr Sylvanus Eruaga, member representing Etsako West II, was said to have asked Okonoboh to vacate the seat, a call that led to a fight among some of the lawmakers in the chambers. After the brawl, a former principal officer of the House, Mr Kabiru Adjoto, representing Akoko Edo I, was elected as the new Speaker. However, according to PUNCH, the last meeting held between the Federal Government and the union was on Wednesday 21st of October 2020 and it ended in a deadlock following the disagreement over the payment platform that would be used in disbursing the salary arrears and the N30bn Earned Allowances of the university lecturers.  Responding to the claim, ASUU president, Prof Biodun Ogunyemi, in a text sent to The ICIR discarded the viral video, stating he has never been slapped in any meeting with the government “That is not true. ASUU President was not slapped at any point in our discussion with the government,” he stated. The claim that ASUU president was slapped during a meeting with the federal government is FALSE. The video was from 2017 during a rowdy session in the Edo State House of Assembly which led to bickering between parties.

"CLAIM: The Queen of the United Kingdom, Her Royal Majesty, Elizabeth II wrote a condolence letter to the Nigerian government over the death of President Muhamadu Buhari.","THREE pictures- claiming evidence of Muhammadu Buhari’s death and that the Queen of Britain, Her Royal Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II, wrote a condolence letter to the Nigerian government over the demise of the president have recently been making rounds on social media and WhatsApp. An attached post to the pictures claimed that the royal majesty wrote the letter on February 7th, 2017, furthering that former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Theresa May, also paid a condolence visit to the Nigerian Ambassador to the UK to register her grief towards the death of the president.  The text inscribed in one of the pictures reads thus: “The Queen of Britain, Her Royal Majesty Queen Elizabeth II has sent a message of condolence to the family of Nigeria’s President Muhammadu Buhari and the people of Nigeria.”  There are no official reports on the speculated death of the President and the message of condolence from the two sources close to the presidency and to Nigeria have said  President Buhari has passed on and that the photos circulating online are those from his previous visit. Another London source says Prime Minister Theresa May has visited the Nigerian Ambassador to the UK. In a message of condolence, the Queen has said the following about Buhari:  “The death of President Buhari came to us as a shock. He has been one of the active pillars in Africa. May the good people of Nigeria and Africa know that our hearts are with them in these hard times.”  In mid-2016, President Muhammadu Buhari left Nigeria in a highly controversial trip to the United kingdom to treat a ‘persistent’ ear infection not less than a year after he won the 2015 presidential election. The trip which was to take 10 days was to enable the President to meet with an “Ear, Nose and Throat” specialist after he was examined by his personal physician and an ENT specialist in Abuja. The medical leave was, however, extended following concerns his health might get worse. An official statement advanced the leave was extended to enable the president to wait for the results of a series of tests that were carried out on him. Mr. Buhari ended up using seven weeks which fuelled anxiety among Nigerians who were spreading speculations about his health. Upon his return to the country, the president told newsmen he had never felt “so sick” as he felt during his stay in London for treatment. The ICIR ran a  check on one of the pictures which the poster claimed was the Queen’s condolence message, using Google reverse image tool to ascertain the time the image first appeared online.  The search which showed seven results in 0.42 seconds revealed that the earliest use of the image found by The ICIR was on November 18, 2018, in a post titled “Buhari’s cousin Mallam Daura attacks Nnamdi Kanu for insisting Jubril is Buhari” on one 9jaflaver.com The blog claimed to have culled the excerpt of the interview from The Sun Newspaper, but The ICIR could not find the interview on the newspaper’s website.  The picture resurfaced on popular microblogging site, Twitter, on 26 November 2019,  in a tweet by one Akanimo Umah @AKANIMOUmoh5. The image which was then reposted by another user on the microblogging site @navimumbaiipob on October 2, 2020, at exactly 12:08 post meridiem, has gathered 414 retweets and 242 likes as of October 20, 2020. The post attached images purported to be of  President Buhari’s death certificate and accused Her Royal Majesty of covering up the claim and conspiracy against the actualisation of the Republic of Biafra, a secessionist state that existed from May 1967 to January 1970 during Nigeria civil war. At the height of the anxiety about the president’s health in 2017, there were speculations of the president’s rumoured death flying across the country. Popular among the speculations was the one pushed by Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB).  By comparing Buhari’s pre- and post-medical leave physique, Nnamdi Kanu advanced that Buhari had died and had been replaced by a lookalike who he called “Jubril” from Sudan.  Since making the claim, several social media users have been reposting that president Buhari is an impostor with varying pictures to question his identity. However, the president while responding to the claim in a town hall in Poland where he attended a United Nations climate conference,  regarded those peddling the false information as “ignorant and irreligious” people. Discussions about the conspiracy rested from online arguments prior to the 2019 elections. But due to the protracted silence of the President over the Lagos Lekki shooting of the armless #EndSARS protesters, Nigerian netizens brought back the argument while many people fell for it.  The ICIR again, conducted a search for media evidence of the Queen’s correspondence with Nigeria between  2017 to 2020. The earliest correspondence found by The ICIR was the letter written by the Queen to felicitate with Nigeria on the occasion of her sixtieth independence anniversary. The letter which was conveyed to the presidency by the British High Commission in the country called for a stronger bond between Nigeria and the United Kingdom. “It gives me great pleasure to offer my warmest congratulations on the 60th anniversary of Nigeria’s Independence, together with my best wishes for your country’s continued happiness and prosperity,” the message read. “The United Kingdom and Nigeria benefit from strong and enduring ties as Commonwealth partners through shared history and most importantly, our people. These are bonds that I hope and believe will flourish long into the future.” she wrote Also, the featured image attached to the claim was used when Her Majesty signed the European Withdrawal Act which gave royal assent to the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union on June 27, 2018. Our investigation also showed that the picture which was copyrighted to Wikimedia (Chatham House) has been used multiple times to illustrate events involving the monarch. The ICIR also subjected the featured image to a metadata tool and it revealed that the picture was taken on 18th November 2014 at exactly 6:17 pm with NIKON D800 (camera) and by Ian Enness, a freelance photographer.  Based on the above findings, the claim that Queen Elizabeth II wrote a condolence letter is baseless and FALSE, just as the returning of the claim that failure of Buhari to address the #EndSARS protests on time does not constitute a sufficient condition to mislead citizens on the same issue that had been resolved since 2018.

"Claim: TVC news as well as other social media users had reported that the Adekunle Police Station in Yaba, Lagos had been set ablaze by angry #EndSars protesters.","On twitter, many users reported and shared news of the Adekunle police station being razed by protesters and the report gained more grounds when local television news station, TVC reported it. The Jonathanian (@The_Jonathaian) tweeted against the burning of the police station, asking whoever is responsible to “Stop this now” reminding people that “the #EndSars is a non-violent peaceful protest to pressurize the government to #EndPoliceBrutalityinNigeria,”  Others like Shaba Baba Muhammad (@Spychief) simply tweeted to “inform” others saying, “Adekunle Police Station in Yaba has been set on fire……. By Peaceful Protesters” But Usman Yusuf (@UsmanYusuf) tweeted with additional misinforming reports, “BREAKING: Adekunle Police Station in Yaba, Lagos on fire after an attack by #EndSars Protesters following another attack on RRS members and building on Herbert Macaulay way with many others injured and vehicles vandalised @ValiantNig!”  TVC News was the most viral as its burning was reported on live national TV with the on screen headline, saying, “Just in: Adekunle Police Station, Yaba on fire” The hashtag #EndSARS campaign and protest kicked off again this year with a lot of Nigerian entertainers, activists, and influencers calling for the disbandment of the Federal Special Anti Robbery Squad unit of the Nigerian Police Force.  SARS has been accused of extra-judicial killings and the most recent being, the shooting of 2 young men in Portharcourt and in Ughelli with the former reported to have died much earlier. Since the protest  started, many unverified stories have filled the social media space on an hourly basis. At 13:00 on Monday, the 19th of October, gunshots from the Adekunle police station were heard by protesters and pedestrians causing a pandemonium in the Yaba area of Lagos. Not long after, reports of the Adekunle Police Station being burnt down followed almost immediately on social media with some Television and online news platforms confirming the report. Dubawa reached out to the PRO of the police command in Lagos State, SP Olumuyiwa Adejobi who tagged the report untrue “Adekunle police station in Lagos State was not set ablaze. Disregard the rumour please.”  For more clarification, dubawa visited the Adekunle Police Station to examine its true state. It was as quiet as a graveyard with very few people seen on the street, with Just cars driving to their destination and a handful of people at the police station itself. No signs of fire or smoke in the air, all blue skies. The claims by TVC News and other individuals on social media that the Adekunle police station at Yaba, Lagos was set ablaze by the #EndSARS protesters are completely false and should be regarded as disinformation.

"Claim: According to a study undertaken in 30 locations by the Côte d’Ivoire Red Cross in December 2015, almost 78 per cent of people in the country know that malaria is transmitted by mosquitoes; however, around 12 per cent still think that hot sun can cause malaria. Thirty-six per cent know at least three symptoms of malaria, and only 14 per cent can mention at least three ways to avoid it.","Claim: According to a study undertaken in 30 locations by the Côte d’Ivoire Red Cross in December 2015, almost 78 per cent of people in the country know that malaria is transmitted by mosquitoes; however, around 12 per cent still think that hot sun can cause malaria. Thirty-six per cent know at least three symptoms of malaria, and only 14 per cent can mention at least three ways to avoid it.  Prolonged exposure to the sun cannot cause malaria, except  a female mosquito carrying the disease. Also, a Côte d’Ivoire radio presenter and Red Cross volunteer, Ulrich Kouame, noted that some communities in Côte d’Ivoire where malaria remains one of the most pressing public health issues also believe “that you will get malaria if you stay in the sun for a long time or if you eat a lot of mangoes.” These beliefs are not only held by Ivorians, many other people also think exposure to the sun results in malaria. Malaria is a common and life-threatening disease in many tropical and subtropical areas. It affects more than 500 million people worldwide and causes one to two million deaths every year. According to a report by the World Health Organisation (WHO), there are currently over 100 countries and territories where there is a risk of malaria transmission, and these are visited by more than 125 million international travellers every year. A United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, report notes  that biologic characteristics and behavioral traits can influence an individual’s risk of developing malaria and, on a larger scale, the intensity of transmission in a population. Is long exposure to the sun one of these traits, as assumed by many people? Another volunteer on the radio programme, Kone Amy, added that, “convincing communities to use mosquito nets does not really help unless we tackle the roots of their beliefs, understand why they are so rooted in their way of thinking, and discuss the true causes with them.” But, are these beliefs and perceptions true? Is hot sun truly the major or one of the main causes of Malaria? Scientifically, malaria is caused by infection with a parasite called plasmodium, a leading cause of death in Africa since remote times which is spread through the bite of female mosquitoes that carry it.  The natural history of malaria involves cyclical infection of humans and female anopheles mosquitoes. The parasite in an individual develops and increases first in the liver cells and then in the red cells of the blood. In the blood, successive broods of parasites develop in the red cells and ruin them, delivering female parasites (“merozoites”) that carry on the pattern by invading other red cells. A public health expert at the University of Calabar Teaching Hospital, UCTH, Funmilola Shiyanbade, said a false assumption about hotness of the body and fever empowers the ligering belief. She said, “thinking through the minds of the people carrying this myth, I’ll say that since many believe that malaria as a disease condition is synonymous with fever (hotness of the body), they assume that since the body becomes quite hot under the sun, and whoever develops malaria also manifests with high fever, then the sun causes fever! But this is not true.” She added that it is well known that when we walk or work for a long period under hot sun, we are bound to become tired and weak because we lose fluids in the form of sweat. These two signs of weakness and tiredness, she said, are also found in a person with malaria; but the cause in this case is not the sun but the pathology due to the presence of plasmodium falciparum (most times) in the blood. She said further, “Malaria is an infection caused by a parasite called plasmodium which can only be transmitted through a female anopheles mosquito from the blood of an infected person to another. So, the myth that the heat of the sun causes malaria is to be discarded. The sun does not and cannot harbour the plasmodium that causes malaria neither can it transfer blood from one person to another.” Also according to the CDC published report, the blood stage parasites are those that cause the symptoms of malaria. When specific kinds of blood stage parasites (gametocytes, which happen in male and female forms) are absorbed during blood feeding by a female Anopheles mosquito, they mate in the gut of the mosquito and begin a pattern of development and increase in the mosquito. After 10-18 days, a form of the parasite named ‘sporozoite’ migrates to the mosquito’s salivary glands. When the Anopheles mosquito takes a blood meal on another human, anticoagulant saliva is injected alongside the sporozoites, which move to the liver, thereby starting a new cycle. Thus the infected mosquito carries the illness from an individual to another (acting as a “vector”), while infected individuals transmit the parasite to the mosquito, In contrast to the human host, the mosquito vector has no problems with the presence of the parasites. Also, Malaria parasites are microorganisms that belong to the genus Plasmodium. There are more than 100 species of Plasmodium, which can infect many animal species such as reptiles, birds, and various mammals. Four species of Plasmodium have long been recognized to infect humans in nature. In addition there is one species that naturally infects macaques which has recently been recognized to be a cause of zoonotic malaria in humans. (There are some additional species which can, exceptionally or under experimental conditions, infect humans.) A Professor of Epidemiology and Family Physician at the Department of Epidemiology and Medical Statistics at the University of Ibadan, Professor Ajayi, in a report published by Nigerian Tribune also said “malaria is not caused by stress or walking in the sun.” She said malaria is an infection caused by a parasite (plasmodium) that is only transmitted by the female anopheles mosquito from an infected person’s blood to another person through its bite. Prof. Ajayi noted that “there has been this notion by many people that stress or exposure to too much sun causes malaria. This is not true. The only thing that causes malaria is the malaria parasite. Nonetheless, people under severe stress can have the symptoms that somebody who has malaria also has, like tiredness, feeling unwell and loss of appetite for food. This is similar to a person that after walking in the sun for long feels tired, dehydrated or hot in the body. All the symptoms make them think that they have malaria.” She added that if the blood of many people living in malaria-endemic areas like Nigeria are tested, it may contain malaria parasites even though they do not have signs and symptoms of malaria. She, however, said under severe stress, such individuals already with malaria parasites in their blood stand a higher risk of developing malaria. Professor Ajayi added that: “It has been shown that when people are stressed, the body immunity comes down. The lower immunity now affords the malaria parasites in the blood to exhibit itself in the form of signs and symptoms of malaria. So whether it is stress arising from daily living or walking in the sun, you must have that parasite in your body for stress to precipitate malaria infection.” The issue with the popular myth about prolonged exposure to sun as a cause of malaria can also be explained with a Yoruba adage that says “Bí ìyà ńlá bá gbénisánlẹ̀, kékeré á g’orí ẹni,” meaning that when there’s a major breakdown, little issues can be really overwhelming. Because prolonged exposure to the sun does break human immunity, one’s immune system becomes weak to fight malaria once a female mosquito carrying the disease bites one. Hence, prolonged exposure to the sun cannot cause malaria, except  a female mosquito carrying the disease.

"Claim: Twitter user, @Skygirl_Angie, published a video with the claim that Obasanjo is running out of the country to escape the rage of the #EndSARS protest.","Twitter user, Orente_Africa (@Skygirl_Angie), published a video on 21st October claiming that Olusegun Obasanjo, a former president of Nigeria, is running out of the country.  This video has garnered over 445 retweets and 307 likes and has also been circulated on WhatsApp. In the bid to verify this claim, Dubawa took screenshots from the video and reversed them, using the Google Reverse Image tool but no result was found. Hence, we conducted a keyword search where we found a clearer version of the video. Further, Dubawa found that the former President had earlier reacted to news of him running away as published by Guardian on 15th February 2019, suggesting that there has been speculation about him running away before the video surfaced on the 28th.

Claim: Some Twitter users claim that holding the Nigerian flag by protesters will prevent soldiers from shooting them.,"Since thousands of Nigerians started calling for the end to police brutality and total reform of the Nigerian Police, there has been a lot of information circulating in the media space. One of the viral ones is the claim that holding a Nigerian flag during a protest will prevent the Army from shooting. According to some of the tweets, the information was given by a retired colonel.  Several twitter users posted the claim urging others to continue retweeting. A twitter user identified as Davvyd Moore (@davvydmoore) posted the claim. Moore’s tweet reads; “They plan to deploy some Nigerian Army to stop protesters. Pls everyone should get a Nigerian Flag because no army will dare shoot at any Nigerian holding a flag. Advised by a retired Colonel It is a military code. #ENDSARS #EndSarsNow #BetterTogether.” As of Thursday October 22, the post has garnered over 600 retweets, over 500 Likes and 19 comments. One of the respondents to Moore’s tweet wrote; “Time to mass-produce the flag for all peaceful protesters.” Another twitter user, Charly Chap (@CharlyChap2) also posted; “All Protesters should get hold of a Nigerian flag. No military formation will move against a crowd of Nigerians waving the Nigerian flag. Get your Nigerian flag now. Please spread the news.” Since the emergence of this information, Dubawa has observed that many Nigerians  havefollowed the instruction by holding the Nigeria flag during protests. A video footage posted by Omoyele Sowore (@Yelesowore), a former presidential candidate, shows thousands of protesters holding Nigerian flags while calling for the end of police brutality and a total scrapping of SARS. Dubawa reached out to a retired colonel, Chinedu Owhonda, to ask questions on the circulating information. Col. Owhonda  said there is no such rule and that neither  is there a written constitution in the army that restricts the soldiers from shooting protesters holding Nigerian flags. He said, “for the benefit of doubt, your country flag has a representation and the symbol is you respect it by not harming anyone with the flag, but I have not seen it written anywhere that anyone holding the Nigerian flag should not be shot”. Owhonda told Dubawa that the flag symbolises something and there is no harm that will be made to somebody who identifies with it,  “For instance, during the war if you enter a church or a mosque, in the conventional setting, no one can kill you.” A check by Dubawa indicates that there is no record where Nigerian flag prevented the Army from shooting protesters.  During the #EndSARS protest in Lekki toll gate on October 20, 2020 despite unarmed protesters holding the Nigeria flag and singing the National Anthem, military officers still attacked and killed several persons and left many injured.  The Nigerian constitution and the Armed Forces Law do not have a provision that holding Nigerian Flag will prevent the Army from shooting, a check by Dubawa shows. Section 217 (2) (c) of the 1999 Constitution (as amended) provides that Nigeria’s armed forces shall suppress insurrection and act in aid of civil authority to restore order when called upon to do so by the President, commander-in-chief reinforced by Sect(8) (1) and (3) of the Armed Forces Act, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, (LFN) 2004 requires the troops to use necessary force to quell crisis resulting in deaths, injury and damages to properties.  The Armed Forces Law expands this, citing the instances when the force could be used. A section of the Armed Forces Act reads, “Force shall be used only when absolutely necessary to achieve an immediate aim; the decisions to open fire shall be made only on orders and under the control of the on-scene commander, unless there is time to obtain such order”, adding that fire can however be opened if the life of a soldier, any law-abiding member of the public and/or property of which it is the duty the force to protect is in grave danger then fire must be aimed at controlled, and indiscriminate firing is not permitted.” With the evidence gathered, holding a Nigeria flag cannot stop the army from shooting protesters as such provision is not stated in the Nigerian constitution nor is it written as part of the Army rules.

"Claim: Senator Dino Melaye shared a photo of his G-Wagon SUV riddled with bullets at the back with Endsars written in the caption. Although the Senator did not mean to suggest the damage to his car was done during the #EndSARS protests, the photo has misled many.","Former Nigerian senator from Kogi West Senatorial district on Tuesday shared on October 20, 2020 a photo of his G-Wagon riddled with bullets at the back on his Instagram and Twitter.  He captioned the post thus: “My G wagon riddled with Bullets. Thank God am alive today. Endsars.” Although the Senator did not mean to suggest the damage to his car was done during the #EndSARS protests, the photo might be misleading.  Some of the responses to his post suggest that some people think it was from the #EndSARS protests which are currently ongoing across the country and in some cities across the world.  Nigerians have in the past two weeks taken to the street to demand the scrapping of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS), a controversial and dreaded unit of the Nigerian Police Force (NPF). Even after the unit has been disbanded, the protests have continued with further demands which include a total reform of the Nigerian police.  To join the conversation, Senator Melaye has been posting old photos of his several encounters with the police but some people however believe this particular photo is from the #EndSARS protest.  For instance Twitter user @footballchiefng while responding to the post wrote; “Thanks for joining us in the protests sir. God will bless you with more cars.”  Another Twitter user @insidedeltang tweeted with the belief that the photo was from the #EndSARS protest; “Dino, this was not done by the protesters. It must be from thugs or the police #EndSARS. ” “OMG! This is so sad. A whole G Wagon riddled with bullets. It’s a really great comparison to bodies riddled with bullets,”  Also, Olubunmi with the Twitter account @BuFamz tweeted berating the Senator for talking about his car when people have lost their lives.  Another responder Lisa Rose (@Lisa_rose5) was not pleased with Melaye’s post and wrote; “Talking about G-Wagon riddled with bullets while the body of many Nigerian youths are riddled with bullets and their bloods flowing in the street for demanding good governance.”     “We thank God for your life Sir. Some of us aren’t that lucky, despite how studious, gifted, talented and hardworking we are, we still cannot live well. Now they are event hunting us, and now that we turn they say it is violence! Hmmm! What a country! I weep for this nation,” Tosin Agbaje (@AgbajeTosin8) wrote in reaction to Senator Melaye’s post.  A simple image search revealed that the photo was from March 2018 when he claimed it was from assassination attempts on his life.  The image search on Google revealed that the photo has been on the internet since March 2018. It was the senator himself who posted the photo on social media.  The one-time Kogi State governorship aspirant at that time claimed to have survived three attempts on his life. In March 2018, he posted the photo and wrote ”After facing death in the face in kogi twice, will you want to be set up to die in Kogi again? Watch this”.

Claim: The viral photo of a man carrying what seems like a dead body draped in the Green-White-Green flag of Nigeria has been used to depict the Lekki Tollgate attack.,"Claim: The viral photo of a man carrying what seems like a dead body draped in the Green-White-Green flag of Nigeria has been used to depict the Lekki Tollgate attack.  A check of the photo shows that it is not connected to the Lekki Tollgate incident. Following the gun attack on peaceful protesters by security forces at the Lekki Tollgate on Tuesday, October 20, 2020, a photo of a man carrying what seems like a dead body draped in the green-white-green flag of Nigeria has been depicted as one of the victims.  A popular Twitter account @Tutsy22 with more than 237,000 followers was one of the persons that shared the photo with reference to the Lekki tollgate attack.  “The flag of Nigeria was first designed in 1959.On 20th October 2020, the flag was redesigned with three vertical bands of green, RED, green. The two green stripes represent Nigeria’s natural wealth, while the RED stripe represents the death of Nigeria Youth!!!,” the account wrote while sharing a collage of photos including the photo in question.  Another Twitter user @filababi, shared the photo with the caption; ‘My cousin is dead,’.  Nigerian singer Yemi Alade shared the photo on her Twitter account @Yemialadee while reacting to news of the shocking incident.  To fact-check this depiction, Pulse did an image search which only brought links related to the Lekki tollgate incident. Pulse also saw a claim that the photo was from an Independence Day drama by Youth Corps members from the Nigeria Christian Corpers’ Fellowship (NCCF) in Akwa Ibom on October 1, 2020.  Pulse followed up on that claim and spoke to Onyinye Francis, one of the corps members in the Drama Unit of NCCF who confirmed that the photo was from the play titled ‘Heal our Land’.  “The lady he is carrying is not dead, it was a drama we acted on 1st of October 2020 in NCCF Akwa Ibom State themed ‘Heal our land,” Francis told Pulse on the phone.   Pulse also saw the said photo and other photos from the play which were posted on Instagram page @afro_debbie, by one of the actors Ayomii on Monday, October 12, 2020, a week before the Lekki Tollgate incident.  The above findings prove that the viral photo of a dead person wrapped in blood-soaked Nigerian flag is not from the gun attack that happened at the Lekki Tollgate.

"Claim: a Facebook user shared a video, claiming that Bola Ahmed Tinubu was chased out of France recently.","The #EndSARS movement in Nigeria has no doubt stimulated an upsurge of turmoil that has developed into massive protests all over the country. As a result of this upsurge, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, the leader of the ruling party, All Progressives Congress (APC) has been under heavy criticism for his alleged role in some of the ongoing drama emanating from the #ENDSARS protest. It’s in line with the theme that a Facebook user, Kola Victor, shared a video with the tag “thank God they’ve chased Tinubu away from France just now”. The video depicts innocuous chaos, with some persons and police at the scene that appears to be a European society (which the claimant poised  to be France.) Already, there are unsubstantiated lingering reports about Tinubu’s departure to France but this claim seems to have drawn a conspicuous attraction from social media users with 18 diverse opinions and  720 reactions. Toala Oguntayo argued that “this is not Tinubu, please leave this man alone;” however, Racheal Somuyiwa, who appears to have already agreed with the claim commented that “I am happy with the way you people embarrassed Tinubu atlas man.”  Nonetheless, Dubawa opts to verify the claim, not putting aside the impact it may have on society, especially at a time when matters in Nigeria are  currently at a sensitive climax.  Preliminary analysis of the video on InVid Video verifier confirmed the footage to have been captured with a mobile device somewhere in the UK not in France. Further analysis revealed that the van in the video,  is a typical UK police van and the plate number  it bears reflects the UK ‘FPU” private number plate. Even more, the police officers in the video are putting on a typical UK police uniform; black trousers and lemon green jackets,  which is not in any way similar to the French Police uniforms.  Although the video ties the claim to  Mr. Tinubu, he is not seen or sighted throughout the duration of the brief video clip. Also,  no audio narrative or text within the video suggests that Mr. Tinubu was there at the scene or that the event even transpired somewhere in France. This video is misleading. First, it failed to portray the content of its claims. Second, an analysis carried out proved the event in the video took place in the United Kingdom, not in France. This claim is false.

"Claim: A facebook user, Chukwudi Ufondu, shared a photo claiming that the Catholic Bishops Conference of Nigeria held a prayer walk in support of #EndSARS recently.","Ufondu, with a followership of 82504 on Facebook, claimed in a post accompanied with a photo, that the catholic bishops recently staged a prayer walk in solidarity with #EndSARS protesters.  He said in his post: “In case you missed it, yesterday the Catholic Bishops Conference of Nigeria held a Prayer walk in Support of #endsars. Even the 77 year Old Emeritus Archbishop of Abuja and Prince of the Mother Church His Eminence Cardinal John O Onaiyekan CON Participated actively.”  The post has gone viral with about 279 shares already on facebook within a short time after he made the claim. But how true is the claim? End Special Anti-Robbery Squad or #EndSARS is a youth-led movement against police brutality in Nigeria. In 1992, the Nigerian government set up the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) as a branch of the Nigerian Police with the remit of tackling armed robbery, kidnapping, and other firearms crime. However, a columnist, Ahmed Olayinka Sule, wrote that in recent years, some SARS members have been involved in extortion, rape, torture, and extra-judicial killings of innocent Nigerians.  Most of the victims of this abuse of power have been Nigerian youths. In response to the crimes against humanity perpetrated by SARS, the Nigerian youths formed the #EndSARS protest movement around 2017 as an online movement with the key aim of abolishing the SARS unit. Over time, the movement gained momentum, Nigerians started seeing young men and women marching on the streets to put pressure on government officials. Did the Catholic Bishops Conference of Nigeria hold a prayer walk in support of #EndSARS protesters? A reverse image search showed that the photo of the protesting bishop first surfaced on the internet on March 1, 2020, contrary to the claim that it was a recent photo. A news platform, The Sitenews,  published the photo showing that on March 1, 2020, dozens of Catholic bishops marched on the streets of Abuja against the rising wave of insecurity and killings in Nigeria. “The march, which kicked off from the National Ecumenical Center, has a large number of Catholic Bishops among participants. Carrying different placards, the protesters are demanding for a better and safer society,” the news platform reported then.   Similarly, a twitter page, Signal tweeted the same photo using its handle, @thesignalng, on March 3, 2020. “Nigerian Catholic Bishops March to Protest Massacre of Christians,” the tweet read.  The claim is false. It is a hoax and no such prayer walk in solidarity with #EndSARS protesters by catholic bishops ever took place. A reverse image search showed that the photo accompanying the claim was taken on March 1, 2020 when the bishops walked the streets of Abuja to protest insecurity in the country.

Claim: a user on Twitter claims that the United Nations constitution stipulates it to intervene in any country’s protest that lasts for more than 30 days.,"Since the onset of the #EndSARS protest in Nigeria, the headlines of most media outlets have been preoccupied with diverse topics that relate to the protest. Even more practical is the center stage that social media has taken in popularizing the protest and its cause. As a result, multiple claims have emerged with conspicuous narratives and inspiring themes about the protest.  In this regard, a Twitter user,  ilobecky @AkhilePeace  claimed that the Nigerian government is responding to the #EndSARS protest because the United Nations constitution intervenes in any protest that lasts over 30 days.   The actual tweet of the claimant stated “I just heard according to UN Constitution any protests that reaches 30days will make UN intervene in that country. The Nigeria Govt knows this. Many young people don’t know it. EXCEPT the govt makes visible tangible immediate changes, #EndSARS protests MUST GO ON. Tell others.”  The tweet garnered over 250 retweets, 137 reactions, and 10 comments that ranged from doubts, consent, and disagreement over the tweet.  “This is not true. Intervention comes after a resolution from the Security Council. They can only condemn it or issue a press release about it.” agreed Ayo @stoe1234 who seems to consent with the claimant. Nonetheless,  Icon @Icon_Ayodeji argued that “Falz a supposed lawyer shud know better. UN has no constitution and u cannot intervene in any country without security council resolution.” Whatever the case may be, such conspicuous claims can attract massive public attention, especially at a time when the condition suits the narrative. Hence, it’s courtesy to this disposition that DUBAWA opts to verify the veracity of this claim.  At the preliminary level,  Dubabwa found out that the United Nations has no ‘constitution’ and the closest document that looks like a constitution is the United Nations Charter. However, it is not written anywhere in the Charter that the UN can intervene in a country on account of protests.  Nonetheless, one core value of the United Nations is ‘sovereignty’ as spelled in Article 2(7) of the Charter. It states that: ‘’Nothing contained in the present Charter shall authorize the United Nations to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state or shall require the Members to submit such matters to settlement under the present Charter, but this principle shall not prejudice the application of enforcement measures under Chapter VII.” In essence,  the United Nations cannot intervene in the domestic jurisdiction of a member state except in the case of an internal war. By interference in the war, it means they can only aid humanitarian assistance in cases of human rights violation and not to affect the outcome of the war.   A lawyer and expert in international law, Samsudeen Alabi, said the UN cannot intervene except in extreme and rare cases. “The proposition is false in its entirety.  What is going on in Nigeria is an internal conflict. The UN has as one of its guiding principles, the respect for the sanctity of a nation’s territorial integrity and political independence. And so the UN is not authorized by its charter (the document establishing it, sort of its own constitution) to intervene or interfere in the internal conflicts of its member states such as Nigeria.  “Legally speaking, the UN can only intervene after a very lengthy process has been complied with. And this process can even only be started when the internal conflict threatens “international peace and security”. All that the UN can do for now in the case of Nigeria is to “urge” and “advise” and “exhort” the government not to be violent with its people and to look toward settling its internal conflicts peacefully.” Also, a recent briefing by Stephane Dujarric, spokesperson for Secretary-General of the United Nations, António Guterres, on Thursday, 15 October 2020, made clarifications as regards the #EndSARS protest in Nigeria. He stated that “In answer to questions about the ongoing protests in Nigeria, the spokesperson said that the Secretary-General is following the protests in Nigeria calling for the dissolution of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad and an end to human rights violations allegedly committed by security agencies.  The Secretary-General stresses the importance of respect for peaceful protests and freedom of assembly and calls on the security forces to exercise maximum restraint in the policing of the demonstrations. The Secretary-General welcomes the decision by the Government of Nigeria to disband the Special Anti-robbery Unit and undertake broader police reforms. He expresses the readiness of the United Nations to accompany Nigeria in those efforts.” The viral Twitter claim that the United Nations would intervene after 30 days of protest is False. The United Nations does not have the right to interfere in the domestic affairs of any member country according to 2(7)  of its charter. The organization can only provide humanitarian assistance in cases of internal wars (civil wars) without any intention to affect the outcome of the war.

Claim: A report by the Authority Newspaper claims that daughters of President Muhammadu Buhari and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo brought about the dissolution of SARS.,"Amidst the continuous protest against police brutality and the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS), the  Authority Newspaper, in a report published on Monday, October 12, 2020, claimed that the daughters of President Muhammadu Buhari and the vice president, Yemi Osinbajo, brought about the dissolution of SARS.  According to the report, with the headline “How Buhari, Osinbajo’s daughters brought SARS down”,  the Instagram post by Kiki Osinbajo and Zarah Buhari brought the pressure that led to the final disbanding of the Squad. The report, which could still be found on the website of the newspaper on Friday morning,  leads with these paragraphs, “Unknown to Nigerians, the daughters of President Muhammadu Buhari and Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo, brought the pressure that led to the final disbandment of the notorious Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS). “Zarah Buhari and Kiki Osinbajo, were in the fore among Nigerian influencers who kicked against the abominable acts of the defunct SARS.” Apart from their efforts on Instagram, the report made no reference to any other activities involving the two that led to the acclaimed role of the duo and what  they they did to bring the police agency down The Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) was created in 1992 during the General Ibrahim Badamosi Babangida military junta. A retired Commissioner of Police, Simeon Midenda, was quoted in a December 23, 2017 report by Vanguard newspaper to have claimed that  the unit was created by his effort. Midenda was quoted to have said, “SARS was founded by me in 1992. For a proper understanding of this, historical background to its formation is relevant. Anti-Robbery as the modus operandi of the Nigeria Police Force for combating armed robbery has been as old as the Police Force itself. As a unit also, anti-robbery had always existed in all Criminal Investigation Departments at Force Headquarters, Zonal and State Command levels. To claim that I founded SARS required explanation.” The hashtag #ENDSARS is a movement that started on Twitter against the brutality of a special unit under the police force known as Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS). SARS has been accused of unlawful arrest, torture, and murder of Nigerian Youth.  -Release of all persons arrested and justice for victims of police brutality -Setting up an independent body to oversee the investigation and prosecution of all reports of police misconduct (within 10 days) -Psychological evaluation of all disbanded SARS officers before they can be redeployed,  -Increase in police salary. On the heels of the #EndSARS protest nationwide, the Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, on Sunday October 11, 2020 announced the dissolution of SARS alongside other major police reforms. These reforms include the formation of an investigative team including civil society and human right groups, to investigate alleged cases of human rights violations by the police Following this, the presidential panel on reform of SARS also accepted the demands of these protesters, but the #ENDSARS movement initially aimed at ending SARS has  extended to other issues plaguing the Nigerian society.  A keyword search showed screenshots of this paper’s report had gone viral, with some condemning the media for what it described as poor journalism.  An Instagram post by Nsifioke said media houses in Nigeria are dead. Looking at News reports, a report by the Guardian noted that the daughter of the president and vice president joined the #ENDSARS campaign by airing their views on Instagram. A similar report by the Vanguard also noted that the daughter of the president and vice president joined the #ENDSARS protest by the post they shared on Instagram. The report noted that while Kiki Osinbajo shared an Instagram post, Zahra Buhari shared her opinion on her Instagram story. Another report by Premium Times noted that both the daughter of the President and that of the vice president took to their Instagram handle to show their support for the #ENDSARS movement but the daughter of the president, Zahra Buhari, took down her post afterwards. Dubawa went further to verify these reports by checking out the Instagram pages of Zahra and Kiki.  A Google reverse image search also showed different platforms that the screenshot of this paper had been shared.  A twitter post by @Deshysmalls with the screenshot of the Newspaper questioned the editor of the paper.  Similarly, another post by OlajideTV questioned what sort of blunder this report could be. Dubawa reached out to Zahra Buhari and Kiki Osinbajo on Instagram via direct message to get their reaction to the report by Authority Newspaper but there was no response as of the time of publishing this check. Dubawa,  also reached out to the newspaper to get reason for that report via email but is yet to get a response. Habib Oladapo, the Project Manager of Civic Media Lab said the report was already discredited by further developments. He said, “I think the newspaper was just playing on the fact that there was a statement later that evening that SARS has been disbanded so they were trying to give credit to those people probably because they are related to prominent people or the authorities. Maybe that is why it was done but that is totally false. there were also issues that came after and of course the protest still continued after that so that totally discredits their report”. To Moturanyo Alaka, the Executive Director, Wole Soyinka Centre for Investigative Journalism (WSCIJ), the report is an example of sensational journalism. “The report is an example of sensational journalism. The body of the piece provides no evidence of the claim of its headline. It in no way represents the standard or stance of the Nigerian media,” she said. While it is true that Zahra Buhari and Kiki Osinbajo supported the #ENDSARS campaign, the headline and report by Authority newspaper stating that they brought down SARS is misleading.  Despite making their support known a day to the dissolution of SARS by the IGP, they did not in any special way influence the movement, aside sharing their opinions like every other Nigerians did on their social media account. It is also incontrovertible that both daughters did not come out to join the protest or lead any protest.

Claim: A video shared on Twitter purporting to show the damage caused by burglars at a shopping mall in Osun State was claimed to have been recorded over a year ago.,"The verified Twitter account of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the United Kingdom shared a video on Saturday showing damaged items and broken glasses at stores inside Osun Mall, a shopping complex located at Osogbo/Gbongan Road, Osogbo. A lady who appeared to be a shop attendant/owner wailed as residents walked through the mall, observing the wreckage. “Alleged #ENDsars #EndPoliceBrutality protesters storm Osun State Mall. Destruction and looting in progress,” the account claimed. It further urged the Nigeria Police to intervene. Reacting to the upload, however, many have claimed that the video was old. “The video is an old video. It happened during the xenophobic attack on Nigerians in South Africa. And thugs storm the mall. They are not protestors. I think I can remember this video,” one person replied. The comment, at the time of writing, was liked 420 times and shared by 140 users. “CONFIRMED: This was a protest against South African’s Xenophobia in Nigeria, not #EndSARS protest. Guys let’s report @APCUKingdom account aggressively. Una father,” said another Twitter user whose comment was respectively liked and shared over 1,800 times. Also responding to the tweet, Nonso Egemba, popularly known as Aproko Doctor, made a similar claim. “This is fake news only directed at discrediting peaceful protesters in the street. This video is from the retaliation of Xenophobic attacks here in Nigeria. Report please,” he tweeted on Sunday. His tweet was liked over 4,500 times and shared over 9,000 times as of 4:30 pm on Sunday. His account on the microblogging platform has over 626,000 followers. Many other tweets with similar claims also gathered hundreds of engagements. Last year, in reaction to xenophobic attacks in South Africa against nationals of other countries, including Nigeria, Nigerians had taken to the streets in protest and looted businesses perceived to have been owned by South Africans. Riots in Pretoria and Johannesburg that started on September 1, 2019, had led to the death of at least 12 people. Back in Nigeria, retaliatory attacks against South African political and business interests took place starting from the next day, September 3. Fire was set to a Shoprite outlet in Lekki, Lagos, by angry protesters, and an MTN shop was looted and attacked the same Tuesday in Uyo, Akwa Ibom. Another MTN outlet was vandalised in Ibadan, and then an attack on a Shoprite mall in Lugbe, Abuja, was foiled by the police on September 4. The dust on the streets of Nigeria had already settled by the time an envoy from the South African government visited President Muhammadu Buhari on September 16 and offered “profuse apologies” over the violent incidents. There is no record of a protest taking place in Osun State over xenophobic attacks in South Africa in the period. The protests held in September 2019 included only one over a hike in electricity tariff and fuel price and the alleged killing of a young man by law enforcement officers.  Based on information from the Facebook page of one of the brands (Femtech Information Technology) captured in the video uploaded by APC United Kingdom, HumAngle deduced that its shop in Osun Mall was opened months after the anti-xenophobia attacks. “Do you reside in Osogbo and its environs? Are you in need of a smartphone, accessories, laptop, solar and inverters and other I.T gadgets? We are finally here for you! Your One-Stop I.T Firm. Locate us now at Shop 2, Osun Mall, Gbongan Road, Osogbo, Osun State and get a free GIFT for every of your purchase?” the company announced on December 9, 2019. Osun Mall itself was opened to patronage on December 5, 2019. The foundation for the mall was ceremoniously laid by the governor on July 2, 2018, and as of November 15, 2019, the N2.7 billion complex was reported to have “almost [been] completed and hopefully will be ready for use soon.” Therefore, while the looting and destruction of shops connected with what happened in South Africa took place in September, that of the Osun Mall was more recent and could not have happened at the time. Various reports have, meanwhile, stated that the attack of the mall indeed occurred on Saturday, October 17, but was staged by hoodlums, not people advocating under the #EndSARS campaign as insinuated by the APC United Kingdom handle.  The claim that the video was shot during the 2019 anti-xenophobia outrage is false. ",attacks,19/10/2020,https://dubawa.org/video-of-burgled-osun-mall-not-recorded-during-anti-xenophobia-protests/
Claim: viral video has claimed that protesters are involved in attacks in Ebute Metta communities in Lagos.,"A viral video showing a group of young men vandalising cars on a street said to be in Ebute Metta area of Lagos has gone viral on WhatsApp. The same video was posted by Segun Awosanya, popularly known as @Segalink, human rights activist and Twitter Influencer on 14th October, with a caption urging protesters to work together to not be blamed for the disturbance.  “This was alleged to have happened in Ebute metta yesterday night. We need to close ranks and allow security operatives to resume their patrol duties lest insecurity is blamed on the agitation. The struggle didn’t start on the streets. It shouldn’t cost us more than necessary. Folded hands” – @Segalink The video, since published, has garnered over 2.7K likes and 2.2K retweets. And while there have been speculations that the boys wreaking havoc were protesters from the #EndSARS movement, comments from residents of Ebute Metta have identified those involved in damaging of cars as cult members who have been terrorizing the area from years back. One user quoting the tweet from Segalink also said, ‘Hi @Segalink, I stay at Ebute Metta and was very much aware of this incident; they’ve been causing and wreaking havoc like this for a week now over turf/cult wars… There are two police stations nearby (Denton/Panti), none respond to our calls when they start raging!!!’ In the bid to set the record straight, Dubawa copied the link to the video and pasted it in the InVid FakeNews Debunker extension which produced several results unrelated to the video in view. This usually happens when the video is new on the internet.  As the first attempt proved futile, Dubawa conducted a keyword to trace everywhere the video has appeared and compared the accompanying captions. We found a tweet that reveals the name of the street where the event in the video took place as Freeman Street, Ebute-Metta, Yaba, Lagos State, just as the voice in the video has said.  In furtherance to our search, Dubawa reached out to some residents of the area by phone; they all requested to be anonymous for fear of being traced. Dubawa changed the names of the respondents to shield their identities. In a phone conversation, Tolani, a resident, gave a short account of the incident. She said, “It happened around 7:30 in the evening. I was inside. They were breaking people’s cars, we called the Police but they did not come. They came in the morning after everything has happened.” She said the incident happened on Jebba street, Ebute Metta East. She added that the street is connected to Freeman Street mentioned in this Twitter post.  Chidinma, another resident of the street, corroborated Tolani’s words while dispelling the possibility of the attacks being orchestrated by protesters. “They (The Police) came in the next morning acting all concerned and asking how they were going to identify the hoodlums. They sent people to cause trouble making it seem like it’s us (protesters)… I think they just pay some guys to make seem like it is people that are protesting that are causing the trouble. I don’t see any reason why we (protesters) will be calm in the morning (during the protest) and then start breaking people’s cars at night; it’s very stupid. When asked about casualty, they both said one person was killed.” Abdulkabir, who Dubawa engaged through the Twitter App after seeing his post on the incident, gave his own account of the event and confirmed the location in the video to be Freeman Street.  In his words, “The violence was wreaked particularly at Ebute Metta East… The video was posted by another user but I can confirm the street is Freeman street… Many other streets were vandalized such as Ondo, Odunfa, Osholake. The fracas is said to be a retaliation war between the Eiye and Aiye confraternity. If you go to the streets aforementioned today, you would still see vehicles with broken windshields. Please note that all the information provided is without prejudice…thank you.” He added that, ‘a death was recorded (a rival cult member)… a popular Eiye tout by the name “Obe” who stays at Ondo Street was shot too but I believe (he) is recuperating currently, amongst other innocent members of the community that were robbed and injured but i have no personal interaction with the deceased or knowledge.” Dubawa also put in a call to the Lagos State Police Public Relations Officer, SP Olamuyiwa Adejobi who sent us on 14th of October a statement in respect of the Ebute Metta attacks. It was stated that the event took place at Ondo Street, one of the streets listed above by Abdulkabir as affected areas.  “The Lagos State Police Command has arrested six (6) of the hoodlums who attacked innocent Lagosians and damaged some vehicles along Ondo Street, Ebute-Metta, Lagos State on Tuesday,  13th October, 2020.” Also, the police did not mention protesters or relate the incidents to them. The statement referred to the perpetrators as hoodlums, adding that six of them have been arrested.  “At about 9.30pm on Tuesday, the hoodlums trooped out in numbers and started fomenting troubles in the area, but the police, while responding to distress calls from innocent people, chased and arrested some of them namely:  1. Qudus Oke’m’ 22, 2. Abdullahi Ajose ‘m’ 25yrs, 3. Kayi Ajayi ‘m’ 33yrs, 4. Micheal Ben’ m’27yrs, 5. Godwin Joseph ‘m’ 25yrs, and 6. Oluwasegun Akinlade ‘m’ 29yrs.” Dubawa also confirmed that all the streets (Jebba, Freeman, Ondo, Odunfa, Osholake.) mentioned in this check are all connected and under Ebute Metta. This was done with the help of Google Map. After engaging some of the residents of Ebute Metta, our investigations show that the video was from Ebute Metta as the viral video suggests. However, the attacks were carried out by hoodlums not protesters according to statements from residents and the police.

"Claim: That Gunmen attack SARS operatives in Enugu, killing six officers and many injured","On October 6, a Twitter user @OurPortHarcourt posted pictures of a fire-ravaged police station, claiming that the station was attacked by gunmen in Enugu. She also wrote that the coordinated attack led to the death of six operatives of the (now disbanded) Federal Special Anti-Robbery Squad while many were injured. It also stated that apart from setting the station on fire, prisoners were also freed. As of 11:40 a.m. of October 15, the post which has gathered 1,562 retweets and 2,715 likes was watermarked and attributed to one Icon news. The author of the claim tweeted: “BREAKING NEWS: Gunmen Clash With SARS Officers At Their Police Station In Enugu State, 6 SARS Operatives killed, Many Injured, Prisoners Set Free And Their Station Set Ablaze. More Details Coming Soon… 📸▪: Icons News” To verify the pictures, The ICIR subjected one of the attached photographs to google reverse image search to reveal if there were similar images attached to the post on the internet. Note that the four pictures were taken in the same environment. Google reverse image, which provided results in 0.87 seconds shows that the images first surfaced online two years ago when a face-off ensued between men of the Oyo State Police command and butchers in Ibadan. The incident which happened at the abattoir section of the Bodija international market in the state capital occurred as butchers in the market refused to relocate to a new market in Amosun village, Akinyele local government area of the state. The clash led to the death of four people who were gunned down by the police for allegedly trying to burn the police station attached to the market. While reacting to the killings, the irate butchers burnt vehicles parked within the premises of the police station while also destroying other valuables. In a bid to ensure proper sanitary and healthy practices among butchers in Ibadan, the state government had asked butchers in the state capital to relocate to a centralised abattoir at Amosun village. This was on account of the unsanitary circumstances of major abattoirs in Bodija, Aleshinloye, and Gege which led the State government to de-license all slabs in Ibadan for two years. The Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) was one of the 14 units under the Force Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department of the Nigerian Police Force before it was disbanded following protests by Nigerians over the unit’s notoriety and crass violation of human rights. It was established to detain, investigate, and prosecute people involved in crimes like armed robbery, kidnapping, and other forms of crimes Over the years, the special anti-robbery police unit has been accused of gross human rights violation while discharging its duties and to the extent that there have been repeated calls for the unit to be disbanded under the hashtag #EndSars, to avoid extra-judicial killing of citizens. The above findings dispel the falsity and non-conformity of the pictures. Checks show that the attached pictures show a face-off between Ibadan butchers and police two years ago.

"Claim: A picture shared on Twitter, which shows about nine corpses lined on the floor, suggests that they were victims of police brutality in Oyo State.","Some accounts on Twitter recently shared a picture of at least nine dead bodies lined side by side, suggesting that they were killed during ongoing protests that have called for reforms in the Nigeria Police. “Ogbomoso is Black. RIP to everyone we lost to the struggle,” tweeted @Cheyih_Viktah on Sunday, October 11, attaching the photograph. The post was liked by 494 users of the microblogging platform and shared a total of 1,047 times as of 4 p.m. on Thursday. The reactions showed that the claim was believed by many other Twitter users. “May they all Rest In Peace. This is how badly we are treated in our own country. We get nearly nothing from this system, yet, they still cut our lives short,” one Nigerian user commented. Another wrote, “May their souls rest in perfect peace. The Labor of our heroes past shall never be in vain.” Days later, another version of the picture, a screenshot from WhatsApp, was shared by @IyanuGreat95, along with two others appearing to show protesters in Oyo State and one of the victims of police extrajudicial killing during a demonstration in Ogbomoso on October 11. “Please let’s us not loose focus at this point, this is not the time to be drinking alcohol and partying… Let’s remember the cause and pursue it till the end.. This is why we are out! Their deaths should not be in vain. An end must come to police brutality,” Iyanu tweeted on Wednesday. The tweet was liked by 950 users of the website and shared over 2,100 times. A reverse image search done using Google revealed that the picture first appeared on the internet at 2:18 pm on October 11, thus predating the two tweets about Ogbomoso. It was uploaded by the Nigerian Tribune, a newspaper based in Ibadan, Oyo State, which perhaps explains why it has been re-shared in connection with protests that took place in the state. A report published by The World News an hour later also credited the picture to Tribune. Tribune’s report was about an attack by bandits of two communities (Kidandan and Kadai) in Giwa Local Government Area of Kaduna State, which led to the death of 12 residents. The attack took place on the afternoon of Friday, October 9, two days to the tragic incident in Ogbomoso where at least one person was killed and several others injured.  While three people were killed in Kidandan and four others sustained injuries, nine residents were killed by the bandits in Kadai and four were said to be in “critical conditions”. The nine casualties visible in the photograph are thus likely to be those killed in Kadai. The claim is false as the dead bodies shown in the photograph are victims of an attack by bandits in Kaduna State and not of protesters in Oyo.

Claim 1: The 2021 Budget Proposal contravenes the Fiscal Responsibility Act (FRA) 2007,"On Thursday, October 8, President Muhammadu Buhari presented the 2021 Budget Proposal to a joint session of the National Assembly. The proposed expenditure is put at ₦13.08 trillion. This, according to the president, includes N1.35 trillion spending by Government-owned Enterprises and Grants and Aid funded expenditures of N354.85 billion. a. Non-debt Recurrent Costs of ₦5.65 trillion; c. Pensions, Gratuities and Retirees’ Benefits of ₦501.19 billion; President Buhari stated in his speech at the National Assembly that “the 2021 Budget deficit (inclusive of Government Owned Enterprises and project-tied loans), is projected at N5.20 trillion.” However, in a statement on Saturday, October 10, Nigeria’s Former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar, claimed an alleged ₦5.21 trillion budget deficit in the proposal is over 3.5% of Nigeria’s 2019 GDP.  This, according to the former vice president, contravenes the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2007. He cited the specific section of the Act which he believes the budget proposal contravenes. The former vice president said: “The budget deficit in the proposal is ₦5.21 trillion. This amount is just over 3.5% of Nigeria’s 2019 GDP.  “This is contrary to the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2007, which provides in Part II, Section 12, subsection 1 that:  “Aggregate Expenditure and the Aggregate amount appropriated by the National Assembly for each financial year shall not be more than the estimated aggregate revenue plus a deficit, not exceeding three per cent of the estimated Gross Domestic Product or any sustainable percentage as may be determined by the national Assembly for each financial year.” Mr Abubakar also made at least four other claims in the statement (which have been highlighted earlier in the introduction) while trying to justify the alleged contravention of the FRA. Claim 1: The 2021 Budget Proposal contravenes the Fiscal Responsibility Act (FRA) 2007 Firstly, although the difference may appear not remarkable, it is important to note that the president actually stated that the deficit is ₦5.20 trillion and not ₦5.21 claimed by Mr Abubakar. Meanwhile, since the former vice president cited the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2007 to substantiate his claim, Legit.ng obtained a copy of the Act from the portal of the Fiscal Responsibility Commission (FRC) for verification. In line with Mr Abubakar’s claim, Part II Section 12, Subsection 1 of the Act indeed stated that the deficit should not exceed three per cent of the GDP.  However, Legit.ng notes that the second part of the same subsection quoted by Mr Abubakar indicates that the National Assembly may determine “any sustainable percentage” for “each financial year”. Mr Abubakar also admitted this in the later part of his statement but urged the National Assembly not to raise the percentage, alleging that it will not be in the interest of Nigeria to do so. He said: “It has not escaped my attention that the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2007 makes provision for the National Assembly to raise the threshold of the budget deficit from 3% to a higher figure.” “However, if this is done, they will be serving this administration’s interests, not Nigeria’s, because the Act says that such a threshold must be sustainable.” More importantly, a further check by Legit.ng finds out that Part II Section 12, Subsection 2 of the same Act quoted by Mr Abubakar empowers the president to raise the percentage above three per cent if, in his opinion, “there is a clear and present threat to national security or sovereignty of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.” The subsection reads in full: “Aggregate expenditure for the financial tear (sic) may exceed the ceiling imposed by the provisions of subsection (1) of this section, if in the opinion of the president there is a clear and present threat to national security or sovereignty of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.” Considering this subsection, Mr Abubakar’s claim that the 2021 budget proposal contravenes the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2007 is misleading.  Though the deficit (₦5.20 trillion) is over 3.5% of Nigeria’s 2019 GDP (above the 3% threshold stated in the FRA) as the former VP claimed, the FRA also empowers the president to raise the threshold above 3% under certain conditions. It should, however, be noted that Legit.ng cannot determine whether or not the coronavirus pandemic can constitute what the Act refers to as a threat to national security or Nigeria’s sovereignty. Claim 2: Alleged contravention of FRA escaped the notice of the Buhari administration Findings by Legit.ng indicate that Mr Abubakar’s claim that the Buhari administration did not notice the deficit is above the three percent threshold is false. In a bid to defend his claim, Mr Abubakar stated that the alleged contravention of the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2007 escaped the notice of the Buhari administration. He said: “That this escaped the notice of the Buhari administration shows a glaring lack of rigour in the formulation of the Budget. A very disturbing development.” Indeed, President Buhari noted in his speech at the National Assembly that the ₦5.20 trillion deficit “represents 3.64 percent of estimated GDP”. The president added that the deficit is “slightly above the 3 percent threshold set by the Fiscal Responsibility Act, 2007”. In what appears to be a reference to the Part II, Section 12 Subsection 2 earlier quoted in this piece, the president cited the coronavirus pandemic to justify the 3.64% deficit. “It is, however, to be noted that we still face the existential challenge of Coronavirus Pandemic and its aftermath; I believe that this provides a justification to exceed the threshold as provided for by this law,” President Buhari said. The claim that Nigeria’s 2019 GDP is approximately $447 billion is mostly true. According to the World Bank, Nigeria’s 2019 GDP is $448.12 billion. To arrive at the “over 3.5%” percent deficit claim, Mr Abubakar used the 2019 GDP which he alleged to be approximately $447 billion. The claim that Nigeria’s GDP has fallen is true. The GDP, according to the 2020 second quarter report of the National Bureau of Statistics, “decreased by –6.10%(year-on-year)”.  Mr Abubakar said since he based his calculation on the 2019 GDP, the “₦5.21 trillion budget deficit is actually far above the 3% threshold stipulated by the FRA”, claiming that the GDP has fallen sharply from the 2019 figures. The decline was attributed to the damaging impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Also, the GDP growth in the third quarter of the year has been projected by both the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to be negative. Claim 5: 2020 GDP projected by World Bank to be between $400 billion and $350 billion The former vice president further claimed that the World Bank and other multilateral institutions have projected the GDP “at somewhere between $400 billion and $350 billion.” In June 2020, the World Bank estimated in a report that Nigeria’s economy would likely contract by 3.2% in 2020. This indicates that the GDP will be about $433 billion, down from $448.12 billion it was in 2019. Also, the IMF projected -5.4% GDP growth for Nigeria in 2020. Going by this projection, the GDP is expected to reduce to about $423 billion (also using the World Bank’s figure for Nigeria’s 2019 GDP). None of these major forecasts puts Nigeria’s projected 2020 GDP below $N400 billion, contrary to Mr Abubakar’s claim.

Thus the event neither took place in Ondo State nor during this month’s election. ChannelsTv has already debunked the video as false while shreds of evidence showed that the video was carefully doctored to suit the false narrative.  Hence, this claim is false.  Claim: Picture shows suspects with bail of currency in front of them with a caption: Akeredolu/APC suffers stepback in Owo as vigilant youths arrested APC leaders with cash worth 10millon Naira. Source: Twitter, October 9, 2020 False Evidence: A scrutiny of the currency reveals them to be Nigeria’s 1000 naira notes, Zimbabwe 1, 000,000 dollar, and Ghana cedis. A  google image reverse search shows that the image has been used by different news platforms for different stories. Claim: Picture shows a withdrawal statement from ZLP candidate, Agboola Ajayi Source: WhatsApp, October 10, 2020 False Evidence: Mr Tope Okeowo, Chief Press Secretary to Agboola Ajayi who spoke to Dubawa on Phone said the withdrawal statement is a falsehood initiated and spread by other political parties.  Also, Mr Ajayi released a statement to deny the purported withdrawal.

"The Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the APC, Yekini Nabena, tweeted that the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) was created by the People’s Democratic Party (PDP).","After a series of protests against the activities of Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS), the Inspector General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, in a press briefing on October 11 announced the disbandment of the infamous unit of the Nigeria Police Force. In reaction to the announcement and continued protest, the Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Yekini Nabena, tweeted that the unit is a creation of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP). “Who created SARS? PDP,” he wrote in a tweet suggesting that the unit was established during the PDP administration. The PDP ruled at Nigeria’s federal level from 1999 when the country returned to democracy and 2015. As of Tuesday afternoon, the tweet had garnered 401 retweets, 168 likes and 468 comments. While majority commenters appear to know this claim to be false, few believe it is true.  A Twitter user, Sokunle Muiz Tosin with handle @ThisIsShoksman tweeted, “So APC was blind for 5 years? It took oppressed young Nigerian to make you do the right thing #Shameful.” Another user, named New Nigeria and tweeted via his handle @GemstoneMD said: “whatever!!! Our cry is just that #SARSMUSTEND.” One of those who thinks the claim is false, Godwin German, tweeted on his handle, @Godwin_German thus: “Read the Vanguard newspaper of today. Not PDP. It was a child of necessity that was abused and stigmatized.” Alalade Bukola Felix @alaladebukolaf1 tweeted: “SARS was created in 1992 and PDP was founded in 1998. It’s erroneous to say PDP created SARS.” How true is Mr Nabena’s claim? Firstly, Dubawa reached out to Mr Nabena but he declined comments on the ownership of the unverified handle and the claim.It should be noted that the handle has been used to issue statements on behalf of APC in the past and such statements were never denied. Information about the creation of SARS cannot be found on the website of the Nigeria Police Force, even SARS can be found as a section under the Force Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department (FCIID). A report by Vanguard traced the creation of SARS to 1992 during the General Ibrahim Badamosi Babangida military junta. A retired Commissioner of Police, Simeon Midenda, who was quoted in the December 23, 2017 report said the unit was created through his effort. In the report, Midenda was quoted as saying “SARS was founded by me in 1992. For a proper understanding of this, historical background to its formation is relevant. Anti-Robbery as the modus operandi of the Nigeria Police Force for combating armed robbery has been as old as the Police Force itself. As a unit also, anti-robbery had always existed in all Criminal Investigation Departments at Force Headquarters, Zonal and State Command levels. To claim that I founded SARS required explanation.” Also, it should be noted the PDP, to which Mr Nabena attributed the establishment of SARS did not come into existence until 1998, in the run up to the February 1999 general election which it eventually won. SARS was not a creation of the People Democratic Party (PDP) as claimed by APC Deputy National Publicity Secretary. The police unit has been in existence since 1992.

A user on an online community claims that Akwa Abasi Ibom kingdom is listed on Wikipedia as the fifth “highest” producer of oil and gas in Africa.,"On a discussion thread on Nairaland, a user by name Iluamoh claims that Akwa Abasi Ibom Kingdom lists on Wikipedia as the fifth “highest” producer of oil and gas in Africa after Nigeria, Angola, Algeria, and Libya. Nairaland is an online community and discussion forum for Nigerians. The user also claims that Akwa Ibom State has the third-largest GDP in Nigeria.  The post appeared on Nairaland at 10.08 p.m. on August 19.  This nairalander, as members of the community are fondly called, suggests that with this ranking “Akwa Abasi Ibom Kingdom and Lagos will arguably be among the top ten biggest/richest countries in Africa, if they were to be independent countries of [it] own…”  This post garnered 688 views on Nairaland, a community of about 2,544,892 members. Dubawa started verification with a google search engine quest which revealed that Akwa Abasi Kingdom does not exist.  Further, a review of crude oil production data by Trade Economics for August 2020 lists Nigeria, Angola, Algeria, Egypt and Republic of the Congo as the top five Crude oil producers in Africa. There is evidence of contradiction as the Wikipedia link attached as proof does not support this claim. It only lists oil producing countries in the world in 2019 with no reference to an Akwa Abasi Ibom Kingdom. Akwa Ibom State does exist, and it was created from Cross River State on 23, September 1987. It holds a population estimated at 5,451,277 in 2016 with a 3.5% growth projection.  Located in the South-South geo-political zone of Nigeria, Akwa Ibom State is the largest natural oil and gas reserve in the country with 31.4% at 504,000 BPD above Rivers State at 21.56%(346,000) and Delta State at 21.43%(344,000).  Nonetheless, it is not the state with the third-highest GDP as there is no such database on record. A further probe by Dubawa on the database of Nigeria’s apex statistical body, the National Bureau of Statistics, showed that Nigeria does not have GDP data for states and geo-politcal zones.  GDP stands for Gross Domestic Product which is defined by the International Monetary Fund(IMF) as the measure of monetary value of final goods and services—that is, those that are bought by the end user—produced in a country in a given period of time (say a quarter or a year). It also includes some nonmarket production, such as defense or education services provided by the government. The absence of a comparative data of state’s GDP in Nigeria makes the ranking of any state by GDP as assumed by this nairalander statistically invalid. Akwa Abasi Ibom Kingdom does not exist and does not feature on the ranking of countries or territories producing oil and gas in Africa. Although Akwa Ibom State is the largest oil producer in the country, it does not have the third-highest GDP in Nigeria. There is no way to ascertain this as there is national data on GDP of states in Nigeria.

"Claim: Television Continental (TVC), a channel based in Lagos, claimed last week that Nigeria is ranked as the worst country in the world according to the 2020 Global Terrorism Index.","During one of its programmes, Journalists Hangout, aired on Thursday, September 10, TVC reported that Nigeria “emerges the most terrorist country in Africa, ranked worse than Syria, Yemen, Somalia, and Pakistan”. “Nigeria now ranks third among the most terrorised countries in the world according to the latest report by the Global Terrorism Index,” said Ayodele Ozugbakun, the programme host. About six minutes into the show, an infographic was shown titled “Global Terrorism Index 2020” with a list of the countries ranked first and 10th most terrorised globally.  This infographic has been shared multiple times across social media in the country. Between Thursday and Sunday, it was especially posted by various accounts on Twitter, a widely used microblogging platform in Nigeria. One of those tweets was liked by 745 users as of Monday and shared over 700 times, and a second one was liked 149 times and shared by 314 users. A number of blogs and news websites have also echoed the claim. “Earlier this morning, The Television Continental (TVC) released the global terrorism index among the countries of the world for the year 2020,” Opera News stated on Sunday. “According to the global terrorism index for the year 2019 and comparing it with the year 2020s index, one can see that nothing really changed in the rankings, the same Afghanistan that topped the index last year is it the same country that is topping it this year why Nigeria maintained its third position,” the platform added.  HumAngle texted and emailed TVC on Monday for clarification but is yet to receive any response. Published every year since 2012 by the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP), the Global Terrorism Index (GTI) “provides a comprehensive summary of the key global trends and patterns in terrorism.” The index is based on statistics collected in the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) and other sources. IEP publishes the report in the last quarter of the year through its online data-centred platform, Vision of Humanity. A visit to the website on Monday, September 14, revealed that the latest GTI is the one released in November 2019. The institute’s main website also does not have a GTI report for 2020, and has only published the Global Peace Index for this year. The 2017 and 2018 reports were respectively released in November and December. IEP has also confirmed in multiple messages sent to HumAngle that the 2020 index has not been published. “It will be released in November 2020 on a date still to be confirmed,” the institute replied in an email. A Twitter account belonging to the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu, claimed on September 9 that Nigeria ranked second in the world, but this is not true. (The tweet was retweeted over 5,000 times and liked by over 4,200 users.) The report ranked Nigeria as the third-worst among a total of 163 countries, behind Afghanistan and Iraq. Trailing after the country were Syria, Pakistan, Somalia, India, Yemen, Philippines, and D.R. Congoㅡ as reported by TVC. Kanu quoted the GTI as stating that “the countries most heavily affected by terrorism are Iraq, Afghanistan, #Nigeria, Pakistan and Syria. Terrorism increased most significantly in Nigeria, where deaths increased by over 300 per cent to 7,512 fatalities”.  However, the latest report neither claimed that terrorism increased “most significantly in Nigeria” nor that deaths increased by over 300 per cent. Rather, what it states is that “deaths from terrorism in Nigeria rose to 2,040 in 2018, a 33 per cent increase.” It should be noted that while Nigeria has been ranked third-worst country on the index since 2015 when Boko Haram terrorists attacked and occupied vast areas in the Northeast, its performance has steadily improved. The ranking makes use of a score determined by the number of incidents as well as the impact of terrorism on lives and properties in each country; and the higher it is, the worse. In 2014, when Nigeria was ranked 4th, its score was 8.58. In 2015, it rose to 9.213 and in 2016, it rose further to 9.314, but it has since started to drop. The score was 9.009 in 2017, 8.660 in 2018, and then 8.595 in 2019. It is false to claim that Nigeria was ranked the third most terrorised country in the world by the Global Terrorism Index of 2020 because no such report has been released at this time as confirmed by the Institute for Economics and Peace itself.
