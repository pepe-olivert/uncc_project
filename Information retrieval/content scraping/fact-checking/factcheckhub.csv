Electoral law says contestants for House of Reps seat has to possess N70 million in cash.,"Checks by the Nigerian Fact-checkers Coalition (NFC) show that the claim is INCORRECT. To understand the legal requirements related to election expenses, we referred to the Electoral Act, 2022. Section 88 (4) of the Act states that: “The maximum amount of election expenses to be incurred by a candidate in respect of Senatorial and House of Representatives seat shall not exceed N100,000,000 and N70,000,000 respectively.” However, the law does not stipulate the nature of these expenses or whether it should be in cash. In addition, we presented Doguwa’s claims to Mr. Rotimi Oyekanmi, Chief Press Secretary to the INEC Chairman, Professor Mahmood Yakubu, and asked for further clarity: “The law does not say a House of Representatives candidate must or should have N70,000,000. No. It only states very clearly that they cannot spend more than N70,000,000 on election expenses. “So, it is not correct for a candidate for the House of Representatives seat to say or insinuate that he or she is expected to have N70,000,000.

Peter Obi claimed that over 130 million live in poverty in Nigeria.,"According to a recent report by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on multi-dimensional poverty, about 133 million people in the country, representing 63 per cent of the population, are living in different categories of poverty. The report stated that 65 per cent of the poor (86 million people) live in the North, while 35 per cent (nearly 47 million) live in the South. The National Multi-Dimensional Poverty Index (MPI) report is 0.257, indicating that poor people in Nigeria experience just over one-quarter of all possible deprivations. The report stresses that poverty levels across states vary significantly, with the incidence of multi-dimensional poverty ranging from a low of 27 per cent in Ondo to a high of 91 per cent in Sokoto. According to the report, over half of the population of Nigeria are multi-dimensionally poor and cook with dung, wood or charcoal, rather than with cleaner energy. According to the report, high deprivations are also apparent nationally in sanitation, healthcare, food insecurity, and housing. Accordingly, the incidence of monetary poverty is lower than the incidence of MPI across most states. In Nigeria, 40.1 per cent of people had been deemed poor, according to the 2018/19 national monetary poverty line, but 63 per cent have now been regarded multi-dimensionally poor according to the National MPI 2022.",TRUE,25-11-2022,https://factcheckhub.com/fact-checking-obis-claims-at-the-candidates-presidential-town-hall-series/

Obasanjo’s administration spent $16 billion dollars on the power sector – Sowore.,"There were allegations that President Olusegun Obasanjo’s administration spent $16 billion on power projects. However, there are no publicly available official records that prove this. Some members of the Obasanjo administration have refuted the claim. Also, a 2017 report on corruption in the power sector by the Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) records that Obasanjo’s administration spent $10 billion, not $16 billion on NIPP from the testimony of the former President’s Chief Economic Adviser, Taminu Yakubu, while testifying before the Senate probe committee. Similarly, a breakdown published by the Vanguard shows that the Federal Government released a total sum of N374.65 billion or $2.9 billion to the Ministry of Power between 1999 to 2006 under Obasanjo’s regime. According to the Vanguard, the breakdown was part of the report presented by the former Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Power, Godknows Igali, and the Managing Director, Niger Delta Power Holding Company, NDPHC, James Olotu, before a Senate Ad-hoc Committee probing the power sector from 1999 to 2015.",FALSE,19-11-2022,https://factcheckhub.com/fact-checking-sowores-claims-at-the-candidates-presidential-town-hall-series/

Atiku Abubakar has retired from politics and congratulated  Bola Tinubu.,"Findings by The FactCheckHub revealed that the claim is FALSE. A check on Atiku’s Instagram and Twitter pages show that he did not post such crucial statement on his social media platforms. Further checks revealed that no credible media platform also published the report. The FactCheckHub reached out to Paul Ibe, the spokesperson to Atiku Abubakar, via a telephone call. In his response to our inquiry, he described the claim as “false and a contrived statement of those shopping for validation and congratulations to the flawed and shambolic presidential election.” Ibe also sent a copy of the press release signed by Atiku Abubakar debunking the claim to the The FactCheckHub. The press statement reads thus: PRESS RELEASE I’ll never validate an illegitimate outcome of a flawed process I have been notified of a fake press release attributed to me and purportedly giving legitimacy to the widely rigged presidential election of February 25. The so-called press release did not emanate from me or my office, and it should be treated with repudiation, untrue, and deliberately contrived by those who illegally appropriated the mandate of the Nigerian people. For the avoidance of any doubt, I wish to state categorically that my lawyers still have my unflinching mandate to challenge the outcome of the February 25 presidential election. I join other lovers of democracy in Nigria and friends of our great country in the outright rejection of the pre-determined outcome of the February 25 election. I shall continue to challenge the legality of that election, alongside my party, the Peoples Democratic Party. The decision to challenge the sham election of February 25, the worst election in our democratic history, is not predicated on my personal interest but the interest of Nigeria and its people. It is aimed at deepening democracy and ensuring that we do not confer legitimacy to an outcome of illegitimacy. My commitment to the democratic struggle in Nigeria is beyond an election season.

Further checks by The FactCheckHub using True Caller revealed that the name on the WhatsApp contact is: “Keep Lagos Moving.” When The FactCheckHub sent a message to the WhatsApp number, the user identified himself as one Babajide Sanwo-Olu, who is soliciting for the support of Lagosians in the March 18 gubernatorial election.

Tinubu was the first governor in Nigeria to raise bond for infrastructure and development in Nigeria.,"A bond, according to Investopedia, is a fixed-income instrument that represents a loan made by an investor to a borrower (typically corporate or governmental). A bond could be thought of as an I.O.U. between the lender and borrower, including the loan details and its payments. Bonds are used by companies, states, and sovereign governments to finance projects and operations. Owners of bonds are debt-holders, or creditors, of the issuer. Bond details include the end date when the principal of the loan is due to be paid to the bond owner and usually include the terms for variable or fixed interest payments made by the borrower. The Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) defined a bond as tradable security issued by the borrower (bond issuer) representing a formal agreement to repay the lender (the bondholder) the full amount plus interest over the lifetime of the bond. In Nigeria, a bond may be publicly placed (i.e., listed on an exchange for trading) for trading by the public or maybe a private placement, sold to qualified investors, i.e., institutional investors (like Pension Funds, Banks, etc.) and high net worth individuals. Findings by The ICIR revealed that in 1978, the old Bendel state government headed by Husaini Abdullahi, a military governor took a bond, this preceded Tinubu’s administration in Lagos state. The Bendel State Loan Stock valued at N20 million was taken to develop housing estate in the region. The bond matured in 1988 at a 7 per cent coupon rate. Then, there was a bond taken by the Ogun State Revenue Bond, which took a N15 million, 10-year bond in 1986 for the development of a water project. When the bond was taken, Raji Alagbe Rasaki was the state’s military governor. Between 1987 and 1988, the Lagos State Revenue Bond issued a total sum of N90 million bond for the development of the Lekki Peninsula. Mike Akhigbe was the military governor then. In 1987, the first Oyo State Revenue Bond of N30 million for Adamasingba Shopping Complex and Gbagi Market Development was a 12-year bond. The Kaduna State Revenue Bond took a N60 million bond between 1989 and 1993 for the development of Ginger factory. Abdullahi Sarki Mukhtar and Lawal Jafaru Isa were the military governor and administrators, respectively, within these periods. The Edo State Revenue Bond took a N1 billion bond in 2000 for the development of Ogba Riverside Housing Estate. Lucky Igbinedion was the elected executive governor. The same year, the Delta State Revenue Bond, which took N3.5 billion to develop market, healthcare, water and education in the state. James Ibori was the governor. In 2002, Yobe State Revenue Bond and Ekiti State Revenue Bond took bonds for various developmental projects in their states, respectively. The Lagos State government under Tinubu in 2002 took N15 billion bond through the Lagos State Bond for the refinance of developmental projects in the state. As of February 26, 2015, Lagos State was leading other states with a total of N290.09 billion in bond issuance. The highest was N87.5 billion government Bond – Series 2 under the N167.5 billion debt issuance programme of 2013 for maturity in 2020. The bond raised, which was issued at a 13.5 coupon rate, was meant for infrastructure developments (roads, rail, buildings and bridges etc), health facilities, Adiyan Water Project Phase II construction, and shoreline protection work. Lagos had in 2012 issued a N80 billion bond under the Series 1 of the N167.5 billion debt issuance programme at a 14.5 per cent coupon rate for construction of Adiyan Waterworks (Phase II), infrastructure developments (roads, rail, buildings and bridges etc.), health facilities and redevelopment of Eric Moore Schools (Phase I).",FALSE,13-01-2023,https://factcheckhub.com/fashola-makes-false-claim-that-tinubu-is-the-first-governor-to-raise-infrastructure-bond/

Wike defects to APC.,"Findings by The FactCheckHub show that the claim is FALSE. Checks using keyword searches online show that the video had surfaced online with similar claims around June 2022 after the PDP presidential primary election. Analysis of the video shows that it was cut from Wike’s interview with Arise TV broadcast on July 2021. In the original video, Wike was reacting to the defection of some governors and legislators from the PDP to the ruling APC. Prior to the interview, PDP had lost three governors and other party members to the APC in the space of seven months. The River State governor responded to the question by the Arise TV anchor, Oseni Rufai, who asked if the reason members of the party, especially from the South-East, were leaving the party was because the party did not consider zoning. In the full video (29:00-32:00 minutes), Wike argued that the defectors could not justify their reasons for leaving the party. He added that their reasons should be in the interest of their people and their region and not because of their political relevance. “What makes you a man is to be able to tell your people a simple truth,” Wike said. Citing an instance, he said in the 57 minutes video: “I am leaving PDP to APC today because PDP have not done anything for South-South, PDP have not done anything in Rivers State, PDP have not done anything for my people. I would catalogue everything. I’m leaving PDP to APC. See the reasons why I’m leaving PDP to join you.

Checks by The FactCheckHub show that Charly Boy’s claim is FALSE.,"Checks by The FactCheckHub show that Charly Boy’s claim is FALSE. Charly Boy indeed referred to a recent interview granted by the INEC’s National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee, Festus Okoye, where he said election results would be collated manually. Okoye said the election would be collated manually in the interviews but explained the difference between collation and transmission of results. He states, “There is a marked difference between the transfer/transmission of results and the collation. Section 50(2) of the Electoral Act, 2022 gives the commission the absolute discretion to determine the mode and procedure of voting in an election and the transmission of election results. “Sections 60 and 62 of the Electoral Act govern post-election procedure and collation of election results. Section 60(1) of the Act provides that the presiding officer shall, after counting the votes at a polling unit, enter the votes scored by each candidate in a form to be prescribed by the commission. “Section 60(5) of the Act makes it mandatory that the presiding officer shall transfer the results, including the total number of accredited voters and the results of the ballot, in a manner prescribed by the commission. After recording and announcing the results, the presiding officer shall then deliver the same along with election materials under security and accompanied by the candidates or their polling agents, where available to such person as may be prescribed by the commission. “The implication of this is that the collation process of results is still essentially manual, but the collation officer must collate subject to his verification and confirmation that the number of accredited voters stated on the collated result is correct and consistent with the number of accredited voters recorded and transmitted directly from polling units.” Notwithstanding, other political actors have begun to question INEC’s announcement. A former presidential aspirant of the African Democratic Congress (ADC), Kingsley Moghalu, posted a thread of tweets at 5:33 p.m. the same day expressing concern. “@inecnigeria now says election results will be manually collated and transmitted? OK o! Is my not being on the ballot for 2023 a blessing in disguise after all? Like I said, I will remain engaged in nation-building from a nonpartisan standpoint,” his tweet thread partly read. INEC’s Press Release clarifying the Electronic Transmission of Election Result. Another Twitter user, Joseph Jonas (via @JosephJoJonas), warns INEC of the imminent problems if it goes ahead with its ‘decision’. “Make you warn dem oo, because they are looking for our Trouble,” he tweeted at 5:34 p.m on Sunday. INEC has, however, issued a press release clarifying the statement of its senior staff. “For clarity, the procedure for result transmission remains the same as in recent Governorship elections in Ekiti and Osun States. There will be no change in all future elections, including the 2023 General Election. “We wish to reassure Nigerians that the electronic transmission of results has come to stay.

He further clarified that the former Emir does not bear Sanusi Lamido Sanusi any longer; saying he is now referred to as ‘HH Muhammad Sanusi II.’ “We also take this opportunity to encourage readers to scrutinize the information they find online to identify false and misleading information purported to have come from eminent personalities and thought leaders,” he counselled.

Also, a keyword search on Google did not reveal anywhere or when the former Emir made the statement. Moreover, no credible media organisation in the country reported the article attributed to Sanusi. Further findings by The FactCheckHub traced the claim to a post made by Doyin Okupe, the former Special Assistant on Media and Publicity to a former Nigerian President, Olusegun Obasanjo.

The article, written in the Hausa language, was authored by Murtala Muhammad Gusau, the Chief Imam of Nagazi-Uvete Jumu’ah mosque in Kogi state. He is also a regular columnist on Premium Times. Part of the article translated using the Google Translate – a language translation platform – reads: “Dear brothers and sisters, as we wrote yesterday, we have spread the English language to attract the attention of the people, and today we are spreading the Hausa language. “As you know, there is an article by a man named Sanusi Mohammed or Mohammed Sanusi who writes on social media, criticising politicians, insulting and abusing other politicians, but some people, who have a purpose in life, and who do not know who the author is, spread the word, claiming that it was written by His Highness the Emir of Kano Khalifah Malam Muhammadu Sanusi II. “Therefore, we are trying to persuade the people to know that the attempt by some to link the writings of that man, Mohammed Sanusi, to the King is a great injustice. So, let’s be careful please! “We further draw the attention of the entire nation to the fact that the author of this article, Mohammed Sanusi, is not the Caliph of King Muhammad Sanusi II.
