"A video is being shared on social media with the claim it shows youths in northern Nigeria, angry at the outcome of the presidential election, attacking the home of the electoral body’s chairperson, Mahmood Yakubu. But there’s no evidence for this and Inec denies it.",False,"A video shared on Facebook claims that a house in northern Nigeria belonging to Mahmood Yakubu, the chairperson of the country’s electoral body, was attacked by youths.  The video, which lasts 14 seconds, appears to show a group of young people wielding sticks as they enter a compound.  It is captioned: “INEC chairman house under attack by angry northern youths, only them can do this in Nigeria”. The Independent National Electoral Commission, or Inec, is responsible for conducting elections in Nigeria. It is headed by Yakubu. On 1 March 2023, Inec declared Bola Tinubu, the candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress party, the winner of the 25 February presidential election. But opposition parties have accused Inec of vote rigging, in favour of Tinubu, and demanded Yakubu's resignation. The video was posted on Facebook with the same claim here, here, and here. But was the Inec chairperson’s house attacked? We checked.  ‘Narrative by mischief makers’ says Inec  Inec debunked the claim in a tweet shared on its verified Twitter handle on 25 March. It described the allegation as a “desperate smear campaign”. The commission said the house in the video did not belong to its chair. The statement reads: “This narrative is indeed the latest in the series of desperate smear campaign efforts by mischief makers. The public should disregard it.”",06/04/2023,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/meta-programme-fact-checks/nigerias-electoral-body-says-viral-video-doesnt-show-attack
"Despite persistent rumours on social media, there’s no evidence that the Nigerian electoral commission’s website has been hacked or that the results released by a Russian hacker show Peter Obi of the Labour Party won the February 2023 presidential election.",False,"A claim is circulating on Facebook in Nigeria that a Russian boy has hacked the Independent National Electoral Commission (Inec) website and released “authentic” results which show Peter Obi won the 25 February 2023 Nigerian presidential election. The posts include a photo of a young white man in a suit and read, in part: “The Russian hacker claims he have many Nigerian friends who hoped so much on this election and seeing what INEC is doing promotes him to take action.”  Inec is responsible for conducting elections in Nigeria. Some of the posts include a link to an article published on a suspicious-looking website, which includes the same photo as well as one of Obi and a graph showing the leaked “results”.  Apparently the hacker has revealed that Peter Obi’s Labour Party had 55 million votes, while the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) had 25 million and the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) 15 million. Bola Tinubu of the APC was declared the winner of the election on 1 March. Tinubu polled a total of 8,794,726 votes to defeat PDP candidate Atiku Abubakar who had 6,984,520 votes and Obi who had 6,101,533, according to results released by Inec.  Abubakar and Obi are challenging Tinubu’s victory in court. But this viral claim implies Obi actually won the election and Atiku came second, with Tinubu third. The claim was posted on Facebook here, here, here, here and here, and in the form of a video here. But was Inec's website hacked by a “Russian boy”?   ‘No such thing took place,’ says Inec’s press secretary Inec’s chief press secretary, Rotimi Oyekanmi, told Africa Check that the post was “fake news” that originated from “mischief makers”. “No time, either before, during or after the 2023 General Election, were the official Inec website and its Results Viewing Portal hacked by anyone. No such thing took place,” Oyekanmi said. A Google reverse image search revealed the boy in the photo is in-fact Nikolai Desyatnichenko, who was in November 2017 a 16-year-old high school student from Novy Urengoy in Siberia, northern Russia.  He delivered a controversial anti-war speech to the German parliament at the time. This was reported by various international media, including the BBC and the UK’s Times newspaper.  There is no evidence that Inec’s website was hacked or that the boy pictured in the post has said anything relating to Nigeria’s election results.",31/03/2023,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/meta-programme-fact-checks/no-nigerias-electoral-commission-website-was-not-hacked
"The result of Nigeria's presidential election is being challenged in court. But the leader of the Economic Freedom Fighters, Julius Malema, did not suggest the country should break up - a Facebook post to that effect is a fabrication.",False,"Nigerians hate themselves but yet find it difficult to separate peacefully. At least that’s the startling comment attributed to South African opposition leader Julius Malema by a Facebook post. The post claims that Malema also said: “After watching 2023 Nigeria election, I am still wondering the reason Nigeria is still living together as a country.” Malema is the leader of the Economic Freedom Fighters, the second largest opposition party in South Africa. Bola Tinubu was declared the winner of the February 2023 presidential election. He ran on the ticket of the governing All Progressives Congress party.   But the result has been challenged in court by the opposition, a process that could take months to conclude. The country also voted for governors on 18 March 2023. The claim was also shared on other Facebook pages including here, here and here, as well as on Twitter. But has Malema made such strong remarks about the political affairs of another country?  No evidence to support the claim The posts do not give details of where and when Malema made the comments attributed to him. We found no coverage of this in mainstream news outlets. As a public figure with a large following in Africa, such comments by Malema would have been widely reported. A search of Malema’s Instagram account and verified Twitter page shows that he has not commented on the Nigerian election since the presidential vote.

"An open letter addressed to Bola Tinubu is doing the rounds. But the alleged author died in 2017, so he couldn't have written it in 2023.",False,"A post shared on Facebook claims that Adeyinka Adebayo, the army general who served as the military governor of Nigeria’s western region between 1966 and 1971, has written an open letter to president-elect Bola Tinubu. Tinubu was declared the winner of the February 2023 presidential election on 1 March. He ran on the ticket of the governing All Progressives Congress (APC).   A Facebook search shows that posts about the open letter date back to November 2016. The letter can be read here, here, here, here, here and here. The open letter complains about the state of the “Yoruba nation”, a large ethnic group in southwest Nigeria, and claims that there are no Yoruba stakeholders in the manufacturing industry. “If truth must be told, the Yoruba nation has fared very badly since the advent of our new democracy. And this is not about holding power at the centre,” the letter reads, in part. The letter claims that the internally generated revenue of Lagos state, Nigeria’s commercial capital, would fall by 60% if Igbo people stopped paying taxes. It also urges Tinubu to make it his legacy to build the future of the Yoruba-dominated southwest region. The Igbo, Yoruba and Hausa are the three largest ethnic groups in Nigeria. But did the former military governor write this letter?  No, Adebayo died in 2017 Local media announced Adebayo’s death at the age of 89 in March 2017. So he couldn't have written a letter in 2023. We then checked to confirm that the letter had been written by Adebayo before his death. This led us to a local news platform’s retraction for attributing the letter to the army general in June 2016. We could find no evidence that Adebayo wrote the letter.",30/03/2023,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/meta-programme-fact-checks/no-former-military-governor-did-not-write-message-nigerias
"As the courts examine Bola Tinubu’s electoral win, claims are circulating on social media that the president-elect has said he will work with China if US president Joe Biden doesn’t personally congratulate him. But these claims are false.",False,"Nigeria president-elect Bola Tinubu has said the country would “partner with China” if US president Joe Biden didn’t congratulate him. At least, that’s the claim in a post shared on Facebook in Nigeria.   Tinubu was declared the winner of the February 2023 presidential election on 1 March. He ran on the ticket of the governing All Progressives Congress (APC).   This result has been challenged in court by the opposition. Some world leaders have congratulated Tinubu on his victory, but Biden had yet to do so personally at the time of publishing. The US department of state did congratulate Tinubu and Nigerians. The post claiming to quote Tinubu reads, in part: “I don’t care if USA President Joe Biden congratulates me or not because Nigeria has nothing to benefit from USA … If Joe Biden fails to congratulate me, my government will partner with China.” The same quote appeared on Facebook here, here, here, here and here. But did Tinubu say this?   ‘Complete falsehood,’ says president’s media aide There are no reports in local or international media that Tinubu made the statement attributed to him. If it were true, it would have made headlines. Tinubu's media aide, Tunde Rahman, told Africa Check the statement attributed to the president-elect was “fake news” and a “complete falsehood”. “President-elect Asiwaju Tinubu never said what has been attributed to him. He is too politically astute to speak like that. Those who are familiar with him and his speeches will understand this,” Rahman said. We also asked Festus Keyamo, spokesperson for the APC’s campaign council, about the statement attributed to Tinubu.

"The election in this northeastern state in Nigeria was closely watched, as it could have led to the country’s first elected female governor. But the vote was not called in her favour, as claimed online.",Checked,"Nigeria held elections for governors and state assemblies in 28 states on 18 March 2023. Winners have, at time of writing, been declared in some states, but in others the election was inconclusive or suspended. A claim has appeared online that the All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship candidate, Aishatu Dahiru, popularly known as Binani, had been declared governor-elect in Adamawa state. Adamawa is in the northeastern part of Nigeria.  Dahiru was a sitting senator, representing Adamawa Central. The election in Adamawa was closely contested between the incumbent governor, Ahmadu Fintiri of the Peoples Democratic Party, and Dahiru. Dahiru had a total of 390,275 votes while Fintiri had 421,524 votes. Since Nigeria's return to democracy in 1999, none of the country's states have had a female governor at the helm. As Dahiru ran on the ticket of the APC, the governing party, many hoped she would become the first female governor-elect in Nigeria's history. We found similar claims on Facebook here, here, here and here.  But has Dahiru been declared governor-elect in Adamawa? We checked.  Election inconclusive, Inec says According to a media report, the state collation officer, Prof Mohammed Mele, said elections in 69 polling stations were cancelled, which meant 37,016 eligible voters could not vote, or were disenfranchised. This is significant because, based on the votes that were cast for both parties, Fintiri defeated Dahiru with a margin of 31,249 votes. The returning officer in the state, Prof Andrew Haruna, declared the election inconclusive at a press conference on 20 March. Before making the declaration, Haruna read out the legal position on which the decision was based. Haruna said the election can be declared inconclusive “where the margin of lead between the two leading candidates in an election is not in excess of the total number of voters registered in polling units where elections are not held or voided in line with section 26 and 53 of the electoral act”. The election was declared inconclusive as the number of voters in the affected polling stations was greater than the difference between the two leading candidates. Dahiru has, however, not been declared governor-elect of Adamawa state.",24/03/2023,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/meta-programme-fact-checks/no-first-female-governor-elect-not-declared-nigerias-adamawa
A Nigerian-American professor of history winning a prestigious international prize led to congratulations from prominent politicians. But there’s no evidence to show that Saheed Aderinto welcomed the praise from Peter Obi while snubbing president-elect Bola Tinubu.,False,"Screenshots circulating on Facebook in Nigeria appear to show the winner of an annual prize saying he hopes Nigeria’s president-elect Bola Tinubu will restore the country’s “stolen mandate”, while calling Tinubu’s rival Peter Obi “My President elect”. Prof Saheed Aderinto is a Nigerian-American professor of history and African and African diaspora studies at Florida International University in the United States. He was announced the 2023 winner of the Dan David prize, alongside eight other history scholars, on 28 February. The prize of US$300,000 is awarded annually to nine outstanding contributors to the study of history. The first screenshot posted appears to show a tweet from Nigerian president-elect Bola Tinubu congratulating Aderinto on his achievement, and Aderinto’s reply. It reads: “Thanks anyway for the recognition, I hope you restore Our stolen mandate.” The second screenshot shows a congratulatory tweet by Peter Obi, leader of the Labour Party, to which Aderinto appears to respond “thank you My President elect”. Tinubu was declared winner of Nigeria’s 2023 presidential election by the Independent Electoral Commission on 1 March. His win is being challenged in court by Obi and Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party. These different responses are posted side by side by Facebook users, apparently to show that Aderinto took a swipe at Tinubu and doesn’t support him. The screenshots appear on Facebook here, here and here. But did Aderinto snub Tinubu while calling Obi “my president elect?” We checked.   ‘Not on Twitter’ The screenshots show the replies, supposedly from Aderinto, originating from an account with the handle @Aderinto0 and the professor’s photo as profile picture. But this account doesn’t exist.  And on 13 March Aderinto took to Facebook to say: “I don't have a Twitter account.”  The professor said he “didn't make those statements”. According to a fact-checking report by CDD Fact Check published on 17 March, the account that responded to Tinubu was “a parody account” that changed its username from @Aderinto0 to @ellup81 after the tweets in the screenshot were posted.  Some responses to the tweets in the screenshots link back to @ellup81’s account. But there is no evidence that the history professor Saheed Aderinto might support Obi over Tinubu, or has made any public comment to that effect.",24/03/2023,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/meta-programme-fact-checks/no-us300000-history-prize-winner-saheed-aderinto-didnt-ask
"Did a top Nigerian government official really make sexist remarks about the female candidate vying for the Adamawa state governorship seat? No, a viral tweet with this quote is from a fake account.",False,"“I am now 100% against Binani becoming the Governor of Adamawa as it goes completely against the teachings of Islam,” begins a tweet posted on 20 March 2023. “As much as I would love the people’s choice to prevail, I would pray that the calamity of being led by a woman doesn’t befall the good people of the state,” the tweet concluded. The tweet came from an account called “Boss Mustapha” with the handle @__yellows. Boss Mustapha is the secretary of the federation government. He also headed the presidential task force on Covid-19. Aishatu Ahmed, also known as Binani, is a politician and entrepreneur. She is a senator representing the Adamawa central senatorial district and the chairperson of the senate committee on sustainable development goals. Adamawa state is in northeastern Nigeria.

"As Nigerians vote for governors, claims have been circulated online that a candidate for a seat in the key state of Lagos has been attacked. But the photo used as evidence is six months old.",False,"A photo of Olumide Oworu, the Labour Party candidate for the Lagos State House of Assembly to represent Surulere Constituency I, has been circulating online with the claim that he was injured when thugs attacked his campaign event. Oworu, a 28-year-old actor, is running against the incumbent, an older actor and candidate of the governing All Progressives Congress (APC), Desmond Elliot. Several media reports say that Oworu’s supporters and members of his party were attacked by thugs during a campaign meeting on Thursday, 16 March 2023, two days before the governorship and state assembly election. None of the reports say Oworu was injured in the attack.  But Oworu’s photo, his face bloodied, and his white shirt stained with blood, circulated alongside reports of the attack.  “See what they did to Tari. What the thugs Tinubu and Sanwolu breeds in Lagos did to Tari. See our Tari. My heart is broken for Nigeria. Pls VOTE LP Pls,” reads one of the many tweets accompanying the photo.  Oworu is popularly known as Tari, a role he played in the TV series, The Johnsons. This Twitter user, like many Labour Party supporters, blames the APC and its leaders in Lagos, including former governor Bola Tinubu, who is now president-elect, and incumbent governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu. The photo is also circulating on Facebook with similar claims. See some here, here and here.  But does the photo show Oworu after having been attacked?  Old movie set photo A Google reverse image search led to a post Oworu made on Instagram in October 2022. It’s a post of the exact same photo, apparently taken on a movie set. Oworu posted it on his Instagram page on 3 October 2022, with the caption: “Alagbado John Wick #OnTheEdge”. So the photo is six months old and has nothing to do with the attack on Oworu's campaign.

"Just days before elections for governor across the country, a memo is circulating on social media in Nigeria with the claim that the Kaduna state government has bribed Muslim clerics. But this an outdated document, with a forged signature.",False,"A message circulating on WhatsApp and Facebook in Nigeria suggests the Kaduna state government disbursed N27 million, over US$40,000, to some Muslim clerics ahead of the elections for governor scheduled to be held on 18 March 2023. Nasir El-Rufai of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) is the incumbent governor of Kaduna state in northern Nigeria. In May 2022, he endorsed Uba Sani as his successor. Sani is senator for Kaduna central senatorial district. The message reads: “This is an internal memo from the government of Kaduna. Just see how bigotry has eaten deeply within our political system.  using State funds for religious activities contrary to section 10 of the 1999 Constitutional (as amended).” It includes a screenshot of what appears to be an internal memo from the “office of the director general (interfaith)” and the state secretary’s office.  The memo’s subject line reads: “DISBURSEMENT OF FUNDS TO IMAMS.”  The memo is dated 4 March 2019 and signed by “Muhammed Musa, director general (Interfaith)”. It continues: “The SSG may wish to note that in line with the agreed plan of providing logistics support to Imams of Jumat Mosque towards a favourable Friday sermon the Friday preceding the date of the Gubernatorial election.” But is the memo accurate?  Misleading claim and forged signature The memo is dated 1 March 2019 which makes the post misleading.  In March 2019, the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) accused El-Rufai of bribing Muslim clerics to campaign for the ruling party in mosques across the state.  Musa responded to the PDP’s accusation then. He said “he isn’t the author of the said document”.  He also told a national newspaper that “at no point in time” did he write the letter. Musa told Africa Check that his signature was forged in the 2019 viral letter.

"Nigeria’s presidential election was a close race, but claims on social media that the wrong candidate was declared president-elect are not supported by evidence.",False,"Reactions about the conduct and outcome of Nigeria's election have been mixed, days after the electoral body declared Bola Tinubu of the governing All Progressives Congress (APC) president-elect. The Independent National Electoral Commission or Inec is the electoral body responsible for conducting elections in Nigeria. But a post shared on Facebook claims that the election result displayed on the “IReV Portal” shows Peter Obi, the Labour Party candidate, as the winner of the 25 February presidential election, contradicting Inec's declaration. The Inec Result Viewing Portal (Irev) is a platform created by the electoral body for the transparent transmission of election results. The post reads: “BREAKING NEWS: Results Obtained from IReV Portal shows that Peter Obi is the winner of the 2023 presidential election.” It goes on to list the result it claimed to have obtained from Inec's website: ""LP: 19 states + FCT, PDP: 8 states, APC: 7 states, NNPP: 2 states."" Nigeria's presidential election was held on 25 February and governors' elections earlier scheduled for 11 March will now be held on 18 March.

A Nigerian teenage girl did make headlines for being selected for a prestigious international programme in November 2021. But the article circulating online in 2023 about Tomisin Ogunnubi’s achievements is misleading.,PFalse,"In late February 2023 a story went viral on social media, claiming that a 16-year-old Nigerian girl won US$1 billion with an app she designed, beating 49,000 other teenagers in a contest. “Meet Tomisin Ogunnubi, the 16-year-old Nigerian who beat 49,000 competitors to win $1 billion with her app,” reads the headline of an article published on 23 February 2023.  Several blogs republished the story with the same or similar headlines, including here, here, here, here, here and here.      The article was also linked to or reposted on Facebook here, here, here, here, here, here and here.   Headline misrepresents facts Contrary to the headline, the article says in the second paragraph that “as one of the 100 winners of the $1 billion cash prize, Tomisin received a scholarship to study abroad, mentorship, and career-shaping opportunities, as well as funding”.  The article refers to Rise, which describes itself as an initiative that “seeks to find brilliant young people ages 15-17 from around the world and support them for life as they work to serve others”.  Rise runs on a $1 billion commitment made in 2019 by former Google chief executive Eric Schmidt and his wife Wendy.  Each year winners attend a three-week-long resident summit and get full higher education scholarships, mentorship, access to a global network of winners and partners in the programme, and funding. Rise’s website says the funding ranges from seed money to start a social enterprise to a grant for a non-profit. “Funds will be designated for these purposes in a total pooled amount of at least $5 million per year of the program,” it says.  So no one is taking home $1 billion, as the viral story suggests.    ‘Many inaccuracies’ in story debunked by Ogunnubi’s dad About two weeks after the story began to circulate, Ogunnubi’s father Yinka posted a thread on Twitter to point out inaccuracies in how it had been reported. “I feel the need to address a broadcast message that has been floating around WhatsApp about my daughter Tomisin Ogunnubi. The story has a lot of inaccuracies that needs to be corrected. The story conflates many facts and presents a picture that is completely inaccurate,” he tweeted on 7 March 2023 Yinka Ogunnubi said that the claim “Tomisin Ogunnubi, a 16-year-old Nigerian tech kid beat 49,000 competitors to win $1 billion from RISE initiative with her app” was incorrect.   He said his daughter was not 16: “She would [will] be 20 in July [2023]. She won the RISE award in Oct 2021 at the age of 18. Tomisin did create a tracking app as part of a school project when she was 12 which got her national & international acclaim. But it was not because of the app that she with 100 other teenagers globally won the RISE Award.”  He also shared when Tomisin Ogunnubi’s mother tweeted about her win in November 2021 and an interview she did with the BBC after winning.

Social media posts in Nigeria claim president-elect Bola Tinubu is the country’s 16th president. But this isn’t accurate – he will become the seventh democratically elected president once inaugurated.,False,"After Nigerians voted to pick a new president and federal legislators, a claim that president-elect Bola Tinubu was Nigeria’s 16th president surfaced online. Bola Tinubu was declared the winner of the 25 February 2023 presidential election on 1 March. He contested on the ticket of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). The Facebook post reads: “Congratulations to the Progressives Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu is the 16th president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.” A video shows the percentage of votes the APC received in each Nigerian state. The video has been viewed more than 300,000 times since it was posted. The post was published days before Nigeria’s Independent National Electoral Commission (Inec) finished counting the votes and announced the winner of the presidential election. The same claim was posted on Facebook here, here and here, but without the video. Is Tinubu the 16th president of Nigeria? We checked.  Nigeria’s first and second republics According to the Nigerian government, 16 presidents and heads of state have governed the country since its independence in 1960. Nigeria’s first republic was between 1960 and 1966, during which prime minister Tafawa Balewa (1960-1963) and president Nnamdi Azikiwe (1963-1966) governed the country. The first republic ended with a military coup in 1966 and four military heads of state ruled from 1966 to 1979, when the second republic began. Shehu Shagari was the only president of the second republic, before the military regained power through another coup d’état in 1983. Nigeria was meant to return to democracy after the 1993 elections, but because of unrest an interim national government, headed by Ernest Shonekan and set up by Ibrahim Babangida, the military head of state at the time, was in place between August and November 1993. Military leader Sanni Abacha imprisoned Moshood Abiola, winner of the disputed 1993 elections, and ruled the country till his death in 1998. Nigeria finally returned to democracy in 1999 when Olusegun Obasanjo was democratically elected president. Kamilu Fage, a professor of political science at Bayero University Kano in northern Nigeria, told Africa Check that to call a military head of state a president is a matter of “semantics”.  “However, if by president we mean a democratically elected head of state, then the military head of state is not qualified to be called a president. This is because the military seized power by the barrel of a gun while a president was democratically elected.” Fage said Ernest Shonekan could not be regarded as a president because “like the military, chief Ernest Shonekan was never elected by Nigerians. He was imposed on Nigeria by the then outgoing IBB military regime”. Nigeria’s presidents since independence  Fage said from independence to 2023 Nigeria has had “six substantive presidents and a president-elect”. The six presidents were Nnamdi Azikiwe (1963-1966), Shehu Shagari (1979-1983), Olusegun Obasanjo (1999-2007), Umaru Musa Yar'adua (2007-2009), Goodluck Ebele Jonathan (2009-2015) and Muhammadu Buhari (2015-2023).  Buhari will be replaced by president-elect Bola Tinubu who is yet to be inaugurated at time of writing. After his inauguration, Tinubu will become Nigeria’s seventh president.",09/03/2023,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/meta-programme-fact-checks/no-president-elect-bola-tinubu-isnt-nigerias-16th-president
Guaranty Trust Bank asked Nigerians to ignore social media posts that falsely quoted their group CEO saying the bank had given millions of naira in new notes to president-elect Bola Tinubu.,False,"Posts shared on Facebook and Twitter claim Segun Agbaje, a senior banking executive in Nigeria, said his bank had given N500 million in new naira notes to Bola Tinubu, Nigeria’s president-elect, on orders of Muhammadu Buhari, the incumbent president.  Agbaje is the group chief executive officer of Guaranty Trust Holding Company Plc, of which Guaranty Trust Bank is a subsidiary. The social media posts call him the “MD” of the bank.  The quote attributed to him is: “We gave Bola Tinubu 500 million new naira notes on Friday, 24th February on the order of the president.”  Nigerians have endured shortages of redesigned naira notes since late January 2023, right up until they went to the polls on 25 February.  Tinubu contested the 25 February presidential election on the ticket of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), and was declared winner of the election on 1 March. We found the same quote on Facebook here, here and here. But did Agbaje really admit to this very large donation? We checked.  ‘Completely False’ In July 2021, Agbaje was replaced as the group managing director of Guaranty Trust Bank by Miriam Olusanya, following the bank’s transition into a holding company.

Abubakar won 20, but Tinubu garnered 10.",Misleading,"A Facebook post claims that Atiku Abubakar, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate for Nigeria’s presidency, has defeated the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate Bola Tinubu to win all local government areas in Osun state. It includes a link to a media report with the headline: “BREAKING: Atiku Defeat Tinubu To Win All 20 LGAs In Osun.” Osun is in Nigeria’s southwest geopolitical zone. The zone was considered Tinubu’s stronghold.  But did Tinubu suffer a heavy defeat, losing all local government areas in Osun state?   Osun state has 30 local government areas, not 20 The headline of the report is misleading and misrepresents its body text.   On 25 February 2023, the Independent National Electoral Commission (Inec) conducted the presidential and national assembly elections across the country, including Osun’s 30 local government areas.   The report correctly spells out the presidential election results Inec announced for Osun. Abubakar won in 20 local government areas with a total of 354,366 votes.

Nigeria voted for a president and federal lawmakers. One user claims they were offered N10,000 “to vote for Bola Tinubu” via the messaging service WhatsApp. Bola Tinubu is the candidate for the governing All Progressives Congress party. The message has also been published on Facebook, such as here and here.

The site has an application form that asks for details such as telephone numbers, addresses and bank details. After filling out the form, the site instructs users to share the link with five groups or 15 contacts on WhatsApp.  This is engagement bait: social media posts that ask people to interact with them by liking, commenting or sharing.

"As Nigerians vote in presidential elections, a widely shared claim is that hundreds of thousands of Chadians were set to vote for the APC, before a former president helped turn them away. This is false.",False,"A message circulating on Facebook claims that former Nigerian president Olusegun Obasanjo intercepted and helped turn back dozens of trucks carrying a million Chadians with permanent voter cards. It says the Chadians intended to vote for the governing All Progressives Congress (APC) party. Nigerians were on Saturday 25 February 2023 voting for a new president and federal lawmakers.  The APC has been in office since 2015, and is hoping to retain power with president Muhammadu Buhari set to step down after the elections. Part of the message reads:   Obasanjo received a call from a junior immigration officer ( name withheld ) that unknown 100 trucks carrying over 1million Chadians got access to the Nigeria border and were heading to Kaduna. Obasanjo responded immediately around 2pm in the afternoon , Obasanjo called immigration boss but no response from him , Obasanjo asked his personal security officials to blocked all the roads leading to Kaduna and finally , the trucks were captured.  The claim is attributed to “veteran activist, Charly Boy”.  It appears on the Instagram handle of Charles Oputa, a Nigerian entertainer with 194,000 followers. Oputa goes by the stage name of Charly Boy.    Actor Tessy Oragwa also posted it on her verified Facebook page, which has 1.5 million followers. But did any of this happen?  Ten thousand people in a single truck? Some of the claims in the message defy belief. It swings from “over 1.5 million Chadian citizens” and just “1.5 million” to “over 1 million” Chadian citizens and “nearly” 1 million Chadians. The number of trucks is constant – 100. Taken at face value, this would mean that 10,000 to 15,000 Chadians were crammed into a single truck. This is implausible.   The number of foreigners involved, the alleged involvement of a high-profile figure like Obasanjo, and what it would mean for the credibility of the election if true, means that such a story would have been widely reported in the media. We found no such coverage. A Google reverse image search of one of the photos accompanying the message reveals that it is from a 2021 incident between the police and Fulani herders in Kwara state in Nigeria’s north-central region.  Another photo used as evidence for the claim is from a 2021 arrest of armed men by Amotekun, a local security group in Oyo state, southwestern Nigeria.

It adds:  The INEC Office In Kaduna and Kano are under siege as Boko Haram has locked down the whole building belonging to INEC insisting that the election will not hold until Tinubu is relaxed with a more healthy Fulani man who stands a chance of winning Peter Obi.  The claim appeared online less than 30 hours before the start of Nigeria’s 2023 presidential and national assembly elections. This was while Inec was busy distributing election materials across the country.  No evidence for claim Kano and Kaduna are two of the most populated and developed states in northern Nigeria.  With local and international journalists deployed across the country to cover the elections, a terror attack on Inec’s offices in those states a few days before the elections would not go unreported. Africa Check found no evidence of the “top news”, beyond the few Facebook posts. And the posts provide no details. No credible media organisation has reported any attack on Inec offices in Kano and Kaduna.  Inec always reports attacks on its offices, and details casualties and items destroyed.

"Days before the Nigerian election, news of a raid on a prominent presidential candidate’s home by the financial crimes commission, seizing a large amount of new naira notes, should be ignored.",False,"A message circulating on social media in Nigeria claims that the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) raided the home of the presidential candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress and found N400 million cash. The message went viral on Facebook just a week before Nigeria’s presidential election, scheduled for 25 February 2023. The message reads: “Breaking News: President Buhari ordered EFCC to raid Tinubu's house, and 400 billion of the new money was recovered from his underground house. Investigations are still going on as to which bank manager made such money accessible to him, Tinubu holding 400 billion alone is likely holding the entire money printed for the whole Nigeria.” This Facebook post has been shared over 4,100 times. Other examples of the claim on Facebook can be found here, here, here, here, and here.   Nigeria has faced a weeks-long currency crisis after the country’s central bank redesigned the N1,000, N500 and N200 banknotes.  The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) released the redesigned notes into circulation in December 2022, and shifted the deadline for returning old notes to banks to 10 February 2023.  The CBN and president Muhammadu Buhari have insisted the old notes have ceased to be legal tender. This is despite an order by the country’s supreme court demanding a stay of action pending a suit filed by some state governments against the CBN and the federal government.  This has led to a crisis, including violent protests. Nigerians who still have the old notes are finding it difficult to spend them while the new notes are hard to find, even at banks and automated teller machines.  CBN governor Godwin Emefiele has accused politicians of hoarding the new banknotes ahead of the election. In January, Tinubu said the naira redesign and fuel scarcity in the country were meant to stop him from becoming president. Some claim that this is a sign of conflict within the ruling party and between Tinubu and Buhari.  But did the financial crimes commission find N400 billion new notes in Tinubu’s house?  Financial crimes commission debunks claims All versions of the claim on Facebook gave no further detail about the supposed raid of Tinubu’s home.  Some included links to click through for more details, but they led to an unrelated article on a poorly designed website. This is typically a sign that a post is clickbait and the claim was fabricated. Considering that Tinubu is a well-known politician and is running for president of Nigeria, the EFCC raiding his home would make news headlines. But it didn’t. This is another indication that the story is not true.  The EFCC has also officially debunked the claim. In a statement released by EFCC head of media and publicity Wilson Uwujaren, on its Facebook page and Twitter timeline, the commission referred to the claim as “fake news”.   “The Commission wishes to state that no such operation was carried out by the EFCC.

"As Nigeria struggles with a shortage of cash after a swap of old banknotes with new, redesigned currency, a press release seemingly from the central bank says the exercise will be suspended until May. But the document is fake.",Fake,"In October 2022, Nigeria’s central bank governor Godwin Emefiele announced that new redesigned naira banknotes – in the highest denominations of N200, N500 and N1,000 – would be introduced that December. The aim was to replace dirty money in circulation, fight inflation, reduce counterfeiting and promote a cashless society. But a crippling shortage of the new currency has sparked riots in some parts of Nigeria and landed the federal government in court.  In response, president Muhammadu Buhari announced on 16 February 2023 that the old N200 notes would remain in circulation until 10 April. As the saga continued, Buhari’s wife Aisha Buhari posted what seemed to be a press release from the central bank on her verified Instagram and Facebook pages. It claimed that the president had ordered the central bank to allow all old currency to remain in circulation until 1 May. The release carries the bank’s logo and the signature of its spokesperson, Osita Nwanisobi. It reads:  Due to the current and unpleasant situation happening in Nigeria, In line with Mr. president. After having a closed meeting with him on the 20th of February, 2023, Central Bank Of Nigeria (CBN) has been directed to ONLY reissue and recirculate the old N200, N500 and N1000 banknotes and this is expected to circulate as legal tender for 70 days up to May 1, 2023. Members of the public should therefore continue to spend the old notes.  The first lady has since deleted the document from her social media accounts.

The redesign of banknotes and resulting shortage of currency has caused a lot of anger in Nigeria. But the central bank says a social media claim that it doesn’t have enough printing paper is false.,False,"Nigerians have been struggling with a shortage of redesigned new banknotes. The crisis even caused president Muhammadu Buhari to allow, on 16 February 2023, some of the old N200 notes to be released back into circulation.  The shortage has led to riots in parts of the country. And three state governors have taken the federal government to court in an attempt to stop the new banknotes policy. Against this backdrop, a claim that the shortage was due to the Central Bank of Nigeria not having “enough paper” to print the new currency is circulating on Facebook. “Not enough paper to print new naira banknotes - CBN,” one post reads.

"Religion plays a prominent role in Nigerian politics, but this claim doing the rounds is false.",False,"A post circulating on Facebook claims the presidential candidate for Nigeria’s governing All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu, is about to marry a Muslim wife. She would become the country’s first lady should Tinubu be elected in the 25 February 2023 elections.  The post reads: “Senator Remi Tinubu has been shoved aside because she's a Christian. Bola Ahmed Tinubu is now set *to marry a new Muslim wife* on Saturday 18th February 2023, @ Katsina.” Katsina state is in northern Nigeria. Attached to the post is a video claimed to be the digital invitation to Tinubu's wedding to his new bride. The nuptials will supposedly be at the Katsina Central mosque on Saturday 18 February. This wedding date would be one week before Nigerians choose a new president.  Bola Tinubu is Muslim and is married to Oluremi Tinubu, who is Christian. Oluremi Tinubu is a third-term senator representing Lagos central district. She was also first lady of Lagos state from 1999 to 2007, when her husband was state governor. The leadership of Nigeria has largely rotated between the north, which is majority Muslim, and the south, dominated by Christians. A presidential ticket also tends to be split between the two religions, with the main candidate being from one and their running mate from the other. For this reason Tinubu’s candidacy has been controversial. He is Muslim and from the south while his running mate Kashim Shettima is also Muslim, although from the north. Some leaders had argued that for religious balance, Tinubu should have chosen a Christian running mate from the north. Outgoing president Muhammadu Buhari, also of the APC, is Muslim while his deputy is Christian.  The claim circulating on Facebook further alleges that Tinubu is marrying a Muslim because his wife Oluremi is considered to be an “infidel”. An infidel is a person who does not believe in a religion that someone regards as the “true” religion. The same claim appeared on Facebook here, here and here. So is presidential candidate Tinubu about to “shove aside” his current wife and marry a Muslim woman?   ‘Infantile propaganda from the opposition’ Festus Keyamo is the spokesperson of the APC’s presidential campaign council. He told a national newspaper that the claim was juvenile “propaganda” from rivals hoping to discourage Oluremi Tinubu’s supporters. “It is obviously one of those infantile propaganda from the opposition. They are just desperately targeting the Christian votes that his wife, Senator Oluremi Tinubu, is bringing to the ticket and they know she is a pastor.” Keyamo said he “won’t be surprised” if the allegation came from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), the main opposition party in the country. The PDP’s presidential candidate is Atiku Abubakar, a former vice president and one of the four frontrunners in the presidential election. As the election draws closer there has been an increase in similar disinformation, including a claim that another presidential candidate had changed his running mate.

One post reads: “Tinubu is accusing Buhari of working against his campaign by creating Artificial fuel scarcity and new naira notes crisis.” The post includes a video of Tinubu at a campaign rally saying, in the Yoruba language spoken in much of the country’s south, that the fuel shortage and currency crisis won’t stop him winning the 25 February presidential election. Nigeria is Africa’s largest oil exporter but, because of a lack of refining capacity, imports nearly all its fuel. Nigerians are no strangers to fuel shortages.

The tweet doesn’t give a source for the photo, and the account has not replied to Twitter users who suggested the photo was taken immediately after the stage was set up, ahead of the party’s arrival, and not during the rally. A reverse image search for the photo did not return any results. But there’s evidence that Obi and Baba-Ahmed had support when they arrived at the Ahmadu Bello Stadium. There has been extensive media coverage of the rally. A video of the event shows a sizable crowd.   Africa Check has checked several false claims about crowd sizes in election campaign rallies before, as published here, here, here, here and here. These kinds of claims are often used in disinformation, where the implication is that the candidate with the biggest crowd has the best chance of winning the election.

"Nwankwo Kanu and other former international footballers from Nigeria did help celebrate Bola Tinubu’s 70th birthday last year. But the one-time Arsenal star hasn’t endorsed any presidential candidate. Instead, he’s urged citizens to get their voter cards.",False,"With Nigeria’s 2023 elections just weeks away, a message going viral on Facebook claims Nwankwo Kanu, a former captain of the country’s national football team, has endorsed Bola Tinubu, the presidential candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). Several versions of the claim include a short video of Kanu talking about Tinubu donating N5 million to support the launch of Kanu Heart Foundation in 2000, when the politician was governor of Lagos state. The foundation helps fund surgery for children with heart disease whose indigent households can’t afford the treatment.  Tinubu was governor of Lagos from 1999 to 2007 and has remained an influential politician in Nigeria.   Versions of the claim can be found here, here, here, here, here and here. Peter Obi, a leading contestant in the presidential election, is the candidate of the Labour Party. Obi and Kanu are from the Igbo ethnic group in Nigeria’s southeast geopolitical zone.  Kanu, a former Arsenal football club star, did not mention Obi or Igbo leaders in the video. Their mention in the message seems to drive the narrative that Tinubu came to the rescue after Kanu’s kinsmen, including Obi, refused to help.  The frontrunners of the 18 candidates in the race for Nigeria’s presidency are generally understood to be Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party, Rabiu Kwankwaso of the New Nigeria Peoples Party, as well as Tinubu and Obi.  But has Kanu endorsed Tinubu as his candidate of choice?     Kanu clarifies his visit to Tinubu The video was shot when Kanu and about a dozen other former international football players from Nigeria visited Tinubu in Lagos in March 2022. This was a few days before the politician’s 70th birthday.  They were criticised for the visit, especially on social media.  On 20 March 2022, a day after the visit, Kanu posted a video to clarify his involvement.  In the video, he reiterated that Tinubu’s donation of N5 million had helped start his foundation. He said he and other footballers simply wanted to congratulate Tinubu on his 70th and discuss a novelty match they had planned to mark the birthday.  In the video, Kanu advises Nigerians to collect their voter cards and vote for “the right candidate” in the 2023 elections. He does not endorse Tinubu.  At the time of the visit, Tinubu was not yet a presidential candidate, and there was no guarantee he was going to be on the ballot. Tinubu only became APC’s candidate in June 2022, after he beat about a dozen others to the party’s presidential ticket. The footballer debunks the recent claim A few days after the recent claim that he endorsed Tinubu began to spread, Kanu made another video on 27 January 2023 to debunk it.  In the video, Kanu says: “I am not a politician, I am a footballer” and asks people “spreading fake news” in his name to stop. He says he has not told anybody who to vote for in the election.  “Hello, my country people, do what is right and vote. Kindly stop spreading fake news in my name that I ask you to vote for. I am not the one to choose who you will vote for, so stop this rubbish with my name and go and get your PVC and vote. I am not a politician,” the text that accompanies the video on Twitter reads. The claim that the former footballer has endorsed Tinubu is false.",31/01/2023,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/meta-programme-fact-checks/no-former-international-footballer-nwankwo-kanu-hasnt
"The photoshopped image seems an attempt to turn northern Muslim voters against Labour Party candidate Peter Obi. Not only is he  drinking beer – forbidden in Islam – but it’s Hero beer, which has a label that associates it with the southeastern Biafra separatist movement.",Fake,"An image circulating on social media appears to show Peter Obi, the Labour Party candidate in Nigeria’s upcoming presidential election, eating in a restaurant with two bottles of Hero beer on the table.  Obi is an Igbo from Nigeria’s southeast geopolitical zone and a leading candidate in the election, which is set for 25 February 2023. The image appeared online in late January. The Hero beer label has a symbol of a yellow rising sun and includes the colours red, green and black – making it similar to the flag of Biafra. The Republic of Biafra was created in 1967 when Nigeria’s largely Igbo southeastern region seceded from the rest of the country. A brutal 30-month civil war followed, which ended in 1970 with Biafra’s defeat. But a separatist movement continues to work for Biafra’s independence. A Facebook post with the image has the pidgin caption “Dey Play and flex with hero beer,” which means “Play and enjoy with Hero beer.” The post has been shared 199 times and has more than 10,000 comments.  The image has also been posted on Twitter by Adamu Garba, an influencer and vocal supporter of the Labour Party’s rival All Progressives Congress. Garba’s tweet reads: “Too much pleasure dey worry this wuna presidential aspirant. Double hero beer with Biafra trademark and isiewu full time.”  The word “wuna” is pidgin for “your”, and “isiewu” is Igbo for goat head, a reference to the goat-head pepper soup popular in Nigeria’s southeast zone. (But the three plates in the image actually hold amala, a yam flour meal popular in southwestern Nigeria, and not pepper soup.) Garba has more than 94,000 Twitter followers and the tweet has been viewed over 737,000 times.   Why is the image significant? The image seems to show that Obi, a Christian, drinks beer. Alcohol is forbidden under Islam, so it would cast him in a bad light for the many Muslim voters in northern Nigeria. In many parts of the north, the public sale and consumption of alcohol is prohibited by Sharia law.   And the Hero beer in the image associates Obi with the Biafran separatist movement, which is led by Ipob, the Indigenous People of Biafra. The Nigerian government has proscribed Ipob as a terrorist group.  Obi has refuted claims that he is linked to and supported by Ipob. Some northern leaders such as Rabiu Kwankwaso, the New Nigeria People’s Party presidential candidate, have said many northerners will not vote for Obi because of his association with Biafran separatism.  But does the image really show Obi enjoying a meal with two bottles of Hero beer? Image poorly doctored  There are obvious signs that the image is not original. Obi’s head and neck seem out of proportion to the rest of his body and don’t fit his posture. They’ve clearly been photoshopped onto the body of someone else. A Google reverse image search yielded multiple results from Twitter: a photo of a man eating amala on a date. To create the Obi image, the man’s head has been replaced with Obi’s, the colour of his T-shirt changed from orange to yellow, and the two bottles of an energy drink on the table replaced with bottles of Hero beer. The photo is fake. False and misleading information about election candidates have been circulating online for months now, and can only harm Nigerian voters’ ability to make informed choices.",30/01/2023,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/meta-programme-fact-checks/no-photo-nigerian-presidential-candidate-obi-drinking-hero
"There’s no evidence that a young Nigerian woman, whose studies were funded by presidential candidate Peter Obi, was the first black woman to perform a human heart transplant in under 30 minutes. A viral tweet is pure fabrication.",False,"If you believe a popular claim circulating on social media in January 2023, a 20-year-old Nigerian woman has become “the first black girl” to perform a human heart transplant “within 30 minutes”.  This remarkable claim first appeared in a now-deleted 7 January tweet, which in just a week received almost 19,000 likes and some 1.2 million views. Other versions of the claim surfaced in the following days here, here, here, here, here and here.  These posts claim that what led to the medical milestone was Nigerian presidential candidate Peter Obi sending the surgeon-to-be, “Chimaka”, to England on a scholarship.  The posts also include four photos: one of Obi, one of a woman in medical scrubs, one of a group of surgeons around an operating table, and one of what looks like a human heart connected to tubes.  Some users who came across the claim were unconvinced. In reply to the claim on social media, one user wrote: “Please be calming down with them lies.” Another simply asked: “Source??” But did a Nigerian named Chimaka become the first black woman to perform a heart transplant, in under 30 minutes, thanks to Peter Obi? And do the photos reflect this? We checked.   Photos don’t show what they claim to  An internet search revealed that the photo of surgeons standing around an operating table is from a 2022 world-first surgery. But it involved transplanting a pig heart into a human, performed by a team in the US state of Maryland. Similarly, as AFP has reported, the photo of the heart was taken years ago, and appears on various websites, including here and here, as well as on the Wikipedia page for heart transplantation, where it is listed as created in 2019.  A Twitter user quickly clarified the story behind the photo of the person wearing medical scrubs. Identifying herself as Wuraola, the user posted a link back to a 2020 tweet where she had posted pictures from the same photoshoot, and said they had all been taken “years ago in medical school”. The full photoshoot is available on a stock image website.  Waruola confirmed to AFP that the photos had been taken in 2019 in Ukraine. She is Nigerian but living in the United States. On Twitter, she clarified that she had “recently” completed an undergraduate degree at a Ukrainian university, funded by her parents. No scholarship, no ‘Chimaka’, no 30-minute heart transplant Obi, who appears in the first photo in the post, is a politician and candidate in Nigeria's upcoming 2023 presidential election.  As an AFP fact-check noted, Obi has in the past awarded scholarships to university students. But neither Africa Check nor other fact-checkers could find evidence of a scholarship given by Obi to someone called Chimaka who went on to become a surgeon.  According to the UK’s National Health Service and Mayo Clinic, a US-based medical centre, heart transplants are complex surgical procedures that take hours for teams of surgeons to perform, not just 30 minutes. Someone who recently obtained an undergraduate degree would not perform heart surgery.  According to records from Encyclopaedia.com, Dr Velma Scantlebury was the first black woman surgeon in the US to perform a transplant. But Africa Check could not find reliable sources for who was the first black woman surgeon to perform a heart transplant worldwide.",20/01/2023,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/meta-programme-fact-checks/no-evidence-young-nigerian-became-first-black-woman-perform
"As Nigeria’s elections near, politicians continue to be falsely quoted. One jarring statement attributed to governor Samuel Ortom is false.",False,"“I didn’t pay salaries because it is not good to be drunk on Christmas day,” reads a quote attributed to Samuel Ortom, the governor of Nigeria’s Benue state. It’s been circulating on Facebook since late December 2022. (See here, here, here, here, here, here and here.) Weeks later, the quote is still getting attention. Benue is in Nigeria’s north-central zone, but lies roughly in the country’s southeast, just touching the border of Cameroon. The state has an estimated 4.3 million people.  Ortom is set to leave office after the general elections that kick off in February. For months, Benue’s state-employed workers have complained about unpaid salaries. But did Ortom really say December salaries weren’t paid because the state wanted to stop its workers from drinking on Christmas Day?  No evidence of quote to be found There’s no detail in the quote about when and where the governor supposedly said it. There are no local reports of Ortom giving this reason for not paying workers. And the quote can’t be found on the Benue government’s official Twitter and Facebook pages. The quote could be seen as some kind of bad joke. But for unpaid workers, it’s not that funny.

Who five breakaway governors from Nigeria’s main opposition party support in the February 2023 presidential election will be closely watched. A claim on social media that they have given their conditions isn’t backed by evidence.,False,"A message circulating on Facebook lists 10 demands a group of five opposition governors have supposedly made if they are to support the ruling party’s candidate for the presidency of Nigeria.  Bola Tinubu is running to replace current president Muhammadu Buhari under the governing All Progressives Congress (APC) ticket. Nigeria’s elections are set to kick off on 25 February 2023. “BREAKING NEWS: G5 GOVS GAVE TINUBU 10 CONDITIONS TO JOIN HIM,” the message begins. The G5 are five opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) state governors who banded together after a fallout in the party. The APC took power from the PDP in 2015. The group is led by Nyesom Wike, the Rivers state governor. The message is supposedly “signed” by him. The other four are Oyo state governor Seyi Makinde, Samuel Ortom of Benue state, Okezie Ikpeazu of Abia and Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu.   Some of the 10 demands appear to be trivial – not what would be expected of prominent leaders. One is that Tinubu names his classmates and teachers in primary school.  This suggests the message is some kind of joke. But users’ responses suggest they believe the G5 really have made these demands. This could be because the demands are based on contentious talking points about Tinubu, including his age and health, where he attended school and his encounters with the law in the US. The message can also be seen here, here and here on Facebook. But did the G5 really make these 10 demands in return for their support of Tinubu’s presidential ambition? We checked.  No evidence, no news, no announcement The message doesn’t provide the source of the 10 conditions, or say when they were published. This lack of detail is often a red flag. If the five prominent governors had suggested they would support any of the four frontrunning candidates in the presidential race, it would have made national news in Nigeria. But there have been no media reports about it. A search of Wike’s official Twitter account and other social media pages returned no evidence that the G5 has issued the list of conditions.  Wike is expected to announce his preferred candidate some time in January. But no announcement had been made at the time of writing. The G5 are yet to openly declare their support for any candidate, or publicly share conditions for their support.",13/01/2023,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/meta-programme-fact-checks/nigerias-g5-opposition-governors-list-demands-support
"Outgoing president Muhammadu Buhari recently said Nigeria would see “overwhelming transformation” if his APC party’s candidate was elected as his successor. That’s at odds with a false quote attributed to the APC chairperson, doing the rounds on social media.",False,"“Peter Obi want to transform Nigeria to a ‘New Nigeria’, we don't need any transformation,” reads what appears to be a quote circulating on Facebook. The quote is attributed to “APC chairman”. That would be the national chair of the governing All Progressives Congress (APC), Abdullahi Adamu. Peter Obi, the Labour Party’s presidential candidate, is a strong contender in the February 2023 elections.

"Nigeria’s influential former president Olusegun Obasanjo has backed Peter Obi as his preferred presidential candidate in the upcoming elections. Now a false quote suggests the governing APC party wants to restrict media access in its northern stronghold, to limit any rise in Obi’s popularity.",False,"“Now that Obi endorsement is everywhere, we must deny people in the core north access to internet and radio,” reads what appears to be a quote doing the rounds on Facebook.  The quote is attributed to Festus Keyamo, spokesperson for Nigeria’s governing All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential campaign council. Peter Obi is the Labour Party’s presidential candidate in the country’s 2023 elections, which kick off on 25 February. It’s reported that Nigeria’s influential former president Olusegun Obasanjo endorsed Obi as his preferred candidate on 1 January. Other politicians then reportedly backed Obasanjo’s decision. The endorsement, from such a prominent figure, has attracted a lot of reaction from other presidential candidates and their supporters. The implication of the quote is that a news blackout in the north, seen as an APC stronghold, would limit any bump in popularity for Obi there due to the endorsement. It has also appeared on Facebook here, and here, But did Keyamo really say internet and radio access must be restricted in the north after Obasanjo’s endorsement of Obi?  No evidence for quote The Facebook posts don’t say where or when Keyamo supposedly made the statement. This is typical of false statements posted on social media.  A search of Keyamo’s verified Twitter account for the quote returned no result.  And it has not been reported by any credible local media.

By then, Obasanjo had already finished his military career. I respect him a lot, with his endorsement.” The tweet is from a Twitter account with the name “Ibrahim B. Babangida” and the handle @General_Ibbro. Ibrahim Babangida is a former military leader who was Nigeria’s head of state from 1985 to 1993. Olusegun Obasanjo was the country’s president from 1999 to 2007 and remains influential in its politics. On 1 January he endorsed Peter Obi of the Labour Party as his preferred choice for president in the country’s upcoming elections, set for 25 February.

He said the redesign was geared towards tackling problems linked to inflation, currency counterfeiting, insecurity, and other issues.  Emefiele said Nigerians had till 31 January 2023 to exchange their old naira notes for the new notes. Following the redesign, the CBN introduced new cash withdrawal limits.

No evidence of quote Facebook posts with the quote don’t say when and where Smith made the statement. This lack of detail is often a sign that we should not take a social media claim at face value – there’s a good chance it’s false.

Nigeria’s governing party’s Muslim-Muslim presidential election ticket for 2023 has been much debated. But the wife of the All Progressives Congress’s presidential hopeful did not promise her Muslim husband would ensure a Christian-Christian presidency after he serves for two terms.,MContext,"A post shared on Facebook in Nigeria attributes a quote to Oluremi Tinubu, the wife of the ruling party presidential candidate, Bola Ahmed Tinubu.  The west African country votes in general elections in February 2023.  Oluremi Tinubu is a third-time senator representing the Lagos central district. She is also a former first lady of Lagos state, her husband having been governor from 1999 to 2007. The quote reads: “Tinubu will give Nigeria Christian/Christian presidency after 8yrs rule. – Remi Tinubu”. Incumbent president Muhammadu Buhari is a northern Muslim elected on an All Progressives Congress (APC) ticket in 2015. He has been in office for two terms of four years each and cannot constitutionally run for another term. He succeeded Goodluck Jonathan, a Christian from the south. Power in Nigeria has usually been rotated between the north, dominated by Muslims, and the south, dominated by Christians. This is thought to have influenced the emergence of Tinubu, a southerner, as the APC’s presidential candidate for 2023. But Tinubu is Muslim.  His religion is therefore controversial, only becoming more so when he chose another Muslim as running mate, Kashim Shettima from the north. The quote circulating on social media suggests Tinubu has promised he will ensure power passes on to a Christian, after he has governed for two terms. The same claim appeared on Facebook here, here and here But did Oluremi Tinubu really say her husband had made this promise?  Quoted out-of-context  A search led us to a video where Oluremi Tinubu addressed a rally in the city of Lagos in southern Nigeria.   Here she said the APC Muslim-Muslim ticket “will set the tone for the future because sometime very soon you will see a Christian-Christian ticket”. But Tinubu did not claim her husband was promising this. The Facebook posts doing the rounds quoted her out of context.",22/12/2022,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/meta-programme-fact-checks/no-nigerian-presidential-candidates-wife-oluremi-tinubu
"We’ve said it before and we’ll say it again: when something sounds too good to be true, it usually is. That’s also the case for “774,000 empowerment opportunities” being advertised on social media across Africa.",Scam,"A website claiming to offer funds through a “presidential youth empowerment scheme” is getting attention on Facebook and WhatsApp in a number of countries. “The P-YES is aiming to create at least 774,000 empowerment opportunities through direct youth empowerment over a period of two years. Applicants are to fill the form below and click on Apply,” reads the text on the site. The site’s homepage is headed “Presidential Youth Empowerment Fund”. It shows the flags and coats of arms of countries such as Nigeria, Uganda, Ghana, India, Kenya and South Africa. The site features an “application form” that asks for personal details such as name, phone number, country of residence and region. It also asks if the applicant has applied before. The amateurish site – today.empower-online.xyz – has been posted on public groups with thousands of members in Kenya, Rwanda and Namibia. The Presidential Youth Empowerment Scheme or P-YES is a Nigerian public-private partnership run by the office of the president’s special assistant on youth and students’ affairs. But is this website and information related to the partnership? We checked.  Usual engagement bait It’s unlikely that legitimate government funds would be advertised on a badly designed website with poorly written text. The website is also suspiciously similar to a site we debunked in October 2022, also for a fake “Youth Empowerment Scheme”.  After viewing this site, we deliberately left the first and second page of the supposed application forms blank and just clicked “APPLY NOW”. Suspiciously, this allowed us to proceed to the last page where we were still congratulated for being approved to receive the funds. The form then asked us to share the link “with 15 friends or 5 groups on WhatsApp” as the only way for the application to be valid. This is simply engagement bait. These are usually social media posts that ask people to interact by liking, commenting or sharing. It increases the post’s reach but offers no reward. This may also be an attempt to steal valuable personal information. Africa Check has uncovered plenty like this before, tempting desperate job seekers and students.

"Bola Tinubu, the governing All Progressives Congress presidential candidate, asked members of his team to answer audience questions after his speech at the influential UK thinktank. But there’s no evidence that a Chatham House analyst criticised him for this.",False,"A screenshot doing the rounds on Facebook claims that a Chatham House analyst described Nigerian presidential hopeful Bola Tinubu’s recent appearance at the thinktank as “very absurd and a red flag”. Error-riddled text on the screenshot reads: “The Political Affrairs Analyst of Chatham House was interviewed last night and he said for the first time in his career, he saw a situation where a presidential aspirant who should be selling himself to his country and the world, distributed simple questions to people to answer on his behalf. He described the senerio as very absurd and a red flag.” Chatham House is an influential British thinktank able to attract high-profile speakers. It hosted both frontrunners in Kenya’s presidential election race in March 2022.  Tinubu is standing on the ticket of the governing All Progressives Congress to succeed president Muhammadu Buhari in Nigeria’s upcoming elections, set for February 2023. The screenshot began to circulate after Tinubu made an appearance at Chatham House in December 2022 to discuss his plans should he become president.  His absence from town hall meetings organised by local media has stirred mixed reactions from the public. Tinubu has said the organisers only want to “make money” off him. But during questions after his speech at Chatham House he called on members of his entourage to respond instead. This raised more eyebrows, including at the event.  The screenshot can be seen on Facebook here, here , here, here and here. But did a Chatham House analyst really say this?  Statement can’t be found The screenshot gives no details for the statement, such as the name of the analyst or when and where they supposedly said it. This lack of detail is common with disinformation. The statement can’t be found on the Chatham House website or the thinktank’s Twitter account. And there have been no reports in credible local and international media of a Chatham House analyst making the statement after Tinubu’s appearance. If such a statement had been made, it would have been in the news, given the thinktank’s international visibility. There is no public evidence that a Chatham House analyst described Tinubu’s speech as “very absurd and a red flag”.",12/12/2022,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/meta-programme-fact-checks/no-evidence-chatham-house-analyst-called-nigerian
"A claim about a large amount of cash found in a London flat has resurfaced on social media, after first gaining traction years ago.

The post reads: “BREAKING … UK Police Discovers $ 8.5 Million dollars In Pastor Osibanjo's Brother's House Who Is Schooling In London University!” We found the same claim on Facebook here, here, here, here and here. But is there any evidence that this story is true? We checked.  No evidence for any details Yemi Osinbajo is Nigeria’s vice president. He is also a pastor. His surname is “Osinbajo”, not “Osibanjo” as in the Facebook posts. The Facebook post gives no details, such as the name of the person meant to be Osinbajo’s brother or where in the UK the house is. This lack of detail is often an indication that a Facebook post is false. There have also been no reports like this in either local or international media, which we would expect if it were true. Original story from 2014 In 2018, a Nigerian blog claimed that US$8.5 million was found in a UK flat belonging to a relative of Osinbajo. But there was no evidence to support it. The original story was first reported by UK media organisations the BBC and Daily Mail in 2014, a year before Osinbajo became vice president. According to these media reports, the money was found in a flat in the UK capital London. It reportedly belonged to a 29-year-old man whose identity was not disclosed – and no mention was made of him being Nigerian.

"Did Nigerian presidential candidate Bola Tinubu meet US president Joe Biden in the White House in late November 2022? No, the claim is based on a badly doctored photo.",Fake,"An image of Bola Tinubu, the presidential candidate for Nigeria’s governing All Progressives Congress, sitting with US president Joe Biden has gone viral on Twitter and Facebook.  A Twitter user pointed us to a tweet with the image and asked Africa Check to verify it. The tweet claims it shows Tinubu meeting Biden on 29 November 2022.  “Happening now: @officialABAT on a courtesy visit to US President Joe Biden as part of his US on international engagements. Obidiots say Tinubu cannot visit US based on his indictment. He is there right now live with the US President. Let your Obi visit too. Mumu pipo,” the tweet reads.  “Obidiots” is an insulting name given to supporters of Peter Obi, the Labour Party’s presidential candidate. “Mumu pipo” is pidgin for “stupid people”. Nigeria is set to hold general elections, including for the president, in early 2023. Tinubu and Obi are among the leading candidates for the top job. The image has also appeared on Facebook here, here, here, here, and here. Tinubu’s candidacy has stirred many controversies, including his alleged involvement in a drug trafficking and money laundering case in the US back in 1993.  His campaign has denied this. But did Tinubu meet Biden in the White House?  Manipulated photo In verifying the viral image, we saw some telltale signs that it had been doctored. There are significant variations in picture quality, with the part around Tinubu and the man sitting next to him looking blurry. Objects behind Tinubu have their edges rough and overlapping in a way that is unnatural.    This is a red flag because photos of visits to the White House, the official residence of US presidents in Washington DC, are always of good quality. Professional photographers are used for all official engagements.    A reverse image search led to several media reports that indicated the original photo came from a 26 July 2021 meeting between Iraqi prime minister Mustafa Al-Kadhimi and Biden in the president’s White House oval office.  Tinubu’s campaign debunks the claim The APC’s presidential campaign council has debunked the claim that Tinubu met with Biden.  A statement by Bayo Onanuga, the council’s director of media and publicity, blamed opposition parties for the misinformation. At the time the image was supposedly snapped, he said, Tinubu was in Abuja, Nigeria’s capital.  “A viral photograph showing Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu and United State President, Joe Biden in talks at the White House is the latest in the series of misinformation being dished out by the political opposition,” the statement reads.  “We cannot just fathom the purpose of the mischief and the falsehood, which emanated from the rabid followers of Peter Obi. The apparently photo-shopped image surfaced Tuesday night, on the heels of news that Asiwaju Tinubu will embark on a foreign trip this weekend.”",02/12/2022,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/meta-programme-fact-checks/no-image-doesnt-show-nigerian-presidential-hopeful-tinubu
"After Labour Party presidential candidate Peter Obi didn’t meet governorship candidate Beatrice Itubo during a visit to Rivers state, the rumour mill got working. But Itubo was reportedly ill at the time, and there’s no evidence that she’ll now be “mobilising party members” against Obi.",False,"A message circulating on Facebook claims that Beatrice Itubo, the Labour Party governorship candidate for southern Nigeria’s Rivers State, has vowed to work against Peter Obi, her party’s presidential candidate. Nigeria is set to hold general elections in early 2023. “I will mobilize labour party members in Rivers state against Mr Peter Obi. - Comr Beatrice Itubo, Labour Party's Governorship Candidate, Rivers State,” one of the posts reads. It includes Itubo’s photo. The claim has appeared in dozens of posts on Facebook and Instagram. See some examples here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here and here. The claim began to circulate after Obi, one of the frontrunners in the presidential race, was accused of refusing to visit Itubo when he visited Rivers state. Current Rivers state governor Nyesom Wike, a member of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), invited Obi to inaugurate the newly built Nkpolu-Oroworokwo flyover on 17 November 2022. Critics berated Obi for not visiting Itubo while he was in Rivers state. Itubo was said to be ill at the time. Obi apologised to Itubo in a tweet thread and referred to it as “an inadvertent oversight” and said he “was not informed or aware of her sickness”.  Accusation of trading governorship for presidency Obi was also accused of trading the party’s chance of winning the state’s governorship election in exchange for Wike’s support of his presidential bid. Wike had appealed to Obi to tell his supporters that the Labour Party stands no chance of defeating the PDP in the governorship election in Rivers state and pledged to support Obi’s presidential campaign. Obi apparently accepted the offer when he said: “You [Wike] know you are in charge. We will not quarrel with you; anybody who quarrels with you doesn’t know what he is doing. I will not try it. I am begging, give us federal and we will give you the state.” But did Itubo vow to get members of the party to work against Obi? Itubo’s reaction does not support the claim The various posts provide no details about where and when Itubo said she would oppose Obi in Rivers state. This lack of detail is a red flag. The Nigerian media have reported the most recent developments related to Obi’s candidacy, including his apology to Itubo. But no credible media organisation has reported that Itubo plans to oppose Obi. In her public reaction, Itubo downplayed claims that Obi had traded her governorship bid and would no longer support her ahead of the governorship election. A statement by Asim Adams, spokesperson for the Beatrice Itubo Campaign Council, published on Itubo’s Facebook page on 17 November 2022, said Obi spoke in metaphor and analogies in responding to Wike’s offer. “Unfortunately, these metaphors and analogies have been taken by some from the way they interpreted it to mean His Excellency Peter Gregory Obi has abandoned project Beatrice Itubo and other candidates for the forthcoming elections ... far from it,” the statement reads. “Be rest assured that he never meant more than what he stated as we have firmly confirmed from good source and authority that it was a mere statement which never resonated beyond where it was made in the atmosphere of conviviality...and any interpretation of sort or misgivings should be discountenanced.” And there’s no evidence on Itubo’s Twitter timeline that she is now opposed to Obi. She also told journalists that Obi’s speech was a political statement. She added that “the Obi that I know is wiser than that”. The claim is not supported by any evidence.",30/11/2022,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/meta-programme-fact-checks/no-evidence-nigerian-labour-party-governorship-candidate
"A video of a Spanish artist’s sculpture – what seem to be massive stashes of cash, but are in fact hand-painted resin – has been used in allegations of corruption against politicians in at least three countries.",False,"Earlier in November 2022, Africa Check and the Nigerian Fact-checkers’ Coalition debunked a claim, posted on the job networking site LinkedIn, that a video showed huge piles of money stashed in a Nigerian politician’s home. The politician named in the claim is senator Orji Uzor Kalu. He’s a former governor of Abia state in Nigeria’s southeastern geopolitical zone. He’s also the governing All Progressives Congress’s chief whip in the country’s senate, where he represents the district of Abia North. We found that the video of cash in fact showed a sculpture created by the Spanish artist Alejandro Monge back in 2019. But the video is also circulating on Facebook with a slightly different claim: that the cash was stashed by one Theodore Orji. Orji Uzor Kalu and Theodore Orji are not the same person. “Found, in Theodore Orji's house, former Governor, Abia State. All in foreign currency. Go verify,” reads one caption to the video. Another is longer: “Theodore Orji, the former governor of Abia state, now a serving senator, the man talking in igbo said.. ‘How will they give him these kind of assignments to evacuate this money in this mid night and to where, these money are in dollars, pounds and euroes, no factory, no hospital, no bore hole for community where these money was hidden, just keep the money, he said the money is almost rotten by moisture and heat.’ God dey.” Yet another doesn’t name any Orji, but uses the video to make similar allegations of corruption against Nigerian governors.  European Dream Theodore Ahamefule Orji was the governor of Abia state from 2007 to 2015. He’s currently the senator for Abia Central. He has also served as chief of staff to Orji Uzor Kalu. In 2021, Orji was arrested with his sons Chinedu and Ogbonna for “alleged misappropriation of public funds and money laundering”, according to Nigeria’s Premium Times. “The ex-governor was alleged to have received N500 million monthly as security vote for eight years as governor of Abia between 2007 and 2015,” the newspaper says. But the video is not evidence of Orji’s alleged crimes. It simply shows a sculpture titled European Dream. The video has also been used to accuse politicians of corruption in Cameroon and Russia. Again, it’s no evidence of any crime.",25/11/2022,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/meta-programme-fact-checks/piles-money-facebook-video-shows-sculpture-not-evidence
"Piles and piles and piles of cash stacked up in an otherwise empty room. The video has been used to accuse politicians of corruption in Cameroon, Russia – and now Nigeria. But the clip actually shows a sculpture by a Spanish artist, each bill made of hand-painted resin.",False,"A November 2022 post on the professional networking site LinkedIn claims that a video of what looks like massive piles of cash, some of it burned, was taken in a room in the house of Nigerian senator Orji Uzor Kalu.  Kalu is a former governor of Abia state in Nigeria’s southeastern geopolitical zone. He’s the governing All Progressives Congress’s chief whip in the senate, where he represents the district of Abia North. In December 2019 Kalu was sentenced to 12 years in prison for fraud. But he was released in June 2020 after a supreme court ruling. “EFCC needs to go after @Orji Uzo Kalu, former governor of Abia state,” the LinkedIn post reads. “Look at how he starched [sic] European currency in his house.” It has attracted dozens of comments – some agreeing but others calling it “fake news”.  The EFCC is the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, a state agency that investigates economic crimes in Nigeria.  Other comments referred to a Central Bank of Nigeria plan to redesign naira banknotes, the country’s currency. The news has led to banks getting cash deposits worth N52 billion in two weeks.    2019 video also used against Cameroonian and Russian politicians  The Nigerian Fact-Checkers Coalition, which brings together fact-checkers and media houses, analysed the video using the InVid video verification tool. We found that the clip has been doing the rounds on the internet for a while, with several different descriptions of what it shows. In 2019 the video appeared online in the Central African country of Cameroon.  It was used to claim that either Cameroon’s current minister of defence, or a former defence minister, was hiding the money in his house and that his wife had tried to burn it before police discovered it. Only former minister Edgar Alain Mebe Ngo’o was named in the claims. At the time, he was suspected of embezzlement. The video also made headlines in Russia that year. This time the claim was that Rauf Arashukov, a Russian senator, had quietly tried to burn money he had corruptly stolen and stashed in his office. Arashukov had at the time been arrested on suspicion of two murders.  But neither of these claims are true. Art used for disinformation The video actually shows a 2019 work by Alejandro Monge, a Spanish artist.  The stacks of cash are in fact part of a sculpture, with each banknote made of resin and entirely hand-painted. The sculpture is titled European Dream. The artwork has been displayed in the 3 Punts Gallery in Spain’s eastern city of Barcelona and in galleries in Madrid, the country’s capital. In February 2019, Monge posted the video used in false claims on his Instagram page, to debunk the claims. The post, in Spanish, stresses Monge’s conviction that people should question what they see on the internet before they believe.  A translation of the post reads: “Monge_art: It’s what the internet has that something is not known because it goes viral ... and then no one knows what it is or to whom it belongs ... thank you for sending me where you are going to see them from New York to WhatsApp groups all over the world … well if people knew it’s a sculpture and the notes are hand-painted… @monge_art.” In March 2019, Monge told France24 that he was conflicted about how his art was misused on social media. “When I saw that my installation had been misappropriated in Russia, I had mixed feelings about it,” he said.  “At first, I laughed a lot and was flattered that my sculpture could fool so many people, which meant it was really realistic. But then I started to get a bit afraid because it was connected with a scandal in Russia, and I didn’t want to be associated with that in any way.” He added: “My installation is a commentary on modern society and how everything revolves around money. I believe that money is the god of contemporary society.” Monge clarified that the cash in the video was not real but, instead, hand painted.  “My sculpture is made up of about 500,000 hand-painted fake bills made out of resin,” he said.  The video does not show real money stashed in a room in a Nigerian senator’s house. The claim is false.

The death of three-year-old Ifeanyi Adeleke on 31 October 2022 has been widely covered by the media, with fans, public figures and entertainers expressing condolences to Davido and his fiancé Chioma Rowland. According to reports, the child drowned in a pool at the family’s home in the upmarket Banana Island area of Lagos city in southwestern Nigeria. The police are investigating the death.  The video shows a boy with a blue inflatable swimming ring around his waist. The boy gets into a small pool and soon after appears to drown. The caption to the video reads: “CCTV footage showing the moment Davido’s son drowned in the baby pool. So sad …” The video has also been posted here, here, here and here, along with captions suggesting that it shows the three-year-old Ifeanyi. But does it?   CCTV footage dates back to 2019 The CCTV footage shows a timestamp that reads: “2019-08-23 15:13:57.” Going by this, this footage shows a child in distress on 23 August 2019, more than three years before the video was being shared widely on social media. The child in the video cannot be Davido’s son. There is also some Chinese text on the video. This gave us a hint that the CCTV video could have been from China. A Google reverse search of the video led us to an article published on 30 August 2019 on the website of the Mirror, a national tabloid newspaper in the UK.

But there is no evidence Sowore has said anything like it.",False,"A Facebook post circulating in Nigeria quotes Omoyele Sowore, the presidential candidate of the African Action Congress (AAC), as saying “I Will Jail Buhari When I Become President In 2023”.   Sowore is a Nigerian human rights activist, pro-democracy campaigner, and founder of online news agency Sahara Reporters.  In the 2019 presidential elections Sowore, on the AAC ticket, went up against president Muhammadu Buhari. But he secured only 33,953 votes out of 28,614,190 total votes cast, while Buhari won with 15,191,847 votes. In August 2019 Sowore was arrested and detained for convening the #RevolutionNow protest. He was charged with treasonable felony before being released on 24 December. The Nigerian government also charged Sowore for conspiracy to commit treason and insulting Buhari in an interview.  The 5 September 2022 claim, quoting Sowore saying he would jail Buhari, was also repeated in other Facebook posts. But did Sowore say this, potentially risking his own rearrest? We checked.  No evidence of quote The original post didn’t give details of where or when Sowore was meant to have made the comment. This is suspicious and often a sign that a claim circulating on social media has been made up.

But there is no evidence he’s come out in support of Obi, or any other leading candidate.",False,"A Facebook post claims Nigerian actor Pete Edochie has said he is supporting Peter Obi, the presidential candidate for the Labour Party, in Nigeria’s 2023 elections.  The post includes a photo of the Nollywood veteran, with the quote: “Only INEC can stop Peter Obi from becoming Nigeria's next president come 2023.” The Independent National Electoral Commission, or Inec, is in charge of organising elections in Nigeria. Edochie has been reported to be close to several political figures and is vocal about his views on political matters. In August 2022, he said that Nigeria needed an Igbo leader, in reaction to news that Bola Tinubu would run on the ruling All Progressives Congress ticket in the 2023 elections. Tinubu is from the Yoruba community, while Edochie is himself Igbo. In February 2021 Edochie endorsed his actor son Yul Edochie for the 2023 presidential election, but hasn’t since then publicly endorsed anyone. The 30 September 2022 claim that he has said he supports Obi was repeated in other Facebook posts. Edochie and Obi are both from Anambra, in southeastern Nigeria. Could this be why Edochie has come out in support of Obi?   No evidence Edochie said such The original post didn’t give details of where or when Edochie was meant to have made the comment. There have been no reports in the mainstream media of Edochie saying anything related to Obi winning the 2023 presidential elections.  Such a statement would have been reported by credible news organisations, since Edochie is a well-known figure in Nollywood. We also found no comment like it on Edochie’s verified Instagram account.

A screenshot shared on social media in Nigeria appears to show a prominent politician giving Nigerians “the finger”. But Festus Keyamo wasn’t deliberately being rude in the televised interview. The APC spokesperson was listing items on the fingers of his hand and the screenshot caught him at the moment he extended his middle finger.,Misleading,"A screenshot showing the presidential campaign spokesperson for Nigeria’s ruling party, the All Progressives Congress (APC), was posted on Facebook and Twitter, with a caption that claims he was “giving Nigerians the middle finger on national TV”, Festus Keyamo was appearing on popular Nigerian TV channel, Channels TV. He is Nigeria’s junior minister for labour and employment, as well as the APC campaign spokesperson. The caption to the photo, where Keyamo appears to have the middle finger of his left hand extended, reads: “Are you surprised that Tinubu told Nigerians to ‘shurrup’ on national TV? This is his spokesperson, giving Nigerians the middle finger on national TV.” Bola Ahmed Tinubu is the presidential candidate for the APC in the 2023 presidential elections.  Tinubu spoke at the inauguration of the women’s arm of the APC campaign team in the Nigerian capital Abuja on 10 October.  At one point in his speech, he told the women delegates that if people said they wanted a change of government – away from the ruling APC – then the women should tell the naysayers “shut up your mouth”.  This appears to be the incident referenced in the claim as “shurrup”. But did the APC campaign spokesperson rudely give Nigerians the middle finger? We checked.  Keyamo was only listing items on his hand We traced the screenshot’s origin to a YouTube video posted by Channels TV, where Keyamo was answering questions about Tinubu’s campaign. The video was posted on 26 September 2022, two days before election campaigning officially kicked off in Nigeria. The screenshot was taken 13 minutes and 52 seconds into the video, where Keyamo was listing what he claimed Tinubu and the APC wanted Nigerians to know. He started counting on his middle finger. He was not insulting Nigerians by giving them the middle finger, at least not deliberately, as claimed in the social media post. Since election campaigning began in Nigeria, supporters have taken to social media to show their support for certain candidates and to discredit their opponents.

The central bank has distanced itself from all of the pages, warning Nigerians of scams.",False,"Several Facebook pages have been created claiming to help Nigerians with their investments. The pages have one thing in common – they all use the name of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). The names of the pages vary from CBN Investment Platform and Nigeria CBN Helping Hand Investment Platform to CBN Helping Hand Trading Investment and CBN Helping Hand Trading Platform. One August 2022 post reads: “Nigeria Central Bank Helping Hand Investment is a financial support to all Nigerian citizens. It's a place where you invest your money between two to three hours you also get your double income of what you invest but you can only invest once in a day.” Another post claims “CBN Investment” is a network marketing business that will double your investment within “one hour to 45 minutes” and calls itself “a panacea for job creation and poverty alleviation”. But are any of these a scheme of Nigeria’s central bank?  ‘We have no affiliation with such online schemes’ Central banks across the world help their governments maintain economic and financial stability.  Their functions include issuing currencies, acting as the government’s banker and as the custodian of cash reserves belonging to commercial banks. In a statement posted on their social media page, the Central Bank of Nigeria said it is not affiliated to any of the Facebook pages offering too-good-to-be-true investment opportunities. “The Central Bank of Nigeria wishes to dissociate itself from online schemes such as CBN Helping Hands Investment Programme purporting to be the bank's representative,” the bank’s statement read. “Members of the public are therefore advised not to have any dealings with such unauthorised groups as they are not acting on behalf of the CBN.""",28/09/2022,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/meta-programme-fact-checks/beware-scam-nigerias-central-bank-does-not-have-investment
"An online rumour is that Tokunbo Awolowo-Dosumu, daughter of Nigerian independence statesman Obafemi Awolowo, said there was a plot to oust Bola Tinubu and make Hashim Shettima president if the All Progressives Congress won the presidency. But she has dismissed the rumour as “false, mischievous and wicked”.",False,"Nigeria is set to choose a new president in months, with elections slated for early 2023. One of the leading candidates is Bola Tinubu of the governing All Progressives Congress. In July 2022, Tinubu announced that Kashim Shettima, the former governor of Borno state, would be his running mate – and therefore the APC’s vice-presidential candidate. But in September, a rumour started circulating online that there was a plot to oust Tinubu if he won the presidency, and make Shettima president instead. It claims the plot was revealed by Tokunbo Awolowo-Dosumu, Nigeria’s former ambassador to the Netherlands, executive director of the Obafemi Awolowo Foundation and chair of African Newspapers of Nigeria Plc.  Awolowo-Dosumu is the daughter of the late statesman Obafemi Awolowo, who played a key role in the country’s independence movement. “Tokunbo Awolowo-Dosunmu, the daughter of Nigerian nationalist and statesman, Obafemi Awolowo has alleged of plot to get rid of Bola Tinubu, the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate if he wins the 2023 election,” a typical version of the rumour reads, on Facebook. “She alleged that there was a plot to get rid of Tinubu and install his running mate, Kashim Shettima as President,” it adds. “She said those behind the plot would take advantage of Tinubu’s medical condition.” But did Awolowo-Dosunmu really make this claim? We checked.  ‘A matter I know nothing about’ The rumour isn’t backed by any details, such as when and where Awolowo-Dosumu was supposed to have revealed the plot. This kind of vagueness is common with false information. And while it has appeared on blogs, her supposed allegation hasn’t been reported by any credible media outlets. Given the former ambassador’s high profile, such a claim would have made national news. And in a statement issued on 7 September and reported in several major newspapers, Awolowo-Dosumu dismissed the rumour as “false, mischievous and wicked”. “I am not in partisan politics and I have not been in partisan politics for decades. I have neither endorsed nor condemned any candidate or party. I have no intention to do so,” she said. “I refuse to be dragged into a matter I know nothing about. I advise whoever is behind this wicked lie to make better use of their time for the progress and development of our country, Nigeria.” As Nigeria’s 2023 elections approach, Africa Check is seeing an increasing number of false online claims about key political figures.

"As reports emerged that presidential hopeful Peter Obi was drumming up support among Nigerians abroad, social media quoted attorney general Abubakar Malami as saying anyone in the diaspora who contributed to the Labour Party candidate’s campaign would be arrested. But there is no evidence that the AG said this.",False,"“Any Nigerian who lives abroad, funding the campaign of Peter Obi shall be arrested. It is against our electoral laws,” reads a quote attributed to Abubakar Malami that’s doing the rounds on Facebook in September 2022. Malami is Nigeria’s attorney general and minister of justice. Obi is the Labour Party’s presidential candidate for the upcoming elections, set for early 2023. Under the country’s constitution, it’s illegal for political parties to “retain any funds or assets remitted or sent to it from outside Nigeria”. And the 2022 electoral law limits election expenses, and the nature and amount of contributions made to political parties. In early September it was reported that Obi was “currently making moves to raise funds from Nigerians in the diaspora”. The quote has also appeared on Twitter, on a popular discussion forum, and on several blogs. But did Malami really say any Nigerians living abroad would be prosecuted if they funded Obi? We checked.  No news reports, no evidence on social media No context is given for the quote, such as when and where Malami said it. This lack of detail is often a sign of false information. Such a statement about a leading presidential candidate by the attorney general of Nigeria would have been in the headlines. But no credible local or foreign news outlets have reported the statement. A search of Malami’s verified Facebook account, and the justice ministry’s website and Twitter feed, returned no evidence of the statement.

"A member of the house of representatives is expected to have not more than N70 million to conduct his election, logistics and other things, by law.",Incorrect,"Doguwa claimed that Nigeria’s electoral law limits the election expenses of political office holders.  He said a member of the house of representatives, for example, is not expected to have more than N70 million (US$150,000) for election expenses, including campaign logistics and polling unit agents’ pay. Does the law really say this?   The law Doguwa referred to is section 88 of the Electoral Act 2022, which sets limits on election expenses. It states that the maximum a candidate seeking a seat in the house of representatives can spend on election expenses is N70 million. For the senate, the maximum is N100 million (about $220,000).  Nigeria’s two-chambered national assembly is made up of the house and the senate. The N70 million limit Doguwa referred to applies to all candidates campaigning for a seat in the house of representatives – not only those who already hold office and are seeking re-election.  Therefore we rate this claim incorrect.",23/02/2023,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/federal-legislator-misleads-about-law-and-nigerian-politicians-campaign-cash
The law has provided the amount of money we need to oversee our election process.,Misleading,"Doguwa said the central bank’s new policy was preventing him from being able to spend the amount a house of representatives candidate was allowed for election expenses.  “The law has provided the amount of money we need to oversee our election process,” he said. “If the central bank fails to make available this money we need to fund our elections, definitely every candidate no matter what party he belongs to will be put at disadvantage.”  We found that neither section 88 nor any other part of the electoral law sets out the amount of money candidates must spend on campaigns or other expenses associated with getting elected.     The purpose of this section of the Electoral Act is to limit the costs a candidate can incur in the process of getting elected. It doesn’t dictate how much a candidate needs. That’s what Bashir Ibrahim, a professor of law at Ahmadu Bello University in Zaria, northwest Nigeria, told Africa Check. “It is false and misleading to claim that the law says you should have that amount. The law envisages that anyone running for office will incur costs in the process. To check the influence of money on elections, the law puts a cap, a limit on how much a candidate can spend on elections,” Ibrahim said. It's not about what you spend “Winning elections is not about how much you spend. A candidate can spend far less than half of the expense limit and still win.” Ibrahim said candidates’ main election expenses were advertising, media publicity, organising campaign rallies and meetings, and paying polling agents on election day. “The law implies that a house of representatives candidate does not need to spend up to N70 million to accomplish all that,” Ibrahim said. Kamilu Fage, a political science professor at the Bayero University in Kano, northwest Nigeria, agreed. He said it was “wrong and misleading” for a house of representatives candidate to claim they must spend N70 million. “The limit set by the Electoral Act covers all expenses incurred during the campaign and on election day. This may include the amount they spent buying their party nomination form,” Fage told Africa Check. According to him, N70 million was perhaps “too much for someone seeking to win a seat in the house of representatives. When you compare it with the official remuneration of a member of the house, you will see that allowing a candidate to spend that much encourages corruption.""",23/02/2023,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/federal-legislator-misleads-about-law-and-nigerian-politicians-campaign-cash
The law allows me to have the N70 million in cash.,Incorrect,"No part of the Electoral Act states that election candidates must have N70 million in ready cash. “To say a house of representatives candidate needs the N70 million expense limit in cash is absolutely wrong,” Fage said. “Either the person is ignorant of the law, which is no excuse, or he is deliberately and intentionally distorting the law and misleading the public. Those who aspire to be leaders should be the first to obey the law.” He added: “The reason politicians are revolting against the naira redesign and withdrawal limit is that they need amounts in cash to woo voters and influence electoral officials and security agents. These are not allowed by law.”   Ahmadu Bello University’s Ibrahim said Nigerian politicians were also being made uncomfortable by the introduction of the bimodal voter accreditation system (BVAS).  The system verifies the biometrics of voters, such as fingerprints and facial features.  “They are now relying on vote-buying and inducing electoral officials and security agents. They need a lot of cash to do this. That is why a candidate will say he is at a disadvantage because he does not have millions of naira in cash,” Ibrahim said. Fage said legally allowing candidates to handle large sums in cash risked the violation of the law against money laundering. Nigeria’s money laundering law says: “No person or body corporate shall, except in a transaction through a financial institution, make or accept cash payment of a sum exceeding— N5,000,000 or its equivalent, in the case of an individual; or  N10,000,000 or its equivalent, in the case of a body corporate.”",23/02/2023,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/federal-legislator-misleads-about-law-and-nigerian-politicians-campaign-cash
A presidential candidate needs to have N1 billion.,Incorrect,"To buttress his point, Doguwa added that a presidential candidate must, by law, have N1 billion (about $2.2 million) for campaign and election expenses.  This claim also falls short. The Electoral Act does not say that a presidential candidate needs any amount of money for an election. It only sets a maximum limit of N5 billion (about $10.9 million, and not N1 billion) for election expenses. It provides for a fine or imprisonment if a candidate knowingly contravenes this provision.

He was referring to the first phase of the Lagos rail mass transit blue line, which president Muhammadu Buhari launched a few days before the debate.  The line is one of six in the Lagos transport master plan. When complete, it should be 27 kilometres long. But the first phase is 13 km long, not 16 km. Rhodes-Vivour also overstated the construction time. A Chinese company started work in July 2010 and completed the first phase in December 2022.

Lagos does not have a wetland protection policy.,Mostly correct,"Rhodes-Vivour also blamed constant flooding in Lagos on the state government’s mismanagement of wetlands. He claimed the state did not have a policy to protect wetlands. Wetlands are ecosystems where water is the main factor controlling the environment. They include lakes, rivers, swamps and coral groves. Nigeria is a signatory to a UN treaty on the conservation and use of wetlands.  There is evidence that the state government has drafted a wetlands policy. But this has not been made law.

Lagos has 2 million out-of-school children.,Incorrect,"The claim that 2 million children in Lagos don’t attend school was frequently repeated during the debate.  Oladokun, the moderator, and the candidates Rhodes-Vivour and Abdul-Azeez Adediran all said it. State officials have also made the claim. But is this true? Not according to the available data. The most recent estimate by Unesco, the UN’s education and culture agency, is that 20 million children across Nigeria are out of school. The data comes from the federal ministry of education, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) and others.   So if Lagos, one of 36 states, has 2 million out-of-school children, it would account for 10% of the national total.  This was not possible, Oriyomi Ogunwale told Africa Check. He is the project lead at Eduplana, a Nigerian organisation that focuses on education.  “Lagos is not among the states with the highest number of out-of-school children in the country. Even northern states like Bauchi, Sokoto, Kano, or Kebbi with some of the highest rates do not have up to 2 million.”  Politicians often trotted out unsupported numbers, Ogunwale said. But part of the problem was that Lagos state rarely published data. “It is not easy to look up Lagos state data on education and other areas.” Lagos one of four states with lowest out-of-school rates  In late 2022, the NBS published its first multidimensional poverty index. This found that 28.7% of children aged six to 15 were out of school, across Nigeria. This is about 16.2 million children, based on the estimate of 56.3 million children in that age range. The northern state of Kebbi had the highest rate of out-of school children, at 67.6%. It was followed by Sokoto (66.4%), Yobe (62.9%) and Zamfara at 61.3%.",08/02/2023,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/lagosrace2023-fact-checking-claims-candidates-seeking-govern-nigerias-economic
The number of children attending public schools in Lagos is 14% for primary school …,Incorrect,"The Lagos public school system was failing, Rhodes-Vivour said during the debate. As evidence, he claimed only 14% of the state’s pupils were in public primary schools. The 2019 federal education ministry’s Nigeria digest of education statistics puts the number of primary school pupils in Lagos at 885,045. Of these, 405,316 were in public schools and 479,729 in private schools.  But the digest adds that the figure for private schools was from as far back as 2016, so it could now be significantly more.  Working with the available figures, the share of pupils in public schools comes to 45.8%, three times higher than Rhodes-Vivour claimed. The Lagos state annual school census report for 2019 gives a slightly lower figure of 402,770 public primary schools in the state, but does not give a figure for private schools. – Allwell Okpi",08/02/2023,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/lagosrace2023-fact-checking-claims-candidates-seeking-govern-nigerias-economic
… and just over 25% for secondary schools.,Incorrect,"Rhodes-Vivour also said that only 25% of secondary school students were in public schools. The 2019 education digest breaks down the data for secondary schools into junior and senior secondary. Lagos had 543,242 students in junior secondary schools in 2019. Of these 372,883, or 68.64%, were in public schools.    In the same year there were 394,884 students in senior secondary. Of these, 242,255 or 61.35% attended public schools, while the rest were in private schools.  The Lagos school census has lower numbers – 372,295 students in public junior secondary and 234,611 in public senior secondary.

"Lagos state has not implemented the 65 years retirement policy for teachers, signed by the Nigerian president, Muhammadu Buhari, in 2020 ...",Correct,"The most recent data from the 2019 Nigeria digest of education statistics puts the total number of teachers in Lagos state at 177,558. Of those, 60,216 were primary school teachers, 51,902 junior secondary school teachers and 65,440 secondary school teachers. To mark world teachers’ day in October 2020, Buhari announced improved terms for teachers. Eight months later the president asked the national assembly to raise teachers’ retirement age from 60 to 65 years. This was approved and became national law in April 2022.  But does the law apply in Lagos? The new retirement age or years of service was yet to be implemented in the state, Akintoye Hassan, the chairperson of the Nigerian Union of Teachers in Lagos, told Africa Check. “We are yet to have the implementation of the 65 years in Lagos state,” he said. “The union is still making efforts to make the government pronounce the approval of it so urgently before the election.” – Catherine Adeniyi",08/02/2023,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/lagosrace2023-fact-checking-claims-candidates-seeking-govern-nigerias-economic

Teachers’ union chair Hassan told Africa Check that Lagos was not the only state yet to put the new terms in place.

But in 2019 state education commissioner Folashade Adefisayo reportedly said there were 18,573 private schools in Lagos. Adefisayo is also on record as saying in May 2021 that only a quarter of the roughly 20,000 private schools in Lagos were registered with the state.

That’s about 10,000.",Mostly correct,"Doherty said if he were elected his administration would review Lagos’s education curriculum so as to produce more skilled workers. He claimed that only 10,000, or 1%, of the state’s 1 million public school students attended technical schools.   These schools train students to become technicians: mechanics, electricians, welders, plumbers, caterers, and graphic designers. A student has to have completed junior secondary to be admitted to a public technical school in Lagos.  The Lagos state schools census 2018/19 is the most recent data on the state’s website. It shows there were 1,082,634 students in its public schools, of which 7,825, or 0.72%, were in technical schools. – Allwell Okpi",08/02/2023,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/lagosrace2023-fact-checking-claims-candidates-seeking-govern-nigerias-economic
he median age in Nigeria is about 17.,Correct,"Nigeria’s youthful population was an advantage for Lagos state in areas such as sports, Doherty said. He then claimed the median age in Nigeria was “about 17”.   The median age is the midpoint of a population’s age range. The number of people older than the median age is equal to the number of people who are younger.  The UN department of economic and social affairs population division gives Nigeria’s media age as 17.1 in 2022, and expected to inch up to 17.2 in 2023. In 1990, the country’s median age was 16.4.– Allwell Okpi",08/02/2023,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/lagosrace2023-fact-checking-claims-candidates-seeking-govern-nigerias-economic
"According to the national bureau of statistics, there are 2,561 registered doctors in Lagos.",Correct,"Moderator Victor Oladokun also made a few claims, most of them unproven. (See how we define this and other verdicts.)  One of his more checkable claims was about health staffing. “According to the National Bureau of Statistics, there are 2,561 registered doctors in Lagos,” he said. The bureau’s most recent data, published in August 2021, did estimate this number for 2019. Of these, 1,490 were male and 1,071 female. The Lagos doctor brain drain  But the data leaves out the issue of brain drain. There were 7,343 registered doctors in Lagos state in 2017, and 8,276 in 2018. Dr Benjamin Olowojebutu, the chair of the Lagos chapter of the Nigerian Medical Association said in December 2022 that 507 of the state’s doctors had migrated to the UK from March 2020 to October 2022.  In December 2022 alone, Olowojebutu said, Lagos state lost more than 1,800 doctors and other healthcare workers to brain drain. These exits meant the NBS estimate should not be taken as being the same today, Leo Sanni, a statistical information officer at the bureau, told Africa Check. – Motunrayo Joel",08/02/2023,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/lagosrace2023-fact-checking-claims-candidates-seeking-govern-nigerias-economic
"The World Health Organization (WHO) recommended doctor-to-patients ratio is 1:1,000.",Incorrect,"Africa Check has fact-checked several claims about a doctor-to-patient ratio supposedly recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO).  But the WHO has said it does not prescribe any ideal ratio “because there isn’t a simple answer or one-size-fits-all solution”. “All health systems are different: different organisations, different financial systems, different organisations of the workforce. What could work in one country would not in another,” a WHO expert previously told us. The WHO only says countries with fewer than 10 doctors – and 40 nurses and midwives – for every 10,000 people do not have enough healthcare professionals. – Motunrayo Joel",08/02/2023,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/lagosrace2023-fact-checking-claims-candidates-seeking-govern-nigerias-economic
"The [doctor-to-patient] ratio in Lagos is 1:8,980.",Unproven,"Oladokun claimed that there were 23 million people living in Lagos. If this were true, his claim would be correct.  But the state’s population is highly controversial. Nigeria’s last census, in 2006, estimated there were 9 million Lagosians. In data published on its website in 2015, which remains up, the state government gave the population as 24.6 million. Just a year later, the NBS estimated the state’s population at 12.6 million. – Motunrayo Joel",08/02/2023,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/lagosrace2023-fact-checking-claims-candidates-seeking-govern-nigerias-economic
The doctor-to-patient ratio in Lagos is almost nine times more than what the WHO recommends.,Unproven,"As noted in the previous two claims, and working with Oladokun’s population estimate and the NBS’s registered doctor estimate of 2,561, the ratio is 1:8,980 – nine times – what the WHO is claimed to have recommended. But with weak data on state and doctor population, and a nonexistent WHO recommendation, the claim is unproven. –Motunrayo Joel",08/02/2023,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/lagosrace2023-fact-checking-claims-candidates-seeking-govern-nigerias-economic
Only 10% of 23 million people in Lagos have access to pipe-borne water.,Understated,"Oladokun claimed that only a 10th of Lagos’s 23 million people have access to pipe-borne water. Pipe-borne water is potable water free of contamination, particularly by faeces.  To check this claim, we consulted the 2021 water, sanitation and hygiene national outcome routine mapping survey, or Wash-Norm. This is an annual survey by the federal water ministry, done in partnership with the NBS and the UN’s children agency, Unicef. The 2021 Wash-Norm survey is the third in the series, after the 2018 and 2019 editions. Published in June 2022, it covers 13,376,240 households in Lagos. It found that only 5.3% of the state’s population has access to pipe-borne water.  Another data source is the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey. After assessing 12,588 households from September 2021 to December 2021, the survey estimated that 5% of people in Lagos have access to pipe-borne water. –Motunrayo Joel",08/02/2023,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/lagosrace2023-fact-checking-claims-candidates-seeking-govern-nigerias-economic
About 60% of Lagos population are aged 16 to 35. That is 13 million young people.,Unproven,"We traced this claim to a December 2022 report in the Guardian, a Nigerian newspaper. It claims that the state has a population of about 25 million, and that 60% of its young people are aged 15 to 35.  This works out at 10 million young people, not 13 million. The state’s most recent demographic report is from 2015. This gave the state’s population as 23 million, nearly two thirds (64%) of them aged 15 to 59. This translates to 14.7 million people. – Motunrayo Joel",08/02/2023,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/lagosrace2023-fact-checking-claims-candidates-seeking-govern-nigerias-economic

We have asked the agency for this information but are yet to hear back. We will update this report with their response. There have been several estimates in the media, including this blog which appears to be the source of the claim’s 1.49 million figure.

This means we have a deficit of 3.2 million homes [in Lagos].,Unproven,"The blog also claims Lagos state has a deficit of 3.2 million housing units. But in the absence of data we also rate this claim as unproven. A major issue with housing in Lagos was the lack of data on the number of housing units the state needed, Eziyi Ibem, the head of the University of Nigeria’s architecture department, told Africa Check.  “All the data being published in the news media and academic papers are based on estimations. As a result, it is difficult to know the exact housing supply deficit in Lagos,” he said.  “The best approach to knowing the right housing stock is to carry out an accurate housing census in Lagos. I hope the upcoming national census can help in achieving this.” Ibem said developing housing standards for low-income people would help solve the state’s housing crisis. “Based on this housing standard, religious organisations, philanthropic organisations and housing cooperatives would be encouraged to invest heavily in social housing programmes for the poor and low-income earners in the city.  “This can succeed with support from the government in the provision of land and housing infrastructure.” – Motunrayo Joel",08/02/2023,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/lagosrace2023-fact-checking-claims-candidates-seeking-govern-nigerias-economic
Nigeria became the poverty capital during the tenure of this government.,Misleading,"In 2021, we fact-checked a similar claim after the PDP blamed the APC for the popular social media platform Twitter’s decision to pick Ghana instead of Nigeria for its Africa office. The claim has its origin in the World Poverty Clock, developed by the World Data Lab, a research firm focused on the United Nations sustainable development goals.  In 2018 it estimated that the number of people in Nigeria living in extreme poverty, defined as less than $1.90 a day, exceeded that in India.  This led to headlines such as “Nigeria overtakes India as world’s poverty capital”. As of January 2023 the clock showed that 606.75 million people lived in extreme poverty globally, with 71.28 million or 11.9% of them in Nigeria. This is about 32% of Nigeria’s estimated 2023 population of 220.45 million. Outgoing president Muhammadu Buhari of the APC took office in 2015, informing the claim that Nigeria became the world’s “poverty capital” under him. But is his government really to blame?      Experts trace origins of poverty crisis back to 1980s  The APC administration did carry some responsibility, but it was misleading to blame only one government, Gafar Ijaiya told Africa Check. Ijaiya is a professor of economics who analyses poverty at the University of Ilorin in north-central Nigeria. “Previous administrations contributed to the state of the country, in terms of the poverty rate,” he said. “Poverty, like unemployment, builds up over a long time, and measuring it accurately is not easy because it is microeconomics, affecting households and individuals.” Ijaiya highlighted the structural adjustment programme (SAP) of 1986 as a significant contributor to poverty in Nigeria. Structural adjustment programmes are controversial, and require a country to make economic changes in exchange for loans from the International Monetary Fund or the World Bank. Samuel Igbatayo is a professor of economics at the Afe Babalola University in Ado-Ekiti, southwest Nigeria. “Nigeria becoming the world's poverty capital in 2018, under Buhari’s administration, cannot be blamed on any administration. It is an accumulation over the years,” he told Africa Check. Igbatayo, who researches poverty reduction and the agricultural commodity value chain, also traced the current high poverty rate to the 1980s. “Before 1980, poverty was not widespread. It was restricted to some rural areas. But a global recession and oil price collapse affected Nigeria and led to poverty becoming endemic in the country.” In focusing only on the APC’s term in office and not addressing the long-term nature of poverty, Ohuabunwa’s claim is misleading.",02/02/2023,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/nothing-under-government-fact-checking-five-claims-about-record-nigerias
Nigeria has the highest unemployment in youth.,Unproven,"Ohuabunwa’s gist was that under the APC, Nigeria had the highest youth unemployment rate in its history.  The country’s most recent unemployment data covered the fourth quarter – the last three months – of 2020. The National Bureau of Statistics found that the national unemployment rate was 33.3% and the underemployment rate 22.8%. Youth unemployment, of people aged 15 to 34, was 42.5%, and youth underemployment was 21%.  But is this the highest in the country’s history? How Nigeria measures its unemployment rate has changed significantly over the years, Dr Baba Madu, the head of the national accounts division at the statistics bureau, told Africa Check. So we can’t categorically say this was the highest rate in history.  Madu said that previously, a person was considered unemployed if they did not work for at least 40 hours a week. “Now we count you as unemployed if you did nothing or worked less than 20 hours a week,” he said. “You are considered fully employed if you work up to 40 hours or more a week.”  And before, there were also only two categories – employed or unemployed. “We reviewed this and included underemployment. You are underemployed if you work between 20 and 39 hours a week or you are engaged in activities that are significantly lower than your qualification. For instance, a university graduate riding an okada [a commercial motorcycle] to earn a living,” Madu said.  This review was done in September 2014. For more details, read our factsheet.   “Due to changes to the methodology for measuring employment in Nigeria, unemployment rates cannot be compared across these years. So I cannot say whether this is the highest in history,” Madu said.",02/02/2023,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/nothing-under-government-fact-checking-five-claims-about-record-nigerias
Youth unemployment got up to 50%.,Incorrect,"Ohuabunwa clarified this claim, saying that Nigeria’s unemployment rate was “33% in 2021 with youth unemployment reaching 53%”.  But the National Bureau of Statistics hasn’t published any labour force data since the fourth quarter of 2020.   Madu told Africa Check that the bureau and its partners have completed the fieldwork for the next labour force statistics. “We are now doing the analysis. The data will be published most likely before the end of this quarter.” Until the new data is published, the numbers for the fourth quarter of 2020 remain the most recent. This data puts the youth unemployment rate at 42.5%, up from 34.9% in the second quarter of 2020. It defines youth as people aged 15 to 34.  There is no evidence the youth unemployment rate has ever reached 50% since the APC took power in 2015.  In a previous fact-check, we explain that the data shows that Nigeria’s unemployment rate, and youth unemployment, rose steadily from 2014 to 2018.  But the bureau’s breakdown of the unemployment rate by age shows that the rate was 53.4% for ages 15 to 24 and 37.2% for ages 25 to 34. Ohuabunwa would have been correct if he had been clear he was talking about young people aged 15 to 24.",02/02/2023,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/nothing-under-government-fact-checking-five-claims-about-record-nigerias
The misery index climbed” under the APC,Correct,"The misery index, created by US economist Arthur Okun, measures the degree of economic distress individuals and households in a country feel, relative to the availability of jobs and the cost of living. The index is calculated by adding the inflation and unemployment rates. The most recent version of the index was developed by Steve Hanke, a professor at Johns Hopkins University in the US. In addition to unemployment and inflation rates, it considers other indices such as bank lending rates and gross domestic product per person. Nigeria was not on Hanke’s 2015 misery index as “only countries with current data” were considered. In 2022 it ranked as the 11th most miserable out of 156 countries, with an index of 59.4. In our earlier analysis of how Nigerians have fared under Buhari’s government, we used Okun’s method to calculate the country’s misery index. It was 17.2 in the second quarter of 2015 when the APC came to power, climbing to 51.01 in 2022. Nigeria’s unemployment and inflation rates have gone up in the past seven years under Buhari.  The inflation rate went from 9% in May 2015 to 21.34% in December 2022. Unemployment rose from 8.2% in the second quarter of 2015 to 33.3% in the fourth quarter of 2020, which is the most recent data.

We are budgeting N3.6 trillion for subsidy payment.,Mostly correct,"Ohuabunwa also claimed in the interview that the APC-led federal government budgeted N3.6 trillion for fuel subsidy payments. But he didn’t say what period he was referring to.  We asked him, and he said he was talking about the amount budgeted for the first half of 2023. “I made reference to the budgeted subsidy payment of about 3.6 trillion for the first six months of 2023. My point is that [petrol] is selling at above the official price in most parts of the country. In the southeast and south-south, where I spent most of my time through December and now, prices range from N240 to N500 per litre in many filling stations,” he wrote in an email response to our query.  “Since nobody is enforcing the official prices, it is evident that the government has ‘surreptitiously’ removed the price cap, allowing market forces to determine the price. If the cap has been removed, then who is receiving the subsidy payment? Can we be paying subsidy and at the same time buying petrol at market price?” According to finance minister Zainab Ahmed, N3.36 trillion was earmarked for the fuel subsidy in Nigeria’s 2023 budget. This, she said, would cover subsidy payments for the first six months of 2023.    “In the 2023 budget framework, it is assumed that the petrol subsidy will remain up to mid-2023, based on the 18-month extension announced in early 2022. In this regard, only N3.36 trillion has been provided for PMS subsidy,” a 2023 budget document reads. Ohuabunwa’s claim of about N3.6 trillion is slightly higher than the actual figure, N3.36 trillion.",02/02/2023,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/nothing-under-government-fact-checking-five-claims-about-record-nigerias
Tinubu’s promise to the north: Mambila hydropower; Lake Chad; AKK pipeline; commercialised agriculture; reform of Almajiri system.,Correct,"Reliable electricity continues to elude many Nigerians for a number of reasons. The Mambilla hydropower project is expected to add capacity to the grid.  The project is located in the northern Taraba state and the contract for it was signed in 2017. It is projected to add 3,050 megawatts (MW) to the grid once complete. There are however concerns as to the slow pace of the project. The Ajaokuta-Kaduna-Kano (AKK) gas pipeline from the south to the north of the country is expected to increase Nigeria’s energy security. Agriculture is a key economic activity in Nigeria, contributing a quarter to the gross domestic product. In the north,  farming and livestock rearing are major means of livelihood and land use. The Almajiri system, prevalent in northern Nigeria, is where children from poor homes, mostly boys, are sent to distant places to acquire Qur’anic education under Islamic clerics. These children, however, often end up begging in the streets.  In Tinubu’s manifesto he does promise to complete the pipeline and to add value and improve incomes in agriculture, pledges he has repeated while campaigning.  He has also pledged to ”recharge” Lake Chad – it is not clear what this means but the lake has shrunk by as much as 90% due to climate change – and to reform the Almajiri system.    Tinubu did make these promises, and on this score, we rate the claim as correct. But the gist of the tweet is also that Tinubu has better plans for Nigerians if elected, compared to his rivals. The other presidential candidates “are [also] making similar promises”, Abdullahi Yusufu, a professor of political science at the Ahmadu Bello University in Zaria, northwestern Nigeria, told Africa Check. A quick search shows Atiku, for example, has also pledged to complete the Mambilla power project, as has Obi.  “The issue is whether these promises can be fulfilled,” Yusufu said, adding that the incumbent APC administration had not met all its pledges.",23/01/2023,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/influencer-makes-misleading-claims-about-presidential-candidates-promises-vote
Atiku’s promise to the north: To open the border. Sell everything to outsiders.,Misleading,"Atiku Abubakar was Nigeria’s vice president from 1999 to 2007 under the Peoples Democratic Party administration of president Olusegun Obasanjo. He joined the All Progressives Congress in 2014, helping defeat the PDP in elections the following year, but is now back on the PDP’s ticket. While campaigning in the northwestern state of Katsina in December 2022, Abubakar did promise to restore peace in the country and open all borders if elected. Nigeria has struggled with insecurity in recent years. In 2019 the country also shuttered its borders in an attempt to curb smuggling. In reaction, information minister Lai Mohammed said Abubakar’s plans would lead to mass imports of rice and other goods, hurting local farmers and manufacturers. More illegal arms would also come in and worsen insecurity, the minister claimed. “But it is misleading to say that is a promise to northern Nigeria,” political scientist Abdullahi Yusufu told Africa Check. “If the borders are open and there is increased trade and other things whether good or bad, it affects the whole country, not just the north. When [president Muhammadu] Buhari’s administration closed the borders, it affected all of us in the country,” he said.     ‘Sell everything to outsiders’    Garba’s claim that Abubakar wants to “sell everything” is a reference to his promise to privatise dysfunctional companies and infrastructure. Abubakar made the proposal when he ran for president in 2019 and has continued to insist that public assets are better run by the private sector.  This has been seized upon by Tinubu, who often refers to Abubakar as “Mr Sell Everything” or “Mr Privatise”. Tinubu claims his rival wants to sell national assets to “the highest bidder and his cronies and run off with the proceeds”.   Abubakar, for instance, has proposed that the country’s petroleum refineries, which are largely not functional, should be sold to private companies that can revamp and run them profitably while creating jobs. But there is no evidence Abubakar has promised to sell public assets to “outsiders”.   What Abubakar did promise the north In his manifesto, campaign speeches, and media interviews, Abubakar has made some promises that would more specifically benefit the north.  These include his promise to prioritise the Mambilla hydropower project and the broader development of the northeast, which has been significantly set back by the Boko Haram insurgency.  He has promised to end insurgency in the north using alternative approaches, including diplomacy, the use of traditional institutions, better intelligence and border control.",23/01/2023,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/influencer-makes-misleading-claims-about-presidential-candidates-promises-vote
Peter Obi’s promise to the north: more spareparts shops.,Incorrect,"There isn’t publicly available evidence Obi has ever made this promise, either in his manifesto or his speeches on the campaign trail. Yusufu Zoaka, professor of political science at the University of Abuja, also told Africa Check the claim about Obi is false. “Obi has made some promises to the north but not to bring more spare parts shops,” he said.      The claim is grounded in a false ethnic narrative, Kamilu Fage, professor of political science at Bayero University Kano in northwestern Nigeria, told Africa Check.  “The person that made that tweet is trying to promote his own candidate and put the other candidates in a bad light. Saying Peter Obi wants to bring more spare parts shops to the north is not really derogatory because we all need spare parts because most of us drive used cars.  “The problem is that the person is trying to say that Obi is only interested in promoting his own people, the Igbo, who are the major dealers of motor spare parts across Nigeria, not just in the north,” he said.   False and misleading narratives influence poor and illiterate voters  Politics is like a game: every player has his own game plan, including propaganda, Yusufu said.   “This is part of the strategy they are using to promote their candidates. It is propaganda; a politician trying to sell his presidential candidate by all means at the expense of other candidates. In propaganda, there is often an element of truth mixed with lies,” he said. Zoaka said democracy does not do well in countries with low incomes.  “Nigeria’s per capita is just over US$2,000. This means that a large portion of the country’s population is poor and illiterate. They can be easily manipulated by politicians,” he told Africa Check.  “This kind of social media post plays on the ignorance of many impoverished and illiterate voters in the north. And the narratives sell especially in rural areas, where many cannot spot false information. They are likely to believe false narratives, especially those regarding ethnicity and religion, and share them with others,” Zoaka said.  Fage, however, said the impact of the narrative could be reduced when the people realise that the person saying it is partisan.  Apart from his pledge to tackle Nigeria’s insecurity problems, Obi’s main promise to the north has been for an “agricultural revolution” to reduce poverty.",23/01/2023,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/influencer-makes-misleading-claims-about-presidential-candidates-promises-vote
80% of the crude oil is being stolen.,Incorrect,"Adebayo argued that the administration of outgoing president Muhammadu Buhari had mismanaged the economy, including its vital crude oil and natural gas resources.  He claimed that as much as 80% of Nigeria’s crude oil was being stolen. The theft of the country’s main export has been widely reported.   But are as many as eight of every 10 barrels of oil produced in Nigeria stolen? The Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission regulates oil and gas production. As part of this, it tracks how much oil is produced. In June 2022, agency chief executive Gbenga Komolafe was quoted saying that in the first three months of the year, oil theft had been estimated at a daily average of 120,000 barrels. In that period, Nigeria’s central bank recorded production at more than 1.2 million barrels every day – an average of 1.4 million in January, 1.26 million in February and 1.24 million in March. The estimated figure of 120,000 barrels is less than 10% of oil produced. Others have given higher estimates of up to 400,000 barrels a day, but this still does not translate to 80% of the country’s output. – Allwell Okpi",13/12/2022,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/oil-money-guns-fact-checking-nigerian-presidential-hopefuls-claims-town-hall-tv
" will put [at the helm of the central bank of Nigeria] for the first time in a long time, an economist.",Misleading,"Adebayo said the Central Bank of Nigeria’s performance has been poor and included the mismanagement of monetary policy.  As a solution, he pledged to pick an economist – for “the first time in a long time” – as the bank’s governor.   Nigeria has had four central bank governors since its return to multiparty democracy in 1999. Two of them were economists, one appointed as recently as 2014.  Joseph Sanusi, in office from 1999 to 2004, is an accountant. He studied accounting and has experience in capital markets and banking.  Chukwuma Soludo, the governor from 2004 to 2009, is a professor of economics. He trained at institutions such the Brookings Institution in the US and the University of Cambridge in the UK.  Soludo’s successor, Sanusi Lamido Sanusi, has a bachelor's degree in economics and taught economics at Ahmadu Bello University before going into banking. He was governor from 2009 to 2014.  The current bank governor, Godwin Emefiele, has been in office since 2014. He studied banking and finance and taught finance and insurance at two Nigerian universities before beginning his banking career.  But is it important that the bank be led by an economist? Yes, it is important for the governor of the central bank to be an economist, we were told by Ifuero Osamwonyi, a professor of finance at the University of Benin in southern Nigeria.  “The governor of CBN needs to be experienced in macroeconomic modelling. The person needs to be grounded in matters of monetary policy and the macroeconomics of the country and the world,” he said.  Macroeconomics is concerned with factors that affect the whole economy, such as unemployment, inflation and economic growth.   In Osamwonyi’s view, Soludo has been the most qualified of the bank’s governors so far, due to his work in macroeconomics before his time in office. – Allwell Okpi   Candidate: Omoyele Sowore, African Action Congress (AAC)",13/12/2022,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/oil-money-guns-fact-checking-nigerian-presidential-hopefuls-claims-town-hall-tv
he previous government spent $16 billion [on the power sector] but there is still no power,Incorrect,"Sowore, an activist and media entrepreneur, is a well-known critic of the government.  He attributed Nigeria’s electricity challenge to a succession of governments. He then repeated a claim that has been making the rounds for more than a decade – that the Nigerian government has spent US$16 billion on electricity and still failed to solve the problem.  The claim is often made in reference to the spending of president Olusegun Obasanjo’s administration on what were known as the National Independent Power Projects during its term from 1999 to 2007. Obasanjo governed under the Peoples Democratic Party, which is hoping to succeed the APC.  But is the claim correct?  Despite being alluded to several times by APC leaders and Buhari officials, there are still no publicly available official records that support this. A 2017 report by the Lagos-based nonprofit Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project found the Obasanjo administration spent $10 billion and not $16 billion on the power projects. A year later Obasanjo shared the findings of a 2007 probe by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission. This found far lower spending on the projects: about N1.23 trillion (US$9.64 billion). But only about N360.7 billion ($2.8 billion at the official exchange rate of N127.5 to $1 in May 2007) had been paid out when Obasanjo left office. And the Power Holding Company of Nigeria (formerly the National Electric Power Authority), which oversaw the projects, received N273.65 billion from 1999 to 2007. That comes to $2.15 billion, using the average 2007 exchange rate. This still does not add up to the $16 billion claimed.

China has more guns than Nigeria.,Correct,"Sowore said Nigeria’s insecurity problem could not be solved without investments in social security or policies that aim to cushion individuals and households against possible hardships.  China had more guns than Nigeria but it resolved its security challenges by investing a lot in social security, he said. A 2018 survey estimated that there were 6.2 million firearms in the hands of civilians in Nigeria, or 3.21 firearms per 100 people. The research found civilians in China held 49.7 million firearms, or 3.58 firearms per 100 people.

"Buhari said he wanted to reduce the jet fleet, but he kept increasing it.",Incorrect,"The media have reported that president Buhari, first elected in 2015, tried to meet his campaign promise “to look at the presidential air fleet with a view to cutting down on waste”. Two planes from the fleet were put up for sale in 2016. In September 2020 the presidency reportedly tried to sell another aircraft. But there is no evidence any of the sales have gone through.  The cost of maintaining the fleet has reportedly risen by over 120% in the past eight years. This does not mean new planes were added. We found no evidence that the Buhari administration has added any new planes to the presidential fleet. – Allwell Okpi Candidate: Rabiu Kwankwaso, New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP)",13/12/2022,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/oil-money-guns-fact-checking-nigerian-presidential-hopefuls-claims-town-hall-tv
I never borrowed money when I was governor of Kano state.,Incorrect,"Rabiu Kwankwaso was governor of the northwestern Nigerian state of Kano from 1999 to 2003. He returned in 2011 for another term, which ended in 2015.  He has repeatedly claimed he did not borrow money to run his administration during both terms as governor. But available evidence does not support the claim.   The national media reported that Kwankwaso borrowed N4.1 billion from pension funds to build the Bandirawo, Amana and Kwankwasiya housing estates, a “mega city” project that he hoped to leave as a legacy. Data from the country’s Debt Management Office (DMO) show that Kano state’s domestic debt, owed to Nigerian banks, increased by nearly N60 billion from 2011 to 2015.  Kwankwaso’s second term began on 29 May 2011. The DMO later published a report that showed Kano’s domestic debt was N5.87 billion at the end of December 2011.  By the end of December 2015, it had jumped to N65 billion. Kwankwaso left office on 29 May 2015. But since the DMO only publishes state-level data at the end of the year, we were not able to establish the exact debt at his departure. Data from the agency does show that the state’s external debt, owed to other countries or multilateral organisations such as the World Bank, dropped slightly during the period. External debt was $63.9 million on 30 June 2011. It dropped to $59.8 million on 30 June 2015. – Allwell Okpi",13/12/2022,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/oil-money-guns-fact-checking-nigerian-presidential-hopefuls-claims-town-hall-tv
I didn't leave debt in my two terms in office as the governor of Kano state.,Incorrect,"Kwankwaso was Kano governor from 1999 to 2003 and again from 2011 to 2015.  Data from the debt office shows the state owed $59.8 million to external creditors as of 30 June 2015 – a month after he left the office.  The office didn’t publish data for domestic debt in June 2015. But at the end of that year, Kano’s domestic debt was N65 billion.  Kwankwaso’s successor, Umar Ganduje, told journalists two days after he became governor that there was nothing wrong with Kwankwaso’s administration leaving the state with over N300 billion in debt.  We could not find independent data on Kano’s debt profile when Kwankwaso left office in 2003. Publicly available official data only goes back to 2006. – Allwell Okpi",13/12/2022,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/oil-money-guns-fact-checking-nigerian-presidential-hopefuls-claims-town-hall-tv
I spent more than the 25% Unesco recommendation funding for education while serving as Kano governor.,Exaggerated,"Kwankwaso said that if he were elected, he would ensure the national budget for education would be more than what the country currently spends, as he had done when he was governor of Kano state. He referred to a widely quoted “25% recommendation” for education funding he said was by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Education (Unesco).  There is no evidence the UN agency has such a recommendation. In 2017, Nigeria’s education minister Adamu Adamu debunked a similar claim of a “26% Unesco recommendation”. He said Unesco officials had confirmed the agency has not recommended such a benchmark. The only recommendation we found is that of a 2015 global education monitoring report commissioned by Unesco.  The report proposed that governments should spend 4% to 6% of their gross national product, or 15% to 20% of their national budget, on education. But Unesco said it did not represent its opinion.  Kwankwaso set aside less than 25% of Kano’s budget for education  Budget data on the Kano state website dates back only to 2016. But we found other documents online that show how much was budgeted for education in Kano under Kwankwaso’s administration.  In his 2012 budget speech to the state assembly, Kwankwaso proposed a total budget of N210.38 billion.  “Mr Speaker, we are determined to address the apparent collapse of the education sector. We thus plan to spend a total of N35 billion on education,” he was quoted as saying. The N35 billion was 16.6% of the total budget. N221.62 billion was eventually approved, with education getting a total of N35.5 billion, or 15.9%. The 2015 budget, the last of Kwankwaso’s Kano governorship, allocated N29.55 billion to the education ministry and N18.83 billion to the higher education ministry.  That meant the total education budget was N48.38 billion.  The N48.38 billion amounted to 23% of Kano’s total budget of N210 billion in 2015. – Allwell Okpi  Candidate: Peter Obi, Labour Party",13/12/2022,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/oil-money-guns-fact-checking-nigerian-presidential-hopefuls-claims-town-hall-tv
"he 2021 budget was N21 trillion, with an N11 trillion deficit",Incorrect,"Responding to a question on how he would reduce the budget deficit if elected, Peter Obi gave the country’s 2021 budget as N21 trillion, with a N11 trillion shortfall. Obi is running on the Labour Party ticket.  A deficit is the difference between what a government earns and what it spends. Budget office documents show N13.6 trillion was budgeted for the 2021 budget, and not N21 trillion. The budget deficit for that year was also lower, at N5.6 trillion. Obi’s claim about a N11 trillion deficit would have been correct if he was referring to the 2023 budget. – Motunrayo Joel",13/12/2022,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/oil-money-guns-fact-checking-nigerian-presidential-hopefuls-claims-town-hall-tv
srael’s exports in 2021 were valued at $59.8 billion,Incorrect,"Expressing his position on the country’s several different exchange rates, Obi said the naira's weakness against other currencies should be tackled.  He linked this fragility to the country’s low reserves. He then compared Nigeria’s earnings from its exports to those of the Middle Eastern country of Israel.  He claimed that Israel’s exports in 2021 were worth $59.8 billion. According to the World Bank, Israel’s export earnings in 2021 were far more, at $143 billion. Nigeria’s earnings from export in 2019, the year for which the bank last has data, was $63.73 billion. Israel's exports include precious metals and stones, electrical and mechanical machinery, as well as appliances and chemicals.  Obi also gave the value of the Southeast Asian country of Vietnam’s exports as being over $350 billion, even though the country has only a fraction of Nigeria’s population. Official data shows the country exported $336.31 billion in 2021.  Obi’s overall argument about Nigeria’s need to strengthen exports was made, but he used incorrect figures. Nigeria exports mainly raw materials Nigeria’s industries were weak and on their deathbeds, Abayomi Adebayo, a professor of labour and development economics at the Obafemi Awolowo University in the southwestern Nigerian state of Osun, told Africa Check. Adebayo said Nigeria mainly exported raw materials, and earnings from these tended to be lower. “We should work on how to process what we export to earn more. Refine crude oil for internal use and export to other countries. We must also begin to produce things internally. We are weak in the production of anything. This must change.” – Motunrayo Joel",13/12/2022,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/oil-money-guns-fact-checking-nigerian-presidential-hopefuls-claims-town-hall-tv
"Today, we have an installed capacity of 12,500 MW.",Unproven,"The Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission by law regulates the country’s electricity supply. According to the commission, Nigeria had a total installed capacity of 10,396 megawatts (MW) in 2017, with available capacity being 6,056 MW. Installed capacity is the maximum theoretical electricity output when power generation operates at 100%. Effective capacity, on the other hand, is the expected output when operating constraints are factored in. In 2018 installed capacity was 12,522MW. In 2022, vice president Yemi Osinbajo said the country’s installed capacity was more than 18,000 MW. We have asked the commission for official data.

Oil is 50% of government revenue.,Incorrect,"Obi did not give a timeframe for when oil was 50% of the Nigerian government’s revenue. The most recent data on this is from the central bank data, for the second quarter of 2022 – the months of April, May and June. This shows that non-oil income accounted for 59.5% of revenue, while revenue from oil was 40.5%, a pattern carried over from the previous quarter. – Motunrayo Joel",13/12/2022,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/oil-money-guns-fact-checking-nigerian-presidential-hopefuls-claims-town-hall-tv
il is 80% of foreign exchange revenue.,Correct,"Obi added that oil accounts for 80% of the country’s foreign exchange revenue. Foreign exchange reserves are assets held by a monetary authority in foreign currency. They include banknotes, deposits, bonds, treasury bills and other foreign government securities.  According to National Bureau of Statistics data, crude oil accounted for 78.51% of the country’s total exports in the third quarter – July, August and September – of 2022.  ‘We need to boost our reserves’ The pressure on reserves is enormous, with more going out than coming in. That’s what Dr Muda Yusuf, the former director general of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry, told Africa Check.  He gave “demand side” examples of how Nigeria could boost its reserves. They include reducing the import of petroleum products, reviewing the country’s industrialisation strategy to make it less dependent on raw material imports, and securing and developing agriculture to cut food imports. On the “supply side”, Yusuf highlighted the challenge of oil theft, which meant the country was not meeting its targets.  The country’s foreign exchange policy should also “be market driven to improve foreign exchange liquidity in the economy”, he said. He added that Nigeria should grow its non-oil exports to add to increased forex inflows. – Motunrayo Joel",13/12/2022,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/oil-money-guns-fact-checking-nigerian-presidential-hopefuls-claims-town-hall-tv
ritain does not have a written constitution,Correct,"Obi claimed that Britain has an unwritten constitution. Is this true? Robert Blackburn, a professor of constitutional law at King’s College London, explains this in a 2015 article for the country’s national library. It’s titled: “Britain's unwritten constitution”. “From a comparative perspective, we have what is known as an ‘unwritten constitution’, although some prefer to describe it as ‘uncodified’ on the basis that many of our laws of a constitutional nature are in fact written down in Acts of Parliament or law reports of court judgments,” the article reads.   A codified constitution is written down clearly in a specific document, called “the constitution” of a country.  “This aspect of the British constitution, its unwritten nature, is its most distinguishing characteristic,” Blackburn writes. – Motunrayo Joel",13/12/2022,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/oil-money-guns-fact-checking-nigerian-presidential-hopefuls-claims-town-hall-tv
"In 2014, when I left office, in terms of poverty Anambra [was] number three with 11.2% after Lagos.",Correct,"Obi was governor of the southeastern state of Anambra over three stints spanning 2006 to 2014. He claimed that when he left office, the share of poor people in Anambra was a low 11.2%.  We traced this data to a 2017 paper on poverty by the University of Oxford in the UK. This used several indicators to work out what is known as the multidimensional poverty index. The index reflects the share of possible deprivations that poor people experience. It gives the results as a range, with zero being no poverty and one the highest deprivation. In addition to a national figure, the research found that the share of poor people in Lagos state, the economic hub, was 8.5%, followed by Osun (10.9%) and then Anambra (11.2%). What does more recent data suggest? The 2022 Nigeria Multidimensional Poverty Index survey from Nigeria’s national statistics office has a more recent estimate. According to the survey, 133 million Nigerians are multidimensionally poor, with the states of Sokoto, Bayelsa, Gombe, Jigawa and Plateau the poorest. Sokoto leads with 90.5% followed by Bayelsa (88.5%), Gombe (86.2%), Jigawa (84.3%), and Plateau (84%).

We have an informal sector that is 60% of our economy.,Mostly correct,"The most recent economic data from the Nigeria statistics bureau that differentiates between the formal and informal sectors is from 2015. It gives the share of the informal sector as 41.43%.  In 2017, the International Monetary Fund estimated that the informal sector contributed as much as 65% to Nigeria’s gross domestic product (GDP) - a commonly used measure of an economy’s size.  A 2021 World Bank database used two methods to estimate Nigeria’s informal economy as between 48.2% and 56.2% of the official 2018 GDP. Developing economies ‘have bigger informal economies’  It was normal for developing economies like Nigeria to have a large informal sector, Oluranti Olurinola, a professor of economics at Covenant University, Ota in southwest Nigeria, told Africa Check.  “The size of the informal sector is usually inversely proportional to development. So, you see that it is developing and emerging nations that have the largest informal sectors,” Olurinola said.  More developed countries, like the OECD countries, have small informal economies because a lot of things are well-structured.”  The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development or OECD is an economic grouping of 38 mainly European countries. – Allwell Okpi",13/12/2022,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/oil-money-guns-fact-checking-nigerian-presidential-hopefuls-claims-town-hall-tv
84% of our employment is in [the informal] economy.,Mostly correct,"Employment in the informal sector may be even more than 84%, Olunrinola said.  “Different studies in different parts of the country show that over 80% of employment is in the informal sector. I recently reviewed one of such studies done by the Nigeria Institute of Social and Economic Research. I am aware it will be published soon,” he said. In 2021, the World Bank published a paper titled “The Long Shadow of Informality: Challenges and Policies”. It found that 80.4 % of employment in Nigeria is in the informal sector. Neither the National Bureau of Statistics nor the federal ministry of labour and employment has data on employment in the informal sector.

But Sowore was accurate regarding the specific law – section 12 of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2007.

The deficit-to-GDP ratio is now at 5%.,Mostly correct,"Nigerians have been debating the budget because it proposes to spend less on capital projects like roads, schools, hospitals and other public infrastructure. The federal government projects that it will raise N16.87 trillion as revenue in 2023. But only N9.73 trillion will be available to fund the federal budget, with the rest going to states and local governments. The federal government plans to borrow N10.78 trillion, or about half the total budget. This means that of the planned expenditure of N20.51 trillion, it has a deficit of N10.78 trillion.  Buhari gave the resulting deficit-to-GDP ratio as 4.78%. (Note: The budget did not give a GDP figure, but projected growth of 3.75% in 2023.) “We plan to finance the deficit mainly by new borrowings totalling N8.8 trillion,” he said.

Lagos is now the third largest economy in Africa.,Incorrect,"Gross domestic product (GDP) is a commonly used measure of the size of an economy. It is the market value of all goods and services produced in a given period, usually a year. Economists have told Africa Check that it is acceptable to compare the GDP of different geographical regions. The most recent data from the World Bank shows Nigeria’s GDP was US$440.8 billion in 2021. This is the largest in Africa, a position Nigeria has held since 2013 when it “rebased” its GDP to more accurately capture economic activities.  Lagos, with an estimated population of more than 15 million, is Nigeria’s financial hub. But how big is its economy? The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) publishes quarterly GDP numbers. But they do not include figures for subnational regions like states.  For this data, Leo Sanni, a statistical information officer at NBS, referred us to the Lagos Bureau of Statistics. In a report on its website, the Lagos bureau gave the state’s GDP as N26.6 trillion in 2021, having increased from N23.9 trillion in 2020. Nigeria’s official exchange rate often varies. In 2021 it was between N379 and N413.9 to the US dollar. This works out to a GDP of between $64.2 billion and $70.2 billion.   At least eight African countries recorded a GDP higher than this in 2021.

In 1999 Lagos was generating N700 million in internally generated revenue per month.,Understated,"Shettima claimed that in 1999, when Tinubu took office, Lagos earned N700 million monthly as its own revenue, but this had now reached N50 billion. Internally generated revenue is defined as what states earn, independent of the funds they receive from Nigeria’s federal government. NBS data on this indicator goes back to 2010, when Lagos generated N185.9 billion, or an average of N15.5 billion monthly. Using referencing clues from a 2014 journal paper that analysed internally generated revenue, we looked up statistical bulletin data from the Central Bank of Nigeria. Links for the 1999 and 2000 bulletins were broken. In 2001 Lagos earned N12.5 billion. This was the same figure as in a journal paper authored by two researchers working with the national assembly’s research arm at the time.  Their paper also gave internal revenue for Lagos as N11.6 billion in 2000 and N14.6 billion (or an average of N1.2 billion monthly) in 1999. This is at least N460 million a month more than claimed.

In December 2021, Lagos governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, was quoted by the media saying the state has “grown its internally generated revenue from N600 million monthly in 1999 to over N45 billion monthly as of today, an astounding increase of 7,400%.” There is no evidence the state now generates an average revenue of N50 billion monthly.",14/09/2022,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/nigeriadecides2023-ruling-apc-party-chiefs-fall-flat-tv-claims-about-economy
The growth of Lagos’ internally generated revenue from N600 million to N51 billion monthly is the record of Bola Tinubu.,Misleading,"In his interview, Keyamo referred to Tinubu as “a wealth creator”.  Lagos governor Sanwo-Olu has credited Tinubu for starting revenue reforms in the state.  But the size of the revenue and the increase in funds is not due to any single administration, Sheriffdeen Tella, a professor of economics at the Olabisi Onabanjo University in southwestern Nigeria, told Africa Check.  “Lagos has had good administrators as governors over the years but the increase in the state’s revenue cannot solely be the result of the effort of any government or administration,” he said.  Tella said the natural location of Lagos near the sea and increased commerce due to the large population were some factors responsible for the increase in revenue.  Successive governors had used the increased funds to expand the city, he added.

We have recorded a 5% increase in the inflationary rate between 2020 and now [2022].,Incorrect,"To support his point that Buhari’s administration had run the economy well, Keyamo said Nigeria’s economic woes should be viewed within the global context.  He then claimed that the country’s inflation rate had increased by only 5% between 2020 and 2022. But he seems to have mixed up a percentage point increase with a percentage increase. Keyamo said inflation moved from about 13% in 2020 to about 18% in 2022. The difference between these is five percentage points, not 5%. (For more on this, read our guide to avoiding common statistical errors.) Further, the data shows he compared two different indices.  In 2020, the monthly year-on-year inflation rate varied from 12.13% in January to 12.56% in June and 15.75% in December. However, the 12-month average change in December 2020 was 13.25%, which he apparently referred to. For 2022, he referred to an 18.65% year-on-year change in June, while the 12-month average change for that same month was 16.54%.",14/09/2022,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/nigeriadecides2023-ruling-apc-party-chiefs-fall-flat-tv-claims-about-economy
"This is better than what you have in countries like the US, Canada, and Spain which are doing between a 7 to 10% increase in the inflationary rate.",Misleading,"Minister Keyamo said Nigeria fared better than countries like the US, Canada and Spain when it came to managing the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine. “Those countries are doing a seven to 10% increase in inflationary rate,” he said. In the US, the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimated 2020 annual inflation at 1.2%. In June 2022 it was at 9.1%, a sharp increase that has been widely reported on. The difference between 9.1% and 1.2% is 7.9 percentage points, and not 7.9%.  That’s not the only problem with this comparison. Tella, the economics professor, said some factors causing inflation were local and others global.  “It is not correct to compare inflation in Nigeria with that of the US and Canada,” he told Africa Check. This was because those countries had not had the same level of currency devaluation as Nigeria. They also had the capacity to produce more of what they needed. “But in Nigeria, we are mainly importing. We also import inflation.”  Tella also cited factors such as increasing interest rates and insecurity as local factors causing inflation. Flawed comparison Felix Onah is a professor of economics at Godfrey Okoye University in Enugu, southeastern Nigeria. He told Africa Check it was flawed to compare the average annual inflation rate to the monthly year-on-year inflation rate as they are computed using different methods. “The basis for comparison is not there. The composition of the items that are taken into account in finding the level of inflation may not exactly be the same in Nigeria and the US for example,” Onah said in response to our questions. “The minister is part of the government. He is defending his constituency because no government will want to appear bad.""",14/09/2022,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/nigeriadecides2023-ruling-apc-party-chiefs-fall-flat-tv-claims-about-economy
"The World Bank warned that several countries have debt crises. There were 25 African countries on the list, Nigeria was not there.",Misleading,"A debt crisis is when a country cannot repay its debt. It occurs when revenue earned by the country is lower than its expenditure for a prolonged period. Thirty-nine African countries were included on a World Bank list of countries that were at risk or already in debt distress as of March 2022. 13 countries were classified as being at moderate risk of debt distress 18 were high risk Seven were already in distress Therefore, 25 African countries were at high risk or were already in debt distress. Nigeria was not on the list as Keyamo claimed – but this was only because the bank considered low-income countries.  Nigeria is on the next rung, classified as a lower-middle-income country based on its gross national income (GNI) per capita. These countries have a GNI per capita of between $1,086 and $4,255. ‘GDP does not pay debts’ Akpan Ekpo is a macroeconomics professor and a former director of the West African Institute for Financial and Economic Management. He warned that Nigeria’s rising debt levels could be harmful. “To assure Nigerians, the government says the debt to GDP ratio is within sustainable limits but GDP is just about the value of goods and services produced. GDP does not pay debts,” Ekpo told Africa Check. “What pays debt is revenue. Take a look at Nigeria’s debt to revenue ratio and you will see that it is not sustainable. “It is not bad to take loans. However, loans must be taken to fund projects that can ultimately repay the loans. Nigeria should not be taking loans to fund recurrent expenditure like salary and pension payments.""",14/09/2022,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/nigeriadecides2023-ruling-apc-party-chiefs-fall-flat-tv-claims-about-economy
Lebanon had to borrow $150 million for food security. We have not borrowed for food security”,Incorrect,"In May, the World Bank approved a $150 million loan to the Lebanese government to import wheat and keep bread prices stable. While Nigeria has not borrowed to fund food imports like Lebanon, the government has received loans and grants to fund agricultural activities and enhance food security. An example is $500 million in World Bank funding to improve livestock production. In July 2022, the African Development Bank approved a $134 million loan for the Nigerian government to boost food production. In August, Nigeria’s agriculture minister Mohammed Abubakar listed six projects funded by international organisations to improve agriculture. ‘Nigeria cannot be said to have achieved food security’  “The definition of food security implies that a country has sufficient food supply for its citizens and the food must be generally agreed to be quality,” Jonathan Alimba, a professor of agricultural economics at the Ebonyi State University in Abakaliki, southeastern Nigeria, told Africa Check.  “The food must also be affordable. So food security is hinged on three things: quality, availability and affordability.”  “Nigeria cannot be said to have achieved food security. There are some instances where some food items are available in the market but citizens cannot afford them.” There were also Nigerians who could afford food but not of the right quality based on the internationally recognised nutritional requirements for a child or an adult, Alimba said. Insecurity was also partly to blame. “Farmers in some rural areas do not feel safe enough to go to the farms. If it isn’t attacks by bandits and insurgents, it is by herdsmen. The failure to secure lives and property has affected the country's food production.  “To transport food produced from the north to the south is a problem. Food may be available in the north but it is a challenge to bring it down south where it is needed.""",14/09/2022,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/nigeriadecides2023-ruling-apc-party-chiefs-fall-flat-tv-claims-about-economy
The level of antenatal clinic attendance in Nigeria is less than 60%.,Incorrect,"We have asked Aliyu for the evidence for the claims and will update this report with his response. The World Health Organization uses the availability of antenatal care as an indicator of access to healthcare during pregnancy. It says the antenatal period – conception to birth – is vital to the health of pregnant women and their infants. The most recent data on antenatal care in Nigeria is from the 2021 multiple indicator cluster survey (Mics) and national immunisation coverage survey (Nics).  It found that 70% of women aged 15 to 49 who had given birth in the five years before the survey received antenatal care from a skilled provider at least once in their most recent pregnancy. The survey, by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) and United Nations Children’s Fund (Unicef), was carried out across Nigeria from September to December 2021.

"Nigeria’s latest maternal mortality ratio is 512 per 100,000 live births.",Unproven,"The article attributes this stat to the 2018 demographic and health survey.  This interviewed 106,590 women, aged 15 to 49 and who had sisters, across the country. They were asked if any of their sisters aged 12 and above had died, and if the death had been pregnancy-related.  The study estimated maternal mortality at 512 deaths for every 100,000 live births in the seven years before the survey.  This means that for every 1,000 live births in Nigeria in that period, about five women died either during pregnancy, childbirth or within two months after giving birth. But this indicator is not captured in the 2021 Mics survey, the most recent.   A former director at the statistics bureau previously told Africa Check that they stopped recording maternal mortality due to persistent issues with sampling.",07/09/2022,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/fact-checking-four-claims-about-antenatal-care-and-pregnancy-related-deaths
"According to the WHO, the lifetime risk of a Nigerian woman dying during pregnancy, childbirth, postpartum or post-abortion is 1 in 22 …",Mostly correct,"We found the source as a 2019 World Health Organization article titled “Maternal health in Nigeria: generating information for action”. “A Nigerian woman has a 1 in 22 lifetime risk of dying during pregnancy, childbirth or postpartum/post-abortion,” it says.   But this data was dated, Ann-Beth Moller, a technical officer with the WHO’s sexual and reproductive health and research department, told Africa Check. “Please note the website reported old data,” she said. The article estimates Nigeria’s maternal mortality rate as more than 800 maternal deaths for every 100,000 live births. The most recent data was the trends in maternal mortality 2000 to 2017 report, Moller said. The report’s estimates are by the WHO, Unicef, the World Bank and other agencies. They put the lifetime risk of maternal death in Nigeria at one in 21, close to the older WHO estimate and the claim in Punch.  For a more recent estimate, we checked the 2018 Nigeria demographic and health survey (NDHS). This indicates that one in 34 women in Nigeria is likely to die from causes related to pregnancy and childbirth.  Why is this estimate lower than the WHO’s? A statistician at Nigeria’s data agency told Africa Check the NDHS estimate was based on the seven-year period preceding the survey and included more indicators.  The trends report’s estimates, on the other hand, were for 2017 only. There could be many reasons why Nigeria still has a high number of maternal deaths. Moller said women still had relatively low access to antenatal care, delivery by a skilled birth attendant, birth at a health facility, and care after birth.",07/09/2022,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/fact-checking-four-claims-about-antenatal-care-and-pregnancy-related-deaths

But he didn’t share any evidence for the claims.  The Medical and Dental Council of Nigeria, which regulates the professions of medicine, dentistry, and alternative medicine, acknowledged our request for data but had yet to respond at time of writing.  We then contacted the medical registries in the UK, United States and Canada to help us evaluate this claim. From 2016 to 2018, 1,600 doctors with a primary medical qualification from Nigeria joined the UK register for the first time with a licence to practise, the General Medical Council told us. “Please note that where a doctor gained their primary medical qualification is not a definitive indication of their nationality,” a spokesperson said. The Federation of State Medical Boards supports state medical boards in the US in licensing, disciplining and regulating doctors and other healthcare professionals.

Of these, 80% (887) were actively practising in the US as of 2018. Pei said that as of 2018, 3,708 Nigeria-educated doctors, with a total of 5,926 full active licences, were practising in the US. The Canada Medical Association was yet to respond on how many Nigerian-trained doctors migrated to the country in this period. But in a February 2022 report in Nigerian national newspaper Punch, the association said no fewer than 632 Nigeria-trained doctors were practising in Canada as of 2020.

"According to the World Health Organization, sub-Saharan Africa has about 3% of the world’s health workers.",Mostly correct,"The statement was from a 2010 document, the World Health Organization (WHO) told Africa Check. “We would suggest considering these [numbers] out of date,” a spokesperson said. The international health agency said the latest global and regional estimates were in the World Health Statistics 2021 report. According to the report, in 2018 the density of medical doctors per 10,000 people in the African region was 2.8. That of nurses and midwives was 10.3. The report did not have data on pharmacists and dentists. The WHO counts 47 countries in its Africa region.  Globally, the density of medical doctors, nursing and midwifery personnel was 56.5 per 10,000 population.  What figures from independent research show For a definitive figure of the region’s health workers, we turned to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME). The IHME is an independent global health research centre at the University of Washington in the US. It works with partners around the world to develop scientifically valid evidence on the global state of health.  Ally Walker, an IHME spokesperson, told Africa Check that it was estimated that sub-Saharan Africa had about 3.6% of the world’s health workers. “The percentage of health workers is taken from our health workers density covariate and our population estimates,” Walker said.

"Nigeria has a doctor-to-population ratio of about 1:4,000-5,000.",Understated,"Africa Check has previously investigated a similar claim. In April 2019 the Nigeria Medical Association said there were 40,000 doctors taking care of 200 million people in the country. This amounted to a ratio of one doctor to about 5,000 people. The Medical and Dental Council of Nigeria had earlier that year said 39,912 doctors were registered with it as of December 2017. This was in response to a freedom of information request by news publisher Premium Times. We have not seen any more recent data from the regulator. Nigeria’s most recent population estimates show there are significantly more people. The UN Population Fund estimated the population to be 216.7 million in 2022. This works out to a ratio of nearly one doctor for 5,400 people. A digital population census was supposed to start in May 2022, but it didn’t.

I established the Osun health insurance scheme.,Correct,"The bill to establish the health insurance scheme was passed by the state assembly in October 2018. It was signed into law by Rauf Aregbesola, Oyetola’s predecessor, also from the APC. However, its operations only started in April 2019, five months after Oyetola was sworn in. In March 2022, Adeoye Adelakun, the chair of the Osun Health Insurance Agency, told journalists that 206,659 residents have registered for the scheme.  This is under 5% of the state’s estimated population as of 2016. Tanimola Akande, a professor of public health at the University of Ilorin, in the country’s Kwara state described this sign up rate as “very poor”. “The global target is that everyone should have access to health services when needed without suffering financial hardship, so that coverage level is far away from the target,” he told Africa Check. Akande gave some factors for low coverage.  “Generally, Nigerians have a very poor attitude about insurance,” he said. “It is not necessarily the problem of affordability since Nigerians can afford to buy uniform outfits for parties known as asoebi [a type of African dress], they should be able to afford health insurance, that's my own view.” “Religion is also compounding the problem because people believe that they will not fall ill so why should they pay ahead for illness?” Akin Ogunbiyi - Accord Party",12/07/2022,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/osundecides2022-did-debating-governor-hopefuls-nigerian-state-get-their-facts

The 2016/17 Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey published by Unicef, the UN agency that focuses on the well-being of children, has data on out-of-school children. The survey sampled more than 37,000 households nationally. Results show that in Osun, 26.9% of children within the primary school age bracket did not attend school. This dropped to 10.5% among children within the secondary school age bracket. Besides the economic status of parents, there are other factors to blame for the problem of out-of-school children, according to Stephen Olubadewo.  He is a professor of educational administration at the Bayero University in Nigeria’s Kano state, with a focus on the relationship between parents’ economic status and the academic performance of students.  “Situations where facilities are inadequate or teachers are not well motivated also contribute to this problem,” he said.

igeria is now the poverty capital of the world,Incorrect,"In 2018, the Austria-based World Data Lab project sparked the now widely used narrative that Nigeria is the world’s “poverty capital”. Nigeria had overtaken India as the country with the largest number of extreme poor in early 2018, project researchers said, based on their World Poverty Clock data tool. “At the end of May 2018, our trajectories suggest that Nigeria had about 87 million people in extreme poverty, compared with India’s 73 million,” they said. But in June 2022, the clock estimated that 83.1 million Indians lived in extreme poverty, compared to 83 million Nigerians. (Note: You can get more details on how this is measured here.) The World Bank measures extreme poverty as the number of people living on less than US$1.90 per day. Based on absolute numbers, India has more poor people than Nigeria. Is there other data on this? In May 2020, the Nigeria Living Standard Survey estimated that 82.9 million people lived in poverty. But the survey, by the country’s data office, did not use the $1.90 poverty benchmark. The National Bureau of Statistics said it set the national poverty line at N137,430 a year or N376.5 a day. At the time, this translated to $353 per year or 97 US cents a day.  This has dropped to $313 per year or 90 US cents a day, based on the June 2022 official exchange rate, because of the devaluation of the naira. Comparisons require common benchmarks  Is it acceptable to call any country a “poverty capital”? We asked Ndiro Ayara, a professor at the University of Calabar in southern Nigeria. He researches poverty and economic development.  “It is possible to describe a country as the poverty capital,” Ayara told Africa Check. “That does not mean the country is the administrative headquarters of poverty. It just means that the country has the highest number of poor people.” He added: “For a human to live well and survive every day, he will need some basic things which are the same across the world, and these are food, water and shelter.  “We can compare two countries based on some economic indices. However this comparison should be done using common benchmarks, an example being the World Bank's $1.90 per day benchmark.""",07/07/2022,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/pdp-rescue-verifying-three-claims-about-terrorism-and-jobs-nigerias-main
igeria is the third most terrorised country in the world,Incorrect,"The Nigerian government defines terrorism, in part, as a deliberate act that may harm a person, country or an international organisation, or intimidate a population and destabilise a country. Internationally, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime defines it as a method of coercion that uses violence to spread fear and achieve set goals, whether political or ideological.  Nigeria is battling several security challenges. These include the Boko Haram terrorist group and its splinter faction the Islamic State in West Africa, clashes between farmers and herders, and banditry and kidnapping. One attempt to measure global terrorism is the Global Terrorism Index by the Institute of Economics and Peace (IEP), an international think tank headquartered in Australia. The index tracks 163 countries. To rank countries, it uses data on deaths, incidents, hostages and injuries from terrorism, weighted over five years. In its 2022 edition, the index ranked Nigeria the sixth most terrorised country. Afghanistan, Iraq, and Somalia were first, second and third. Do rankings reflect reality?  Confidence Isaiah-MacHarry, a security analyst at Nigerian research advisory firm SBM Intelligence, called for care when using external reports. “One must exercise caution when using reports by a lot of Western-based institutions and think tanks,” he told Africa Check. “You must look at their methodology and find out if they have people on the ground in the African countries they are reporting on.” The IEP’s only African office is in Harare, Zimbabwe. “Rankings are not necessarily a true reflection on the ground. For them to rank Nigeria sixth all the way from third [in the index for 2019], it may mean that some other countries have become a lot more terrorised than Nigeria.”  “But it does not feel that way internally given Nigeria's current security situation,” he quipped.  The link between insecurity and unemployment  There are various angles to the country’s insecurity challenges, according to Agagu Akinsola, a professor of political science at Ekiti State University in southwestern Nigeria. “We can partly attribute Nigeria's insecurity challenges to policy failure, especially in the areas of formulation and implementation,” he told Africa Check. “To solve Nigeria’s security challenges is a hydra-headed thing. Policies do not exist in a vacuum. Nigeria may formulate good security policies but other issues also need to be addressed. Take Boko Haram or banditry: some unemployed young people are readily available to take up arms.  “There is no way policy can deal with insecurity if people are not properly engaged and able to provide for themselves.” Agagu, who is currently researching conflict management in Nigeria, said religion and migration were other issues to consider.",07/07/2022,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/pdp-rescue-verifying-three-claims-about-terrorism-and-jobs-nigerias-main
Unemployment is about 35%.,Mostly correct,"The most recent official data shows the national unemployment rate was 33.3% in the last three months of 2020. This was 23.18 million people, the statistics agency said.  The labour force data was collected from 33,300 households in the country’s 36 states and the federal capital territory. The official data agency defines unemployment as where a person does not work at all, or works for less than 20 hours per week.  It also says underemployment is when an individual works for at least 20 hours a week but for less than 40 hours. Underemployment is also when a person works a job that underutilises their skills or educational qualifications. According to the data, 22.8% of Nigeria’s working population were underemployed at the end of 2020. In absolute numbers, this was 15.9 million people out of a workforce of 69.7 million.  Together, 39.1 million people were either unemployed or underemployed. Leaders must recognise ‘there is a problem’  Kayode Omojuwa is a professor of political science at the Ahmadu Bello University in Kaduna, northwestern Nigeria. He focuses on party politics in Nigeria’s democratic process. “In an ideal society, these issues of unemployment, poverty and even insecurity should be the focus during an election season. People should strive towards making political leaders accountable but that is not the situation now,” he said.  “A large percentage of Nigeria’s young population is helpless and unemployed which can lead to unrest, the type witnessed during the EndSARS protests.

he Nigerian government has budgeted N4 trillion for the fuel subsidy in 2022,Correct,"After the January 2022 decision to continue the subsidy, president Muhammadu Buhari asked for more funds to support it.   In April, federal legislators approved the request, increasing the subsidy budget from N442.72 billion to N4 trillion, or nearly 10 times more. The initial figure had been approved for the first six months of 2022. The country’s finance minister attributed the sharp increase to the rise in oil prices caused by the conflict in Ukraine. Fuel subsidy a ‘criminal enterprise’?  Subsidy fraud has been another key concern.  “The main problem is that there is no accurate way of knowing how much fuel we consume in this country,” Sheriffdeen Tella, a professor of economics at the Olabisi Onabanjo University, Ago-Iwoye in southwest Nigeria, told Africa Check. “In many cases, marketers exaggerate the volume of fuel imported, falsify documents to collect subsidies for fuel they didn’t import and sometimes present fuel refined as imported fuel.” Nigeria’s junior minister of petroleum, Timipre Sylva, has gone so far as to describe the fuel subsidy as “a criminal enterprise”.  Tella said he believed the government should end the subsidy “right away”. “The extra funds the government is earning due to the rise in the oil price can be used to cushion the impact of the subsidy removal.""",28/06/2022,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/checking-three-claims-about-nigerias-ever-controversial-fuel-subsidy

igeria can build a refinery as big as the Dangote refinery this or every year,Incorrect,"Because its main refineries are in various states of disrepair, Nigeria imports nearly all the petroleum products it consumes, after exporting large volumes of crude oil to refineries in other countries. But it would be incorrect to say the Nigerian government could build a 650,000 barrels-per-day petroleum refinery in a year with the subsidy amount, Ekpen Omonbude, an energy and mineral resources economist, told Africa Check. “It’s impossible to build that kind of refinery in a year. N4.1 trillion cannot build a 650,000 barrels-per-day petroleum refinery. It will cost a lot more than that,” he said. “It is also not that simple. Beyond building it, the operations also require funds. With a growing deficit, the Nigerian is not in a good position to do this.” Omonbude added that money allocated to repairing the refineries had “gone down the drain”, so they were “still far from working efficiently”.  Construction of the Dangote refinery began more than seven years ago, in 2015. Its refining capacity is more than all of Nigeria’s five refineries put together. (Note: for more on the state of these refineries, read our factsheet.)  Dangote refinery ‘not the answer’ to fuel subsidy  Tella, the economist, agreed. He told Africa Check public funds shouldn’t be used to build large refineries. “Definitely, N4.1 trillion cannot build [another] Dangote refinery. But it might be sufficient to build smaller refineries, like the modular refineries. However, if the government builds refineries it should partner with the private sector,” Tella said. Omonbude warned that the Dangote refinery was not the answer if the goal was to maintain the country’s current low pump price of fuel.  “The Dangote refinery is a business. It will buy crude at global market price and it still will not be able to sell at the current price of petroleum motor spirit [petrol] without a subsidy,” he said.",28/06/2022,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/checking-three-claims-about-nigerias-ever-controversial-fuel-subsidy
" Nigeria Centre for Disease Control study shows that over 50% of Nigerians have been exposed to the virus, and have antibodies for Covid-19",Incorrect,"The journalist who wrote the article told Africa Check the claim came from a Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) study. He said he had also quoted Dr Chinwe Ochu, who leads the centre’s prevention programmes and knowledge management.  In February 2021 the NCDC and its partners released the findings of a survey done in four states. This seroprevalence study sought to find the real extent of coronavirus infection in Nigeria, the researchers said. “Results coming in show that over 50% of the population have antibodies for Covid-19, meaning that they have been exposed to the virus,” the analysis quoted Ochu as saying.   Study of Covid burden ‘still ongoing’ But Dr Yahya Disu, the NCDC’s head of risk communication, told Africa Check that Ochu had not made a conclusive statement about the survey’s results. “The study is still ongoing,” he said. “It has been conducted in only about six states and the results vary significantly.

"In other words, over 50% of Nigerians have survived the virus …",Correct,"We do not have data that supports the paper’s estimate of 50%. But even if this share were accurate, does it mean that half of Nigerians have survived Covid-19, as the Guardian asserted? This was accurate, Mirabeau Tatfeng, a professor of medical microbiology and immunology at Niger Delta University, told Africa Check. “The presence of antibodies is evidence that the person was exposed to the virus and if the person didn’t die, it means they survived it, whether the person was ill or asymptomatic,” Tatfeng said. He said NCDC records for example indicated a survival rate of over 80%, with about 3,000 deaths from 250,000 cases. Studies have shown that many cases were not reported, and that testing was low in Nigeria, with only 5 million samples tested for an estimated population of 216 million.  But Tatfeng added that many studies had not included children, so their results might not apply to all Nigerians. Interpreted directly, this claim by the Guardian is correct.  All the experts did however warn that the presence of antibodies didn’t mean a person couldn’t be infected in the future. Antibodies ‘wane over time’, don’t guarantee protection  “Only those who were down with Covid-19 to the extent of getting hospitalised would develop strong antibodies,” Tomori said. “But then antibodies wane over time. That you have developed antibodies does not mean you will always be protected from the virus.” But a high level of antibodies could reduce the severity of infection.   Also, most of the people exposed in Nigeria were asymptomatic, professor of public health Tanimola Akande told Africa Check. In an April 2022 statement the WHO said this was the picture across Africa. The antibody levels of asymptomatic patients “may not be high enough to prevent infection among them”, Akande said. “It is therefore important for people to take the necessary doses of vaccination.” By 7 May 2022 only 14% of Nigerians – 16 million – had been fully vaccinated. Across Africa, the figure is less than 15%. Tomori added that the prevalence of antibodies should not be interpreted as herd immunity in Nigeria as this was “complicated”.  Herd immunity is the indirect protection from an infectious disease when a population is immune either through vaccination or immunity developed from previous infection.",12/05/2022,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/do-more-half-nigerians-have-covid-19-antibodies-newspaper-claimed-study-didnt
he Buhari administration established “a social protection scheme that is the largest in sub-Saharan Africa”,Mostly correct,"The BMO said that even though Nigeria earned less from the global economy under Buhari, his administration had still set up a social protection scheme that was the “largest” in sub-Saharan Africa.  Social protection policies aim to cushion individuals and households against possible hardships by, for example, protecting them from shocks like lost or reduced income.  BMO chairperson Niyi Akinsiju confirmed that they had made the claim. He told Africa Check they had specifically meant the National Social Investment Programme (NSIP) the Buhari government set up in 2016.  The NSIP has four arms:  N-Power, which aims to support the youth  A school-feeding programme  A programme providing cash to the poor and vulnerable A micro-lending programme The programmes are managed by the humanitarian affairs, disaster management and social development ministry. More than 22 million beneficiaries  At least 22.7 million people have so far benefited from the programmes. That’s according to publicly available data, the most recent from January 2022. It includes ministry statements that say 9.8 million pupils have benefitted from school feeding since 2015. In January 2022, the National Cash Transfer Office said 1.9 million poor and vulnerable households had registered for conditional cash transfer. The National Bureau of Statistics estimates the average Nigerian household to be five people, which means 9.6 million people were registered. Leo Sanni, a statistical information officer at the bureau, said this way of calculating the total was correct.  The table has more details.",03/05/2022,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/checking-three-claims-pro-buhari-group-about-outgoing-nigerian-presidents
Over 12 million households have benefitted from the National Social Investment Programme in the past five years.,Misleading,"The figure came from news reports on the humanitarian affairs ministry’s activities, BMO chair Akinsiju told Africa Check.   He added that it included estimated beneficiaries of Covid-19 relief programmes. We found a news report quoting Bashir Nura Alkali, the ministry’s top civil servant, as saying over 12 million households had benefitted from the NSIP.  But Alkali’s reported breakdown actually worked out to 10.3 million people and a million households, not the over 12 million households given in the headline and claimed by the BMO.  Olasupo Ogunjuyigbe is a professor of demography at the Obafemi Awolowo University in Ile-Ife in the southwestern state of Osun. He said it was incorrect to pass off individual beneficiaries as households. “They have misconstrued this and taken it to mean that if you give an individual something, that individual will take it back to their household but that is wrong. If a household benefits from a programme, you are likely to know how many members are in the household.” Some civil society organisations also argue that the government’s Covid-19 relief should not be counted as being part of the NSIP. ‘Get microfinance banks involved’  Samuel Nzotta is a professor of banking and finance who researches microcredit and poverty reduction at the Federal University of Technology, Owerri in Imo state, southeastern Nigeria. He told Africa Check that while social investment such as microcredit – extremely small loans – has been shown to help the poor, in Nigeria it was not well structured and was “heavily politicised”. One way to correct this would be to channel the programmes through microfinance banks, and not traditional banks as is currently the case, Nzotta said.  “The programmes should not be limited to one administration. Get microfinance banks involved and set up a monitoring mechanism so that the interventions do not die with the administration or else poverty will never be addressed in Nigeria.” Nzotta added that there was also a need to properly identify the beneficiaries. “Are they really poor? Can they facilitate production at that meagre level and expand their capacity?""",03/05/2022,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/checking-three-claims-pro-buhari-group-about-outgoing-nigerian-presidents
Nigeria now produces 9 million metric tonnes of rice today compared to 2 million metric tonnes in 2015.,Exaggerated,"Nigeria consumes more rice than any African country and is one of the biggest producers and importers of the grain on the continent. That’s according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations. But it does not grow enough.  To reduce its dependence on imports and bridge the gap, the country has attempted to increase local production. In 2015, the central bank launched an anchor borrowers programme to provide cheap loans to farmers. Akinsiju told Africa Check that the BMO was referring to paddy rice and their data came from news articles about the Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria. Paddy is harvested rice grain that is still inside the husk. The husk is removed during milling. The FAO estimates that Nigeria produced 6.2 million (not 2 million) metric tonnes of paddy rice in 2015 and 8.1 million tonnes in 2020. In June 2021, Aminu Goronyo, the head of the rice producers, reportedly said Nigeria’s annual rice production was 9 million tonnes. The central bank also used this figure, in January 2022. There is evidence that Nigeria currently produces 9 million tonnes of rice, but the BMO underestimated the amount produced in 2015. This exaggerates the improvement under Buhari.  Low rice production leads to smuggling  Because Nigeria does not produce enough rice, smuggling has taken root over the years. To fight this, the federal government shut its borders with neighbouring countries in August 2019. They were reopened in December 2020. Smuggling has many consequences for Nigeria's economy, Igbatayo Samuel, professor of economics at Afe Babalola University in Ekiti state, told Africa Check.  “Rice smuggling and even legal importation of rice are synonymous with exporting jobs from Nigeria to other countries,” he said. “There are a lot of people that can be employed within the rice value chain from those who will clear the land, plant, weed, harvest, mill, package and distribute the finished product. But when rice is imported, those jobs have been transferred to the countries exporting to Nigeria.""",03/05/2022,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/checking-three-claims-pro-buhari-group-about-outgoing-nigerian-presidents
N55.3 trillion was allocated to the education sector by the federal government between 2016 and 2021.,Incorrect,"The newspaper claimed that from 2016 to 2021, it was “reported” that Nigeria’s government allocated N55.3 trillion to the education sector. We sent an email to Business Day asking for the source of their data and to clarify some of the claims. We will update this report with their response. Documents from the Budget Office of the Federation, however, show far less than this amount was set aside for education in this period. The figures cover statutory transfers under the country’s universal basic education (UBE) programme, in addition to recurrent and capital expenditure allocations by the education ministry and its affiliated agencies. The first nine years of education in Nigeria are free and compulsory and are funded under the basic education programme. The table below shows the funding budgeted for the six years under review.",06/04/2022,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/nigerias-education-system-dire-grading-claims-business-day-editorial
"Less than 10% of the funds allocated to education in the period, representing N3.5 trillion, had been given to the sector.",Incorrect,"Business Day went on to say that less than 10% of the N55.3 trillion it claimed had been budgeted for education was eventually spent on the sector.  It gave this figure as N3.5 trillion, suggesting a gulf between what was budgeted and what was eventually released.  Budget implementation documents for the years of interest suggest otherwise. They show that for each of the years from 2016 to 2021, 100% of the amounts earmarked for the UBE programme were released.  The share of the capital budget released also exceeded 50% in all the years, rising to more than 100% in 2020. The percentage of the education budget released to the sector was significantly more than 10%.",06/04/2022,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/nigerias-education-system-dire-grading-claims-business-day-editorial
"In Nigeria’s 2022 budget of N17.13 trillion, only a paltry 7.2% is allocated to the education sector.",Mostly correct,"The editorial said the education sector’s share of Nigeria’s 2022 budget was 7.2%. This works out to N1.23 trillion, of a total of N17.13 trillion. It said that an international agreement in 2021 committed countries to spend at least 15% of public funds on education. The available data shows that the budgetary allocation to education in 2022 is in fact slightly lower. The 2022 appropriation act published by the Budget Office of the Federation shows that N593.47 billion was allocated to the education ministry and its agencies for recurrent expenditure, and N159.66 billion for capital projects.  N112.29 billion was also earmarked for basic education and N306 billion to the Tertiary Education Trust Fund.  This adds up to N1.17 trillion, or 6.83% of the total budget.  However, finance minister Zainab Ahmed’s public presentation of the approved 2022 budget had the total allocation to education as N1.23 trillion, which is 7.2% of the total budget – what the paper claimed.  The disparity was because the budget presentation document gave a total of N815.69 billion while the figures in the appropriation act added up to N753.13 billion. But the paper’s overall argument of low funding holds, as analysts told Africa Check. Inadequate funding severely affects teacher morale The continuously poor funding of education has “grave implications” for the country, according to Comfort Edemenang. He is professor of educational administration and planning at the Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University in Bauchi, northeastern Nigeria.  He gave universities as an example. “Sometimes there is no power or water supply for several days. There is poor infrastructure and both lecturers and students are demoralised. Many want to go abroad.” Nigeria’s education indices from primary to tertiary level are poor, Sidiqat Ijaiya, professor of education management at the University of Ilorin in northern central Nigeria, told Africa Check.  He also linked this to the inadequate funding of education. “A major impact is poor infrastructure. Due to the lack of basic laboratory equipment, we do alternatives to practicals in secondary schools. There is also a lack of equipment in universities.” Lecturers struggled to remain motivated and often downed tools, Ijaiya said. In February 2022 lecturers went on strike, with better funding of universities one of their demands.  “It’s not just about increasing lecturers’ pay, it’s about infrastructure and teaching aids,” Ijaiya said.",06/04/2022,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/nigerias-education-system-dire-grading-claims-business-day-editorial
"In 2021, there were 25 attacks on schools. 1,440 children were abducted, and 16 children were killed.",Mostly correct,"We traced this claim to a November 2021 press release by the Nigeria office of the United Nations Children’s Fund (Unicef). But the statement didn’t include the number of schoolchildren killed in the 25 attacks. We found a death toll of 16 in an earlier Unicef press release, dated 16 September 2021.  “So far this year, there have been 20 attacks on schools in Nigeria, with 1,436 children abducted and 16 children dead. More than 200 children are still missing,” it said.  The numbers were from geopolitical intelligence firm SBM Intelligence, said Folashade Adebayo, a spokesperson for Unicef Nigeria.  “In their methodology, they utilise a dual approach. Firstly, they work within a research network that collates information on school attacks in the course of tracking electoral violence and other indicators. Then whatever report is collected is independently verified. Only verified information is reported,” Adebayo said in an email.  She said “17 learners were reported to have lost their lives in 2021” and there was a possibility some attacks went unreported. A December 2021 report by human rights organisation Amnesty International described some of the attacks on schools and schoolchildren in Nigeria in 2021.  The report stated that over 780 were abducted for ransom in 2021 and over 61 were still in captivity months after their abduction. It however provided no death toll.

CT contributes more than oil and gas to Nigeria’s economy,Correct,"The outsized influence of fossil fuels in Nigeria’s economy continues to be debated. Is the ICT sector changing this?  According to the reporting in the Daily Post, Abdullahi said that ICT now contributes more to Nigeria’s gross domestic product than oil and gas. A country’s gross domestic product or GDP is the measure of the size of its economy. It is the market value of all goods and services produced in a country in a given period, usually a year. Any economic activity will increase GDP - as long as the activity is recorded.  Nominal GDP includes inflation, the increase in prices of goods and services over time, while real GDP presents economic growth with inflation removed. According to the  International Monetary Fund, real GDP figures “allow us to see whether the value of output has gone up because more is being produced or simply because prices have increased”. What does the data show? Nigeria’s bureau of statistics publishes quarterly GDP figures. Its definition of the ICT sector includes telecommunications and information services, publishing, motion picture, sound recording and music production and broadcasting. The agency’s most recent GDP data covers the fourth quarter of 2021. In that period, ICT contributed 15.2% to real GDP. In the previous quarter, the share was 14.2%. Oil and gas in turn contributed 5.19% and 7.49% to gross domestic product respectively.",02/03/2022,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/verifying-nigeria-ict-heads-claims-about-sectors-contribution-nigerias-economy
"Today, ICT is contributing 17.93% of GDP”",Mostly correct,"The most recent GDP figures from the statistics office cover October to December 2021. They show that the ICT sector’s contribution to real GDP was 15.21%.  It seems Abdullahi had referred to the sector’s contribution in the second quarter, April to June 2021, which was 17.92%.  The increase in ICT’s contribution to Nigeria’s economy is due to the global rise in digital technology, Sheriffdeen Tella, a professor of economics at the Olabisi Onabanjo University, Ago-Iwoye, south-west Nigeria told Africa Check. “Nigeria’s ICT sector has been growing significantly in the past two decades. The use of mobile phones to access the internet and perform many tasks is on the increase globally, not just in Nigeria. But that is the main driver of the growth in the country’s ICT sector,” he said.  Pandemic accelerated sector’s growth Both Njiforti and Tella said that expansion in Nigeria’s ICT sector is part of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. “The Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated the growth in the ICT sector. Due to restrictions on movement and gathering, people resorted to virtual communication and transactions,” Tella said.  “In fact, I believe the contribution of ICT to Nigeria’s GDP is underestimated. Apart from the direct contribution of the sector, there are indirect contributions such as trade facilitation. Virtually every other sector uses ICT.""",02/03/2022,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/verifying-nigeria-ict-heads-claims-about-sectors-contribution-nigerias-economy
"efore this [Buhari’s] administration, ICT was contributing less than 5% of GDP",Incorrect,"The Daily Post reported Abdullahi as saying that before president Buhari’s administration, “ICT was contributing less than 5% GDP, today ICT is contributing 17.93% GDP.”  However, an assistant corporate affairs director at the agency, Abdul Qadir Apaokagi, told Africa Check that his boss was misquoted.  “What the director general said was that ICT contributed less than 0.5% to the GDP before the creation of Nitda.  Apaokagi said statistics to this effect were in the public domain, including online and from the National Bureau of Statistics.

Africa Check confirmed the quote was edited and replaced with Nitda’s version. The original version can be read here.     Experts advised we work with real GDP to evaluate this claim. Buhari took office in May 2015. ICT’s contribution to GDP ranged from 10.89% in the first quarter of 2014 to 11.47% in the first three months of 2015.

"China owns around 72% of Kenya’s external debt, which stands at US$50 billion.",Incorrect,"We contacted Ventures Africa for the source of this figure, and they sent us a link to an article first published in September 2021 by the Economic Times, an Indian business news platform. The best data to verify this claim was the national treasury, John Kinuthia told Africa Check. He is a senior programme officer with the Kenya office of the International Budget Partnership, a global budget transparency organisation. He directed us to the most recent quarterly economic and budgetary review, covering July to September and published in November 2021. It showed the country’s total external debt at $36.7 billion. Prof Deborah Brautigam is director of the China Africa Research Initiative at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Washington DC in the US. She has written extensively about China in Africa. “These figures from the article are not correct,” Brautigam said.  She suggested we look at World Bank data.

"According to Kenya’s auditor general, the country may lose Mombasa port if it defaults on loan repayment.",Correct,"We contacted the office of Kenya’s auditor general to ask about this claim.  Peter Opiyo, the agency’s deputy director for communications, referred us to its audit report of the Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) for the financial year 2017/18. The authority manages the country’s seaports. The report revealed that KPA’s assets and revenues had “expressly guaranteed the repayment of the loan amounting to KSh363.96 billion financing the standard gauge railway”.  The railway is Kenya’s most expensive infrastructure project. Snaking from Mombasa to Kenya’s capital Nairobi, it was built through Chinese funding. But the actual contract has remained under lock and key, with government officials reportedly saying its disclosure could “undermine national security”. The audit cited a payment arrangement agreement in which the port authority agreed to “irrevocably waive any right of immunity” in “any proceedings against it or any of its present or future assets”. “Kenya Ports Authority assets are exposed to risk of takeover by the lender,” the auditor general’s report said. The auditor general also pointed out that the agreement was “unfavourable” to Kenya, because it directs that all unresolved disputes involving the Export-Import Bank of China (Exim) be settled in Beijing, China.  Uganda, Kenya’s eastern neighbour, has also seen avid debate about its main airport, should the country default on its debt to China.

"igeria has one of the worst indicators of maternal mortality in the world, second to China",Mostly correct,"Maternal mortality refers to deaths due to complications from pregnancy or childbirth or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Okonofua told Africa Check he had been misquoted but has yet to provide us with the evidence for his claims. We will update this report once we receive a reply. He said: “Nigeria has one of the worst indicators of maternal mortality in the world, second only to India.” Ann-Beth Moller is a technical officer at the WHO’s sexual and reproductive health department. She referred us to the organisation’s trends in maternal mortality report for 2000 to 2017. The report showed that in 2017 Nigeria had the highest number of maternal deaths in the world, at 67,000. The estimate was based on sources such as civil registration and vital statistics systems, population-based household surveys and specialised studies.  (Note: Experts have told us that data on maternal mortality in Nigeria remains unreliable.) India came second to Nigeria with 23,000 maternal deaths, while China recorded 4,900. When maternal mortality rates, per 100,000 live births, were considered, Nigeria was fourth, after South Sudan, Chad and Sierra Leone.

igeria has the highest rate of abortion in the world,Unproven,"The headline of the Nation article also claimed that according to Okonofua Nigeria had the highest rate of abortion in the world. Another newspaper reported Okonofua saying this was 45 “illegal abortions” per 1,000 women. The professor told Africa Check he had again been misquoted. “Nigeria has one of the highest rates of unsafe abortion in the world,” he said. Abortion is illegal in Nigeria and can result in a jail sentence of up to 14 years. It is only allowed if done to save the life of a woman. The WHO’s Moller told Africa Check that the international health agency would soon publish country-level estimates. “But currently, I can’t confirm the statement,” she said. Dr Oluwatosin Wuraola Akande is a public health physician and lead author of a 2020 journal article on unsafe abortions in Nigeria. She said she doubted the claim was correct. Akande referred us to a global factsheet on unintended pregnancy and abortion which covered 2015 to 2019. It is compiled by the Guttmacher Institute, a US-based research and policy institute for sexual and reproductive health. The factsheet is based on a study of unintended pregnancy and abortion trends published in the medical journal the Lancet. According to the factsheet, western Asia and northern Africa had the highest abortion rate, at 53 induced abortions per 1,000 pregnancies, followed by central and southern Asia with 46 abortions per 1,000 pregnancies.  It listed a rate of 33 per 1,000 for sub-Saharan Africa.

he fertility rate of women in Niger is 7.5%,Incorrect,"The commissioner’s office confirmed he had been accurately quoted. They promised to send us the sources of the data and we will update this report when we hear back.  Dr Jumoke Ogunro, a consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist, advised us to focus on the total fertility rate in order to fact-check the claim. Ogunro is also a member of the board of Ask The Paediatricians Foundation. The WHO defines the total fertility rate as the average number of children a group of women would have over the course of their reproductive lives. The reproductive period is defined as 15 to 49 years. (The full definition can be read here.) What the most recent data shows The most recent data on fertility state-by-state is from the 2018 demographic health survey, published in October 2019 by the National Population Commission and the United Nations Population Fund, among others. Demographic health surveys are conducted every five years. The 2018 survey found that the total fertility rate for Niger state was 5.8 children per woman. The 2013 edition of the survey found it to be 6.1. The survey interviewed 41,821 women across the country from August to December 2018. They were asked about their birth history in the three years leading up to the survey. Other reliable data sources are:  The 2018 Statistical Report on Women and Men in Nigeria, produced annually by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). It found Niger’s total fertility rate to be 6.4 that year. (Note: The 2020 report does not include this information.)    The 2016/17 multiple indicator cluster survey by the NBS and the United Nations Children’s Fund. This also found Niger state’s total fertility rate to be 6.4 children per woman.  Rate could be higher due to teen pregnancy The total fertility rate is usually simply described as the average number of children per woman, which makes it an intuitive measure of fertility, Ogunro told Africa Check. She said there was every possibility Niger’s total fertility rate could have increased because girls in the state still married young. According to the demographic survey, 26.1% of women aged 15 to 19 in the state had already begun having children. “However, since we are scientists, it is better to do things based on available data rather than make projections based on certain indices,” Ogunro said.

"In the last decade, before the advent of the present administration, Nigeria was on the index.",Incorrect,"At the policy dialogue, Malami said that Nigeria had been on the impunity index “in the last decade” before president Muhammadu Buhari came to power in 2015. We’ve asked the justice ministry to clarify what time frame he was referring to and will update this report with their response. Buhari’s administration replaced that of the Peoples Democratic Party, which had been in power since 1999. Contrary to Malami’s claim, Nigeria was on the index in the first four years of Buhari’s term. In 2015, the country ranked 13th of 14 countries on the index. It also featured every year from 2016 to 2019. The CPJ started compiling the index in 2008. Nigeria first featured in 2013, only falling out for the first time in 2020.  “The absence of Nigeria on our impunity index in 2020 and 2021 have nothing to do with alleged actions taken by the Nigerian government,” Jonathan Rozen, a senior researcher with CPJ’s Africa Program, told Africa Check. Nigeria’s absence is purely a function of the fact that the index is based on the last decade, a 10-year window that crawls forward with time, he said. For example, beginning in 2020, the murder of journalist Bayo Ohu in 2009 fell outside of this window.  “Only those nations with five or more unsolved cases in the 10-year period are included on the index, so the removal of Ohu’s killing from that window reduced the number of murders calculated and caused Nigeria to fall off the index. This fact was also noted in the 2020 impunity index report,” Rozen said.  For its index, the CPJ calculates the number of unsolved journalist murders as a percentage of each country’s population. Murder is defined as the deliberate killing of a specific journalist in retaliation for the victim’s work. (Note: For more on the methodology used in the index, read here.) At least 12 Nigerian journalists have been deliberately killed for their work between 1992 and 2021, the watchdog’s records show.   ‘Some cases go unreported’   Some cases of assault, harassment, illegal detention and murder of journalists go unreported, Shuaibu Liman, the national secretary of the Nigerian Union of Journalists, told Africa Check.  “The impunity index does not fully capture the current experience of Nigerian journalists. Some cases are not reported. Virtually all cases of murder of journalists, all the way from the murder of Dele Giwa in 1986, are still unresolved,” he said.",10/12/2021,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/nigerias-absence-global-impunity-index-evidence-better-press-freedom-and-human
Nigeria ranked between 12th and 13th across the globe and used to be among the top three African countries with impunity for crimes against journalists only after Somalia and South Sudan.,Misleading,"This claim does not paint an accurate picture of the index.  Rozen said the index includes only countries with five or more unsolved cases over 10 years and the ranking is only of countries that fit these parameters, and not of all countries.  Since it started in 2008, the index has not had more than 14 countries in any edition. In that inaugural list, Sierra Leone and Somalia were the two African countries of the 13 that were included. Nigeria first made the index in 2013, when it was 11th of 12 countries, with Somalia the other African country featured. In 2014 Nigeria was 12th of 13 countries and 13th of 14 countries in 2015, when South Sudan first appeared on the index. Second index ranks Nigeria low   Though not on CPJ’s most recent index, Nigeria was ranked 120th of 180 countries in the world in the 2021 world press freedom index compiled by Reporters Without Borders.  Some of the countries with the lowest press freedom scores such as Eritrea, North Korea, Turkmenistan, China and Djibouti are not on the impunity index.  Rozen explained that while CPJ documents different forms of attacks on journalists and other actions that affect press freedom, it uses only its record of unresolved journalist murders to inform its index.   “The impunity index is a specific metric used to illustrate the absence of efforts to hold accountable those responsible for the murders of journalists around the world,” he said. Malami’s claim excluded the fact Nigeria came 12th and 13th among less than 15 countries. Therefore, we rate the claim as misleading.",10/12/2021,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/nigerias-absence-global-impunity-index-evidence-better-press-freedom-and-human
"As far as African countries are concerned, it is only Nigeria that has been taken off the impunity index.",Incorrect,"This claim made during the December 2021 TV interview is also not supported by the available evidence. According to Rozen, it is not correct to make this kind of comparison, as the index includes only countries that meet the specified criteria, and not all African countries.  The first two editions of the index in 2008 and 2009 had two African countries: Sierra Leone and Somalia. Sierra Leone dropped off the index in 2010 and has not returned.  Somalia was the only African country on the index from 2010 until 2013 when Nigeria was first included. South Sudan then made the list in 2015. The three countries were the only ones from Africa in the index until 2020 when Nigeria fell off.  Considering that Nigeria is not the first African country to drop off the index and that only two African countries were left on the index after Nigeria fell out, we rate the claim as incorrect.",10/12/2021,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/nigerias-absence-global-impunity-index-evidence-better-press-freedom-and-human

These include buying vaccines through international vaccination programmes such as Covax and the African Vaccine Acquisition Trust. But have 5 million Nigerians received a Covid-19 vaccine jab? Data from the National Primary Health Care Development Agency, the organisation in charge of giving the vaccines, shows that 1.79 million Nigerians had received the second dose, and were considered fully vaccinated, by 21 September 2021.

"In the northeast region alone, over 8,000 Boko Haram terrorists have surrendered.",Mostly correct,"Nigeria has weathered a 12-year running battle with Boko Haram insurgents. More recently, since 2015, this conflict has been mainly confined to the northeastern part of the country. (Note: See our factsheet for more information on the terrorist organisation and its violent insurgency.) In 2015, Buhari ran for the presidency with an election promise that “no force, external or internal, will occupy even an inch of Nigerian soil”.   Despite the gains claimed by Buhari, the group (which has now splintered) has carried out coordinated attacks on military formations. It has also taken over entire local councils and collected taxes from residents and farmers. In September 2021, the commander of a military unit said 8,000 insurgents had surrendered to the army.   Abdulwahab Eyitayo, an acting general officer commanding, said most of the insurgents who surrendered were the wives and children of terrorists, or had been forcefully recruited. ‘Not time to celebrate yet’ Taking 8,000 insurgents into custody was at best a temporary gain, security expert Vitus Ukoji told Africa Check.  Ukoji is the project coordinator at Nigeria Watch, which monitors lethal violence, conflicts, and human security in the country. He said the number was likely accurate but warned that the terrorist group still posed a threat.  “It’s really not time to celebrate because Boko Haram is still recruiting. Poverty and high youth unemployment are drivers. There is also the suspicion that some of the insurgents that surrendered are not genuinely repentant,” he explained.  “Assimilating them could harm society. It took several years to radicalise these insurgents. It would take a lot more than a six-month programme to deradicalise them.""",12/10/2021,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/nigeria-61-checking-president-buharis-2021-independence-day-claims
"Our unrelenting effort at resolving an almost two-decade stalling on the management of our petroleum resources and ensuring equitable consideration to our host communities has resulted in the enactment of the Petroleum Industry Act, 2021.",Correct,"Since Nigeria’s return to democracy in 1999, successive governments have tried to develop new legal, regulatory and institutional frameworks for the oil and gas industry.  In 2000, the Oil and Gas Sector Reform Implementation Committee was created to transform the industry. Four years later it drafted a national oil and gas policy. Parliament approved the policy in 2007. A year later it had morphed into the Petroleum Industry Bill but it was only passed in July 2021.  Buhari signed the bill into law in August. It provides the legal, governance, regulatory and fiscal framework for the industry and the development of host communities. The law is expected to transform the sector by encouraging investments, stimulating focus on midstream operations, and improving the funding potentials for joint venture oil projects, Adewale Ajayi says in a report analysing the legislation’s potential.

Our economic diversification strategy remains on course with the persistent increase in non-oil sector contribution to GDP.,Incorrect,"Gross domestic product (GDP) is a measure of the size of a country’s economy. It is the market value of all goods and services produced in a given period, usually a year. Data from Nigeria’s National Bureau of Statistics shows that the non-oil sector’s contribution to GDP has fluctuated between 89% and 94% since 2014. Buhari became president in May 2015. In that quarter (April to June), the non-oil sector contributed 90.2% to GDP. It rose to 91.94% of GDP at the end of that year and then dropped to 89.98% in the first quarter of 2016.  From 2016 to the end of 2020, the sector's contribution to GDP fluctuated almost every quarter, as can be seen in the graph below.

The agricultural sector [contributed] 22.35% and 23.78% to the overall GDP in the first and second quarters of 2021.,Correct,"Buhari said agriculture remained key to his administration’s “economic diversification efforts”.  The sector did indeed make up 22.35% of GDP in the first quarter of 2021, and 23.78% in the second quarter.   The statistics bureau presents sectors’ contributions to GDP in two ways. One is oil and non-oil. The other is agriculture, industries and services. GDP data shows that agriculture has consistently contributed over 20% to GDP at least since 2012, three years before Buhari became president in 2015.  In the past five years, agriculture’s contribution to GDP has been the second largest. Services have consistently led with over 50% for at least the past decade.

The water projects we completed between 2015 to 2020 have improved Nigeria's access to potable water to 71% between 2015 and 2020.,Misleading,"Buhari claimed that his administration had increased the proportion of people with access to potable water. The WHO defines “potable water” as safe drinking water that  “does not represent any significant risk to health over a lifetime of consumption”. Nigerian law requires that all water supplies intended for human consumption must comply with the Nigerian Standards for Drinking Water Quality. These limit the concentration of substances known to be health hazards, or likely to be the subject of complaints from consumers.  Among other things, drinking water acceptable by law in Nigeria should not be contaminated by E coli and other bacteria commonly found in faeces.  The water standards were developed by the water resources ministry, the health ministry and the Standards Organisation of Nigeria.  Basic drinking water vs safely managed water   We traced Buhari’s figure of 71% to a 2019 report on progress on household drinking water, sanitation and hygiene from 2000 to 2017 jointly produced by the World Health Organization and Unicef.  The report says the share of Nigerians with access to at least basic water supplies rose from 48% in 2000 to 71% in 2017.   The WHO and Unicef define basic drinking water as “drinking water from an improved source, provided collection time is not more than 30 minutes for a round trip, including queuing”.  Improved sources include piped water, boreholes or tube wells, protected dug wells, protected springs, rainwater, and packaged or delivered water, according to the report.  But it also says the percentage of Nigerians with access to “safely managed water” rose from 15% in 2000 to 20% in 2017.  The report defines safely managed water as “drinking water from an improved source that is accessible on premises, available when needed and free from faecal and priority chemical contamination”.  Transporting water may lead to contamination  The 2021 edition of the report looks at worldwide changes in drinking water, sanitation and hygiene from 2015 to 2020.  For Nigeria, access to at least basic drinking water supplies rose from 69% in 2015 to 78% in 2020. Access to safely managed water rose from 20% in 2015 to 22% in 2020. Both basic and safely managed drinking could be considered potable water, Auwal Bappa, a water, sanitation and hygiene consultant with Unicef in northern Nigeria, told Africa Check.  “The ultimate goal is safely managed water but basic drinking water is also acceptable. Both are safe,” he said.  “The main difference is that a basic water supply is located outside the home and so there is a higher chance of contamination in the course of transportation. However, the water fetched from a distance can still be treated at home. So both basic and safely managed can be considered potable water.”  Most water projects not by government Buhari’s statistic about access to potable water is accurate but his claim that government water projects drove the increase is misleading.  A 2019 survey by the water ministry, the statistics bureau, Unicef and other organisations found that federal, state and local governments provide less than 30% of all water points in Nigeria.  The report says “about 70% of all community water points are provided by non-government actors”.  Water, sanitation and hygiene expert Priscilla Achakpa told Africa Check that civil society and private individuals were largely responsible for access to drinking water across Nigeria. Achakpa is the founder and global president of the Women Environmental Programme. She was the national coordinator of the Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council from 2017 to 2020.    “The majority of water projects in the country are done by NGOs or private individuals, and they are mostly boreholes. This is the situation in both rural and urban areas,” she said. “I know that not many Nigerians drink water supplied by government agencies.""",12/10/2021,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/nigeria-61-checking-president-buharis-2021-independence-day-claims
This means 12.5 million additional Nigerians now have direct access to potable water.,Understated,"The 2021 report on progress on household drinking water, sanitation and hygiene, jointly produced by WHO and Unicef, provides figures for Nigeria’s access to basic and safely managed drinking water in 2015 and 2020.  It uses 181.14 million as Nigeria’s population estimate in 2015, with 206.14 million in 2020. Some 69% of people had access to basic drinking water in 2015, according to the report. This comes to about 124.98 million people. In 2020, access to at least basic drinking water had risen to 78%, or 160.79 million people.  This means about 35.8 million more Nigerians gained access to at least basic drinking water from 2015 to 2020.

The National Home Grown School Feeding Programme is currently being implemented in 35 states of the federation and the FCT.,Mostly correct,"The National Home Grown School Feeding Programme was launched in 2016. Led by the government, it seeks to improve the health and education of children in public primary schools with N70 a day (around $0.17 at the time of publishing). Nigeria has 36 states, plus the federal capital territory (FCT).  But despite the success of the feeding programme in 34 states and the FCT, Kwara and Bayelsa states are yet to implement it.  In 2020, Kwara expressed interest in joining the programme and was even recorded as the 35th state to join, but hasn’t rolled it out yet.  ‘N70 daily is not enough’ Oriyomi Ogunwale, project lead at Eduplana, told Africa Check that while the claim was correct, there was a need to review the programme. “N70 is not enough, and it has never been enough,” he said. “It should be increased to N200 or more. But we should not just focus on increasing the amount. We should look into monitoring and evaluation. There should be transparency and accountability.” Eduplana is a civic tech organisation that uses data to advocate for quality education in Nigeria.

The World Health Organization defines maternal death as any death of a woman during pregnancy, childbirth or up to 42 days after birth. These deaths exclude accidents.  “Unsafe abortion is a procedure of pregnancy termination either by persons lacking the necessary skills or in an environment that does not conform to minimal medical standards or both,” the WHO says.   Salami told Africa Check that the Daily Trust quoted him correctly. He referred us to Nigeria’s national guidelines on safe termination of pregnancy for legal indications, published by the federal health ministry in 2018. The guidelines say unsafe abortion “alone” accounts for “about 10 to 14 % of maternal morbidity and mortality in Nigeria”. Africa Check asked the ministry for the source of the statistic.

He also said it was more accurately 576 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births. The survey is conducted every five years– most recently, in 2018. “Maternal mortality continues to be a serious problem in Nigeria,” the 2018 survey notes.   For the survey, 106,590 women aged 15 to 49 who had sisters were interviewed across the country from August to December 2018. They were asked if any of their sisters aged 12 or above had died, and if the death had been pregnancy-related.  The study estimated maternal mortality at 512 deaths for every 100,000 live births in the seven years before the survey.  This means that for every 1,000 live births in Nigeria in that time, about five women died during pregnancy, during childbirth or within two months after the birth.",28/09/2021,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/health-check-unsafe-abortion-and-maternal-mortality-nigeria

he residency programmes in Nigeria can't accommodate all the graduates,Mostly correct,"Resident doctors are medical school graduates training to become specialists. In the US, their training period came to be called a “residency” because they mostly lived in the hospital. In Nigeria, 163 public and private hospitals are approved for the residency programme. These have 13,118 slots available for both junior and senior residents. Getting a limited residency placement involves a highly competitive written examination. Uyilawa Okhuaihesuyi is the president of the Nigerian Association of Resident Doctors. He told Africa Check that bottlenecks in the system meant some doctors do not get slots. “We have a strength number of 17,000 and many of them are leaving in droves to Saudi Arabia, UK and the US,” he said. Those who left were not replaced. One reason for this was a requirement that hospitals seek approval before employing a resident doctor, Okhuaihesuyi said.  Some 2,285 students graduated in medicine in 2019, official data shows. A 2018 survey of Nigerian doctors also identified difficulties in getting residencies as a key obstacle. “Most doctors interviewed indicated that securing a residency position was even more difficult than securing an internship position which is already considered quite challenging,” the survey says.

It added that 91,079 medical and dental practitioners have been registered with the council from its inception in 1963 to December 2017. Licences granted by the council have to be renewed annually. The Nigeria Medical Association (NMA), in turn, says it has over 40,000 members in Nigeria and about 19,000 abroad. The professional body has had this number since 2017, it told Africa Check, because getting an exact number “has been a challenge because of the flow of doctors out of the country”. In March 2020, a health ministry official said the number of registered medical doctors in Nigeria was at 74,543 as of December 2018.

igeria has one of the highest birth rates in the world,Correct,"Otitoju said Nigeria needs doctors to cater to its large population and high birth rate, which he said was one of the highest in the world. The nationally representative 2018 Demographic Health Survey put the country’s crude birth rate at 38 births per 1,000 population. This was higher in rural areas, at 42 births per 1,000 people, than in urban areas, which had an average of 34 births per 1,000 residents. The World Bank estimated Nigeria had 37.4 births per 1,000 people in 2019, against a global average of 18 births per 1,000 people. Niger, Chad, Somalia, Congo, Mali and Angola had the highest birth rates, with more than 40 births per 1,000 people. Nigeria’s birth rate is high because contraceptive use is low, Audu Idrisa, a professor and consultant obstetrician at the University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital in Nigeria’s northeastern state of Borno, told Africa Check.

"igeria spends close to 3% to 3.5% of GDP on healthcare, while South Africa spends 8.25% and Kenya spends 5.2%",Understated,"According to World Bank data, Nigeria spent 3.89% – not 3.5% – of its gross domestic product (GDP) on healthcare in 2018. This is the bank’s most recent available data.  In comparison, Kenya’s healthcare spending was 5.17% of GDP, and South Africa’s 8.25%.  The World Bank’s figures come from its global health expenditure database.    Why does it matter? The WHO says current health expenditure as a share of GDP is an important measure. “It shows the importance of the health sector in the whole economy and indicates the societal priority which health is given, measured in monetary terms.” In 2001, African Union members agreed to commit at least 15% of their annual budgets to health. The declaration was signed in Abuja, Nigeria’s capital city.  By 2011, only Tanzania had reached the target. Botswana, Rwanda, Madagascar, Togo and Zambia achieved it in 2013 and Swaziland got there in 2015. Nigeria’s health sector ‘underfunded’ “There is no country that can develop if the citizens are not healthy so we have to see health as a priority but that is not the case with Nigeria,” Tanimola Akande, a professor of public health at the University of Ilorin in western Nigeria, told Africa Check. “The country where the Abuja Declaration was signed has not achieved the 15% budgetary allocation target since the agreement was signed. The funding available for health in Nigeria is horrible.”  Akande added: “We also have the national health act which says 1% of the consolidated revenue fund will be used to fund healthcare.

here are more than 100 pupils to every one teacher in Nigerian schools,Unproven,"The large under-15 population and the high demand for learning opportunities meant it was difficult for Nigeria to offer quality education, Utomi argued.  This, he said, meant there were “more than 100 pupils for one teacher” in the country’s schools. But he did not clarify if the ratio was for public schools or if private schools were included. The federal Universal Basic Education Commission (UBEC) has 2018 data on the ratio. It gave the national average as 31 pupils to a teacher, worsening to 49 when only qualified teachers were considered.  The data covered six years of primary school and three of junior secondary, which are considered both free and compulsory. ‘Nigeria has not submitted recent data’ The Institute for Statistics (UIS) is the official statistics agency for the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (Unesco). Its most recent data showed there were about 58 pupils to every qualified teacher in 2013. “There is no recent published data for Nigeria for pupil-teacher ratios because the country didn’t recently submit the necessary data to calculate these indicators,” Bertrand Tchatchoua, an adviser at the UIS, told Africa Check. Comfort Edemenang is a professor of educational administration and planning at the Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University in Bauchi in northeastern Nigeria. She told Africa Check that in some public primary schools in the north, a teacher was handling more than 100 pupils, sometimes up to 150. “But this is not the case in private schools where you would normally find between 35 and 40 pupils in a class,” Edemenang said, noting that she could not speak to the situation in southern Nigeria.  “But generally, when you have such situations where a teacher is faced with over 100 pupils, the quality of education is eroded.”  The basic education commission’s data for 2018 shows ratios of more than 80 pupils to one teacher in some geopolitical zones in the country.",03/08/2021,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/100-pupils-teacher-fact-checking-widely-read-claims-about-education-nigeria

ost of the states could not draw from this fund as they could not match the funding,Correct,"The basic education fund gets guaranteed funding from the federal government, in addition to donor grants. For any of Nigeria’s states to qualify for the guaranteed funds, the law requires it to contribute at least 50% of the total cost of identified projects, such as classrooms and laboratories, as a commitment that they will be completed. Utomi claimed that most states in Nigeria did not access these federal funds because their governments were unable to meet their end of the deal. Oriyomi Ogunwale, who is the project lead at Eduplana, a civic technology organisation that uses data to promote quality education in Nigeria, told Africa Check how it worked.  “For a state to access the universal basic education fund, the state government approaches the Universal Basic Education Commission with a proposal for projects that would improve access to basic education.”  “A needs assessment is done and the state commits to providing half of the budget and then UBEC would provide the other half.” States not accessing funds, governors want law changed The most recent data on the commission’s website shows that in 2019, about N614 million was earmarked for each of the 36 states in the country and Abuja, the federal capital territory. As of July 2019, none of the states had accessed the fund, while at least 19 had not accessed 2018 funding. In April 2021, the commission’s executive secretary Hamid Bobboyi said it had about N41 billion in matching grants that hadn’t been accessed. State governors have over time shown they are unwilling to provide matching funds, and have pushed for changes to the law to remove or reduce the percentage states have to provide, Ogunwale said. A recent example was by the chairperson of the Nigerian Governors’ Forum, Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti state, in March 2021.",03/08/2021,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/100-pupils-teacher-fact-checking-widely-read-claims-about-education-nigeria
nly 4% of Nigerians have access to healthcare insurance,Mostly correct,"We asked Osita Nwanisobi, the bank’s acting director for corporate communications who read the speech, for the specific World Health Organization (WHO) study referred to. We will update this report with the response. According to the WHO, health insurance is when contributions are made by individuals or groups to organisations that buy specified health services on behalf of the members.  Nigeria’s national health insurance scheme (NHIS) defines it as a system designed to pool funds to buy and provide access to quality and affordable personal healthcare services for every Nigerian. How many Nigerians are covered? The WHO however does not have data on how many Nigerians are covered by health insurance, spokesperson Andrei Muchnik told Africa Check. In 2018, former NHIS executive chairperson Yusuf Usman was quoted saying that more than 90% of Nigerians who were eligible were not insured by the scheme. We were however unable to get more data from the NHIS. The 2018 Demographic Health Survey, a nationally representative survey,  does have data on health insurance coverage. It estimated a coverage rate of 3% (3.4% in men and 2.6% in women) in a sample of 55,131 people aged 15 to 59. There were also regional differences. The southwest geopolitical region recorded a coverage rate of 3.3%, followed by the southeast, at 3.2%. The northeast region had the lowest, at 1.2%. Respondents were asked if they belonged to mutual health organisations or community-based health insurance (such as state-run schemes), employer-based health insurance, social security or other privately purchased commercial insurance. People delay treatment because of costs Affordability and low knowledge of how the scheme works are factors for this low coverage rate, Michael Asuzu, a professor in the college of medicine at the University of Ibadan in southwestern Nigeria, told Africa Check.  ""So people delay going to the medical centres because they do not want to pay from their pockets. They stay at home trying to manage high blood pressure until it results in stroke.”  Asuzu said having wide health insurance coverage would increase awareness and consequently the use of these services.",09/06/2021,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/nigerias-central-bank-governor-money-about-health-insurance-and-out-pocket
ut-of-pocket expenses on healthcare amounted to close to 76% of total healthcare expenditure,Mostly correct,"The WHO defines out-of-pocket payments as direct payments made by individuals to healthcare providers at the point of care each time a person is sick. Data from the international health agency shows what countries spend on health, and what different actors such as the government, insurance companies, households and donors contribute. As of 2018, out-of-pocket expenses accounted for 76.6% of current health expenditure in Nigeria. This is the cost of healthcare services, not counting capital spending on buildings and the like. These payments have increased from 71% in 2015 to 77% in 2017, the data showed.   Out-of-pocket expenses can be financially ruinous This trend is unlikely to reverse quickly, Tanimola Akande, a professor of public health at the University of Ilorin in Kwara state, central Nigeria, told Africa Check. “Let’s paint a scenario. If someone is to go for a caesarean section and the bill is N150,000 (about US$365) and the person is earning N30,000 ($73), Nigeria’s minimum wage, it can be very difficult to raise that amount,” he said. If this person took out a loan, they would be pushed into significant financial problems, Akande said. Universal health coverage was supposed to fix this, he added.  Universal health coverage – UN sustainable development goal In 2015, United Nations member countries agreed to push for universal health coverage by 2030. This was listed as part of its sustainable development goals. Universal health coverage seeks to make sure that people have “access to quality essential health services; safe, effective, and affordable essential medicines and vaccines; and protection from financial risk”. The target is to reduce out-of-pocket health expenditure to about 32% in member countries. But Nigeria is way off achieving this, experts told Africa Check, with low spending on health by the government being a factor. African governments agreed in 2001 to devote 15% of their budgets to healthcare. Nigeria has not achieved this since. “So the government is not spending enough and people are not insured enough and the funding must come from somewhere. That is from the individual who is sick and is why the figure [of 77%] is very high,” Akande said.",09/06/2021,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/nigerias-central-bank-governor-money-about-health-insurance-and-out-pocket
 Unicef report showed that Nigeria has the second highest burden of stunted children globally,Correct,"Africa Check reached out to both Sanwo-Olu’s media team and Cecilia Mabogunje, the director of a children’s hospital in Lagos who delivered the speech, for more details about the source of the claims. We will update this report with their response. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines a burden as the impact of a health problem on a population. This can include death or the loss of health and is a useful measure to compare countries, the organisation says. Stunting occurs when poor nutrition impairs the growth and development of children. A child is considered stunted if their height is lower than would be statistically expected for their age. Does the most recent publicly available data show Nigeria has the second highest burden of stunted children globally?  The speech attributed this claim to a “Unicef report”. Africa Check traced it to a country summary on nutrition by the UN agency, which works to help children. For percentage of child population stunted, Nigeria comes 5th, not 2nd Helen Wylie, a Unicef spokesperson, referred us to the global database on child growth and malnutrition. This is maintained by the agency together with the WHO and the World Bank. The joint malnutrition estimates were most recently updated in April 2021. They show Nigeria has the second highest burden of stunted children worldwide, with about 12 million children under five, behind India’s 36 million. Children under five have the highest burden of disease due to malnutrition, or the inadequate, imbalanced or excessive consumption of energy. When stunting is considered as a share of the population of children, Nigeria’s proportion is 35%, fifth after countries such as Burundi (57.6%), Eritrea (49.1%) and Niger (46.7%).",18/05/2021,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/well-known-nigerian-doctor-correct-about-malnutrition-women-and-children
Nigeria has] a national [stunting] prevalence of 32% for under fives,Mostly correct,"According to the WHO, prevalence measures the amount of disease in a population at a period in time. It is often expressed as a percentage or number of cases per population. The joint estimates show that in 2020, the stunting prevalence for Nigerian children under five was 35.3%. This figure is “slightly different” from the 32% in the database as “we now use a country-level model”, Helen Wylie of Unicef told Africa Check. The model does not yet account for Covid-19, she said.  Nigeria’s Demographic Health Survey for 2018 also has data on stunting. The survey examined the height and weight of 12,695 children under five and estimated a prevalence rate of 36.8% (39.4% in boys and 34.2% in girls).  There are also regional differences, with some northern states having as much as 60% stunting, while those in the south had figures as low as 14%.",18/05/2021,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/well-known-nigerian-doctor-correct-about-malnutrition-women-and-children
bout two million children in Nigeria suffer from acute malnutrition,Mostly correct,"Acute malnutrition, also referred to as wasting, is characterised by a rapid deterioration in nutritional status over a short period of time. Wasting statistics are usually expressed for children under age five. Estimates show that in 2020, some 6.5% of Nigerian children in that age group suffered from wasting.  Unicef did not yet have a country model for wasting as it did for stunting and overweight, spokesperson Wylie told Africa Check. She added that applying the 6.5% estimate to the population under five for the survey year yields about two million children. Nigeria’s population figures are contested and there isn’t a recent breakdown of these by age groups. Emmanuel Aguwa is professor of public health at the University of Nigeria in the southeastern state of Enugu. He said that the figure for acute malnutrition would have increased due to health crises, insecurity and insurgency in some parts of the country. “The truth is that it is difficult to get accurate figures,” Aguwa said. Michael Asuzu, a professor at the college of medicine at University of Ibadan, also agreed that the figure was likely higher “considering all that has been happening in the country in the past few months”.  “Two million is sort of a benchmark; the figure could be more,” said Asuzu, whose research areas include epidemiology, occupational health and health policy. Dr Mary Stephen, a technical officer at the WHO Africa regional office, told Africa Check: “It is possible the figure has increased. Usually, in emergency situations, the rate of malnutrition increases because of food insecurity.”",18/05/2021,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/well-known-nigerian-doctor-correct-about-malnutrition-women-and-children

The WHO and Unicef said they had no data for this claim, as specific interventions vary in countries. According to Unicef, foods that are high in energy, fortified and ready to eat are suitable for treating severely malnourished children.  Prof Tanimola Akande, a public health physician and epidemiologist at the University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital in western Nigeria’s Kwara state, said the claim could be correct for some parts of the country.  “The health-seeking behaviour of mothers and level of access to care are contributory. Health facilities caring for malnourished people are rare in rural areas,” he said.

The women were asked about their weight and body mass index.  The UN and Nigeria’s government will in September 2021 launch the Food Systems Summit Dialogue which aims to tackle hunger and malnutrition in the country.

here are an estimated 39.6 million Twitter subscribers in Nigeria,Incorrect,"We have asked both sides for the evidence for their claims, but neither has responded yet. We will update this report when they do. The PDP claimed there were about 39.6 million Twitter “subscribers” in Nigeria. It argued that this figure was bigger than Ghana’s population, so Nigeria should have been picked. But do the numbers add up? Before 2019 the microblogging platform reported on its monthly active users, with the last reported figure being an average of 326 million for July to September 2018. The company now reports on “monetisable daily active usage” (mDAU). Twitter also defines subscription differently. It is reportedly exploring a service where users would pay for certain types of content.   Nigeria not in top 20 of Twitter user countries  A spokesman for Twitter, Gareth Field, told Africa Check the firm does not disclose country user data externally.  But others have tried to keep track. Research firm Statista says that in January 2021, Twitter had 353 million monthly active users. The US had the most, with 69.3 million active Twitter users.  Nigeria is not in Statista’s top 20. Malaysia is 20th, with 3.4 million active users. Statista says its data is sourced from Twitter and the third party companies DataReportal, We Are Social and Hootsuite. In a 2021 digital report, social media management firm Hootsuite estimates Nigeria has 33 million active social media users. Twitter is the sixth most used platform, behind WhatsApp, Facebook, YouTube, Instagram and Facebook Messenger.  Hootsuite says a Twitter ad in Nigeria has a potential audience of 3.05 million people. But it adds that audience figures “may not represent unique individuals or match the active user base”. The firm says its data was gleaned from several third party providers, including Statista, GlobalWebIndex, GSMA Intelligence, Statcounter and Alexa.

igeria has become the world poverty capital under the APC’s watch,Misleading,"The PDP said that the ruling party had done little to improve a worsening economy, making many Nigerians poorer. In 2018, Nigeria was declared the “poverty capital” of the world when the number of its people living in extreme poverty, defined as less than US$1.90 a day, exceeded those in India. This was based on data from the World Poverty Clock developed by the World Data Lab, a research firm focused on the UN’s sustainable development goals. As of March 2021, about 717 million people lived in extreme poverty globally, the clock showed, with 89.8 million of them in Nigeria. This is 43% of the country’s estimated 209.7 million in 2021.   Is the ruling party to blame? The PDP was in power from 1999 to 2015. It blamed president Muhammadu Buhari and his APC for the state of the economy. But poverty in Nigeria was due to the actions of successive governments since the country’s independence in 1960, Gafar Ijaiya, professor of economics at the University of Ilorin in north central Nigeria, told Africa Check. Ijaiya, who is currently researching poverty, said the country’s high poverty rates had built up gradually. Agricultural output and many industries – such as steel and textiles – had declined, he said, while inequality had also grown.  “Should we be surprised that there are so many living in extreme poverty in the country? It didn’t start in 2018. Yes, the APC is to blame, but the PDP is also to blame,” Ijaiya told us.  “Economic research takes a long time, especially on issues such as poverty, which is micro-economics and affects individual households. It’s a trend; you can’t single out one regime.""",06/05/2021,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/twitter-opts-ghana-office-nigerias-top-political-parties-cast-blame-did-they
uhari’s administration has continued to bring woes … with an escalated 33% unemployment rate,Correct,"The PDP correctly quoted Nigeria’s most recent unemployment rate published by the National Bureau of Statistics.  Bureau data for March 2021 puts the unemployment rate at 33.3% in the fourth quarter – last three months – of 2020.   The country’s workforce — people aged between 15 and 64 who are able and willing to work —  was estimated to be about 69.7 million. The rate means that about 23.2 million of the workforce did not work that quarter. Jobless graduates  The high unemployment rate means the Nigerian economy is not absorbing all of the graduates from tertiary institutions such as universities and polytechnics. That’s according to Pam Dung Sha, a professor of political economic and development studies at the University of Jos in north central Nigeria. “For instance, in the context of employment, Twitter setting up in Ghana is a missed opportunity for Nigeria,” Sha told Africa Check. “Twitter having its Africa headquarters in Nigeria would have brought jobs and businesses. The setting up of such big firms in a country has multiplier effects.""",06/05/2021,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/twitter-opts-ghana-office-nigerias-top-political-parties-cast-blame-did-they
ver 40 million hitherto vibrant businesses have closed,Unproven,"Is it possible that more than 40 million thriving businesses in Nigeria have closed shop in the past six years of APC rule, as its rival claimed?  It is unlikely the “vibrant businesses” the PDP referred to were registered.  This is because the Corporate Affairs Commission, which is in charge of listing businesses, announced in March 2019 that it had registered only 3.1 million businesses since its inception in 1990. These are registered in any of three categories: limited liability companies, business name, and incorporated trustees. The 2017 micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSME) survey shows the country had 41.54 million small businesses. These were defined by how many people they employed and the value of their non-property assets. Of these enterprises, 41.47 million or 99.8% were micro, 71,288 were small and 1,793 were regarded as medium. A full 97.8% of micro enterprises were not registered. No data on closure of unregistered businesses  Without data there’s no way to prove that some 40 million Nigeria-based businesses have closed in the past six years, Sha told Africa Check. “Nigeria, like most developing countries, has a large informal sector. Getting data for the informal economy is difficult. I know that many businesses have closed and some have left the country for Ghana and other destinations, but many businesses have also started here or come into the country.”  Ijaiya agreed that data was needed. “It is true that businesses have closed for different reasons. But to put a number to it, we need a properly done survey.”    We therefore rate the claim as unproven.

ultinational technology companies Facebook and Google have opened in Nigeria and the world’s largest brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev and multinational food manufacturing giant Kellogg’s have established their multibillion-naira brewery and factory in Nigeri,Mostly correct,"The APC said that Twitter’s decision was its own to make and other tech giants were opening offices in the country. The ruling party’s statement then name-checked some that have chosen to do business in Nigeria.  In September 2020 Facebook announced that it was opening its second African office in Lagos, Nigeria. While Google’s Nigeria office predates the Buhari and the APC government, the tech giant did announce in January 2020 that it was opening a developer space in Lagos, its first in Africa.  In 2017, Anheuser-Busch InBev announced it was investing US$250 million in a new brewery in southwest Nigeria. It had earlier acquired SAB Miller Nigeria, which owned three breweries. That same year, Kellogg Tolaram Nigeria Limited, a joint venture between the US-headquartered Kellogg company and the Tolaram group of Singapore, opened a cereal factory in the Lekki Free Trade Zone in Lagos.

But Nigeria was officially declared Africa’s largest economy in 2014 when the country’s statistics office adjusted how it calculated its gross domestic product, a widely used measure of the size of an economy. “The previous base year was 1990. This meant that sectors such as the film industry, Nollywood, and mobile telecommunications that rose after that year were not counted,” Dr Baba Madu, head of national accounts at the National Bureau of Statistics, told Africa Check. “The rebasing exercise began in the current base year, 2010 and was concluded in 2013.

griculture accounts for almost 50% of the Nigerian economy,Incorrect,"We asked the publication for the source of its numbers and will update this report with their response. Data on agriculture’s share of the economy can be found in the quarterly gross domestic product (GDP) updates and other reports published by the National Bureau of Statistics, Willie Okowa told Africa Check.  He is professor of development economics at the University of Port Harcourt in Nigeria’s southern Rivers state. “Agriculture contributes much less than 50% of the GDP,” Okowa said, but asked us to check the bureau’s data for the exact share. The most recent quarterly report covers the last three months of 2020. The statistics office has two ways of measuring how different sectors contribute to the GDP:  All sectors are divided into the oil and non-oil sectors.   All sectors are divided into agriculture, industries and services.   Using the first approach, oil contributed 5.87% of the “real” GDP – where inflation has been accounted for. The non-oil sector accounted for 94.13%. Under the second method, agriculture accounted for 26.95%, industries 18.77% and services 54.28%. This pattern was the same when the entire year was considered, at 26.21% for agriculture, 21.36% industries and 52.44% for services. Historical data from the statistics agency shows that agriculture has not contributed 50% to GDP over the past 10 years. In 2010 the sector contributed 40.87%, and this has declined since.  Processed agricultural products count to ‘industries’ GDP contribution  Dr Baba Madu, who heads the agency’s national accounts division, told Africa Check that in the bureau’s GDP calculation, agriculture-related industries are not counted as agriculture.  “We consider agriculture as the production of raw food or livestock, like raw cassava, maize or animals. Once any of this is processed and a product is made out of it, it then counts as industries. For instance, suya and flour are not counted as agriculture,” Madu said. (Suya is a spicy grilled beef kebab.) This means a fraction of the contribution of industries to the GDP is agriculture-related. However, even if those were added to agriculture’s contribution, it would still not reach 50%. Youth leaving agriculture for services sector The drop in agriculture’s contribution to GDP is partly due to a decline in agricultural activities and a boom in the services sector, Ndem Ndiyo, professor of economics at the University of Calabar in southern Nigeria, told Africa Check. “We have left agriculture to the elderly. Most of the young men just want to go to school, get a certificate and find a job in the services sector,” he said.

he national prevalence of caesarean section delivery in Nigeria is about 2.1%,Mostly correct,"A caesarean section is the delivery of a baby through a surgical incision in the mother’s abdomen and uterus. Some caesarean deliveries are planned, but  many are done when complications arise during labour.  The study quoted by Punch is a secondary analysis of the 2013 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey, published in the open-access BMJ journal.  The nationally representative survey collected data on 31,868 live births in the five years preceding the survey, from mothers aged 49 and younger. It was conducted from February to May 2013 and found the prevalence of caesarean section delivery to be 2%.  The 2018 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey, the fifth of such surveys, is the most recent. It collected data on 34,193 live births and found the prevalence of caesarean section delivery to be 2.7%, which it rounded up to 3%.  There were regional differences in caesarean rates. They were higher in urban (5%) than in rural areas (1%). The lowest rates were in the North West and North East regions at 1%, and highest was in the South West at 7%. When states are considered, the rate was as high as 13% in Lagos and less than 1% in Zamfara, Sokoto, Kebbi and Yobe. Caesarean rates vary widely by community As the demographic health survey is community based, it normally finds lower caesarean rates than an institution-based survey, Mairiga Abdulkarim, professor of reproductive health at the University of Maiduguri, in northeastern Nigeria, told Africa Check. “Any survey that focuses on deliveries at medical facilities will get significantly higher rates of caesarean sections. At the University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital the rate is up to about 12% and it is even higher in some other university teaching hospitals,” she said. One reason for this was that teaching hospitals detect complications earlier and recommend a caesarean section, Abdulkarim said. And because they have the expertise, they also handle patients with complications referred from other health facilities.   Rates rise with access to information The 2017/18 Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey found a similar rate for caesarean sections. Of women aged 15 to 49, who had their most recent live birth in the previous two years, 2.8% had delivered by caesarean section.  This survey was done from September 2016 to January 2017 by Nigeria’s national bureau of statistics and other organisations such as Unicef and the WHO.  But the current prevalence of caesarean sections in Nigeria should be higher than 3%, according to Uchenna Onwudiegwu, professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at the Obafemi Awolowo University at Ile-Ife in southwestern Nigeria.  His experience was that Nigerians were now more open to the surgery as they were better informed about it. “However, mostly in the rural areas, caesarean section is considered a failure of womanhood. So women risk their lives to have a vaginal birth.” However, more women are having the surgery for elective reasons such as to avoid labour pains or ensure their child is delivered on a specific date, Onwudiewgu told Africa Check.",12/03/2021,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/are-caesarean-sections-nigeria-far-below-international-rate-newspaper-claimed
he WHO recommends a caesarean section threshold of 10%,Incorrect,"Has the international health agency specified such a standard? It is not correct to say that the WHO has recommended a threshold for caesarean section rates, Elizabeth Noble, information officer at the WHO’s sexual and reproductive health and research department, told Africa Check. “The WHO does not recommend a threshold for caesarean sections at population level. Every effort should be made to provide caesarean sections to women in need, rather than striving to achieve a specific rate,” she said. Many documents on caesarean section rates make reference to a statement by reproductive health experts at the 1985 conference on appropriate technology for birth in Brazil, partly organised by the WHO. The experts unanimously adopted several recommendations. One was that “there is no justification for any region to have a [caesarean] rate higher than 10 to 15%.” Following two wide surveys carried out by the organisation, the WHO released a new statement on the caesarean rate in April 2015. The statement  noted that one of the studies showed that “below a caesarean section rate of 10%, maternal and neonatal mortality decreased when caesarean section rates increased. As caesarean section rates increased above 10% and up to 30% no effect on mortality rates was observed”. Noble said the reference to 10% in the statement does not amount to a recommendation by the WHO. “In the latest statement on caesarean section rates, the WHO does not adopt any caesarean section rate as ‘ideal’ or ‘optimal’. The threshold of the 10% was found for the association between caesarean section and maternal and newborn mortality,” she said. ‘Recommendation’ from 1985 shouldn’t be globally applied Noble said that due to a lack of data at population level, the “association between caesarean section rates on other outcomes, such as maternal and perinatal morbidity, paediatric outcomes, and psychological or social well-being could not be determined”.  More research is therefore needed. The health agency noted that the 1985 panel’s conclusion was “drawn from a review of the limited data available at the time, mainly from northern European countries that demonstrated good maternal and perinatal outcomes with that rate of caesarean sections.”  The WHO’s recommendations on non-clinical interventions to reduce unnecessary caesarean sections, published in 2018, also noted that the rise in the non-medical use of the procedure is a universal problem. These also state that “the ideal or optimal caesarean rate is unknown”.

"owever, 2018 saw a new spike in cervical cancer deaths to 10,403, a 70% mortality rate",Unproven,"Using 2018 data, the HPV Information Centre factsheet found that “every year 14,943 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer and 10,403 die from the disease”. The mortality rate for cervical cancer was therefore about 72%. However, Barango described the claim as misleading. He said he would rather use the word “increase”. “It would be wrong to say there was a spike if we don't have access to previous data. To ascertain that there was a ‘new spike’, we would need to ensure that the same methodology and scrutiny was used for a number of years in the collection of data around cervical cancer. “The increase in cervical cancer deaths could have been due to better collection of data. If in previous years, due to poor data collection, Nigeria recorded 1,000 cervical cancer deaths, we can’t say there is a spike now if Nigeria recorded 10,000 cervical cancer deaths.” Experts have also previously told Africa Check that the observed numbers are linked to the number of deaths, not the risk of dying from cervical cancer. There was also increasing awareness of the disease and therefore more people were being screened.

here are over 15 million Nigerians in the diaspor,Unproven,"Africa Check has asked Prompt for evidence of its claims. They haven’t responded, but we’ll update this report if they do.  “The term ‘diasporas’ has no set definition, and its meaning has changed significantly over time,” says the International Organization for Migration, an agency with 173 member countries.  But it does then define diasporas, as “migrants or descendants of migrants, whose identity and sense of belonging have been shaped by their migration experience and background”. Remittances, the IOM says, are “financial or in-kind transfers made by migrants to friends and relatives back in communities of origin”. The World Bank says remittances supplement household incomes, improving welfare and reducing poverty.  Incomplete data   The United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs’ (Desa) most recent estimate of Nigeria’s diaspora is 1.7 million as of June 2020.  The estimate appears in Desa’s International Migration 2020 Highlights report, published in January 2021. The report adds that India has the world’s largest diaspora population, of 17.8 million.  To make the estimates, Desa used population censuses, registers and nationally representative surveys. (Note: For more on how international migration is measured, see here.) The estimates also come from empirical data on country of birth or of citizenship reported by countries or areas of destination, Clare Menozzi, a population affairs officer at the department, told Africa Check. “The coverage of the empirical data on origin varies,” she said. “For some countries, it is extremely comprehensive, while for others less so. For many countries in Africa, the data tend to be less complete.” (Note: Nigeria’s last census was in 2006, when the population commission recorded 140.4 million people. In 2020, the commission estimated the country's population at 206.3 million.)      Countries in Desa’s sub-Saharan Africa region have a diaspora population of 28.29 million, the report says. South Sudan (2.58 million), Somalia (2.03 million), the Democratic Republic of Congo (1.83 million) and Burkina Faso (1.60 million) join Nigeria in the top five. Who counts in the diaspora?  Others have reported the size of Nigeria’s diaspora differently. Citing money transfer service Western Union, in December the Reuters news agency gave the number of Nigerians living abroad as 5 million. In 2017, Abike Dabiri-Erewa, head of the Nigerians in Diaspora Commission, gave the number of Nigerians living abroad as 15 million. Two years later she was reported saying it was 20 million.  But no source was given for either of these estimates. We have asked the commission for the evidence behind these figures. We asked Desa about possible reasons for the discrepancy in figures we were seeing. It could be due to differences in definition, Menozzi said. Desa’s diaspora estimates refer “to persons who are considered international migrants from a statistical perspective, namely persons who are foreign-born or foreign citizens”. Children of migrants born in countries or areas of destination are not included in this definition.   “I am wondering, given the size of the diaspora that you are citing, if it is based on a broader definition which often includes persons of a certain ancestry or descent, such as children and grandchildren,” she said. In a 2019 paper, the US census bureau also says different definitions have a significant implication on assessing the size of diasporas. As we do not have clarity on what Prompt counted, we rate its claim of 15 million Nigerians in the diaspora as unproven.",10/02/2021,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/how-many-nigerians-abroad-and-how-much-cash-do-they-send-home
igerians in the diaspora send back an estimated $25 billion in annual remittance,Unproven,"The World Bank estimates that Nigeria’s annual remittances in 2020 were  US$21 billion in 2020, down from $23.8 billion in 2019. To make its estimate, the bank used its own data and data from the International Monetary Fund’s Balance of Payments Statistics database, central banks and national statistical agencies. Nigeria’s central bank data, which is based on transfers to the public from the country’s formal banking system, put direct remittances in 2019 at $19.2 billion. The bank is yet to make 2020 remittance data available.     The problem of undeclared cash  But experts told Africa Check that official data on diaspora remittances was incomplete. “The data collected by the central bank are of funds sent through the banking system,” said Akinola Owosekun, a professor of economics at Bowen University in Iwo, southwest Nigeria.     “Nigerians abroad send money to their relatives and friends in Nigeria through some means without using the banks. There is no way to measure the number of dollars that come into this country in cash undeclared.” The country’s different exchange rate regimes also encourage informal channels. While remittances benefit the economy, “unaccounted remittances may have an extra impact”, said Philip Alege of the department of economics at Covenant University in Ota, southwest Nigeria.

Nigeria was seventh in 2020 with $21 billion, after Pakistan ($24 billion). In 2019 it was sixth, with an estimated $23.5 billion in annual remittances.  When remittances are considered as a share of a country’s gross domestic product, Nigeria is not in the top 10. Tonga tops the list, followed by Haiti, Lebanon and South Sudan.

"t independence, Nigeria had a population of 45 millio",Correct,"Nigeria’s population figures have historically been controversial, with resource allocation identified as a key reason for this. Gbolahan Oni is professor of demography and social statistics at Covenant University in southwestern Nigeria. He told Africa Check that only United Nations and World Bank population estimates should be relied on when looking at previous years. “These organisations have demographers who use scientific formulas to derive the population estimates, reducing the effect of overcounting and undercounting that occur in our census,” Oni said.   Data from the World Bank and the UN’s department of economic and social affairs shows Nigeria’s population was 45.1 million in 1960. That estimate was specifically for 1 July 1960, three months before independence day, the UN department told Africa Check.",15/10/2020,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/nigerias-population-economy-and-history-fact-checking-buharis-independence-day
igeria’s urban population at independence was approximately 7 millio,Correct,"For the share of Nigeria’s population classified as urban in 1960, Dr Thomas Spoorenberg directed us to the latest estimate from the World Urbanization Prospects: The 2018 Revision.  This was prepared by the UN’s department of economic and social affairs. Spoorenberg is the population affairs officer in the department’s population estimates and projection section.  The report estimates Nigeria’s 1960 urban population at 6.96 million.  Countries define urban in different ways, the UN’s population division says. Most – “nearly two thirds” – use an administrative definition “but almost all of them add an element such as population size, density, economic occupation or urban functions” to characterise urban areas. Denmark and Iceland, for example, define urban locals as only 200 inhabitants or more, while the Netherlands and Nigeria have a threshold of 20,000.",15/10/2020,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/nigerias-population-economy-and-history-fact-checking-buharis-independence-day
"Today, we grapple with multiple challenges with a population exceeding 200 million.",Correct,"Buhari said that while Nigeria’s landmass, which he gave as 910,768 square kilometres, remained the same,  the population had grown to more than 200 million people. Nigeria’s last population census was in 2006, when the National Population Commission recorded 140.4 million people. Even that count faced controversy.     Since then the population has been based on estimates, most recently 199 million in 2017, a figure from the National Bureau of Statistics. National media have reported that a new census is in the offing. The population commission currently estimates Nigeria’s population at 206.3 million, it was confirmed to Africa Check.  As of 1 July 2020, the UN estimated that Nigeria was home to more than 206 million people. Its population division shared a graph of how the population has changed with time. How does the UN make its estimate? Nigeria’s most recent official population estimate is from 2016, using 2006 census figures as a starting point. But while the UN has “used and considered” these official estimates up to 2016, Spoorenberg told us, details about the mortality, fertility and migration assumptions made were not available.  Nigeria’s official national population figure for 2016 is higher than the UN’s population estimate by about 7.7 million, Spoorenberg said.    The UN population unit said it had used several data sources, including the 2006 and previous population censuses, to inform its estimates about Nigeria. These go back to 1950.  The most recent information used is the 2016/17 Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey, Spoorenberg said. This survey was not part of official estimates because the latter are population projections based on the 2006 census.  The UN “reappraises every other year” the population estimates for all countries to take into account any new information. “A certain degree of uncertainty surrounds the size and structure of the population of Nigeria but given the demographic inertia a population cannot change overnight,” said Spoorenberg. “By mobilising fertility and mortality estimates from the most recent surveys, demographers can offer fairly accurate population estimates for Nigeria.”",15/10/2020,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/nigerias-population-economy-and-history-fact-checking-buharis-independence-day

"For a cumulative 29 of our 60 years of existence as a nation, we have been under military rule.",Correct,"Nigeria’s first experience of military rule started in 1966 with a coup, and lasted 13 years. In 1979, the country’s fourth military leader handed over power to an elected government. A second coup in 1983 brought on 16 more years of army rule, including Buhari’s regime from 1983 to 1985. Military rule ended in 1999. So the president is correct on this score.  But how do these two forms of rule broadly compare? There isn’t much to choose between them, Silvanus Ebohon, professor of political science at the University of Benin in southern Nigeria, told Africa Check. “One can argue that there has been better freedom of speech and association under civil rule, but in terms of development, there is no real difference,” he said. Corruption was a common theme across both civilian and military rule, Ebohon said, describing the country’s political system as “dysfunctional”. Professor Kamilu Fage teaches political science at Bayero University in the northern Nigerian city of Kano. He was also of the view that politicians have not done any better than the military. “Democracy is better than military rule for the elements of accountability and free speech,” he told Africa Check.  In his view, the Nigerian experience was that the military had done better than civilians in terms of governance, security and promoting national unity. Fage added that corruption had cut across both military and civilian rule.",15/10/2020,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/nigerias-population-economy-and-history-fact-checking-buharis-independence-day
"n northern Nigeria, the lack of secondary schools is significantly greater with up to 10 primary schools for every secondary school",Incorrect,"This claim should only have been in reference to public schools, Aby Toure, a communications officer at the World Bank, told Africa Check. She said the figure was sourced from a June 2020 project document. (The project document has a slight error. It says that “the lack of secondary schools is significantly greater in the north with more than 10 primary schools for every primary school”.) Mansir Nasir, a senior external affairs officer at the bank, gave more details and said the data was gleaned from the 2015/16 education management information system and the 2018 national personnel audit. The audit was compiled by Nigeria's universal basic education commission.   Audit retracted that World Bank based figures on By law, the first six years of primary education and the first three of junior secondary school are free and mandatory. In its formal document for the funding, the World Bank said the most recent data it had, from the education management information system, showed there were 21,688 senior secondary schools in 2015/16.  But in December 2018, the basic education commission retracted the bank’s second data source. Education groups and activists said the 2018 personnel audit was riddled with errors. For example, the audit captured figures from Enugu state as being from Ondo state, while it did not record data for private schools in most of the country’s southwestern states. Similar errors were also identified for Anambra and Imo states in the southeast. The audit also didn’t include full data on senior secondary schools, as they are not considered part of basic education. What does the most recent data show? The claim would be incorrect if any part of it was based on the recalled audit, Oriyomi Ogunwale, who is the project lead at Eduplana, an organisation that focuses on education in Nigeria, told Africa Check. “The 2018 national personnel audit report has been pulled down due to numerous errors. I advise that the claim be discarded and the report not used,” Ogunwale said. For accurate data, he directed Africa Check to statistics on public and private basic education compiled in 2018 by, among others, the basic education commission, the education ministry and the National Bureau of Statistics. Actual ratio about half that claimed by World Bank The statistics from the digest of basic education statistics on public and private schools show that as of 2018, there were 61,175 primary schools and 14,491 secondary schools in the north.  This works out to about four primary schools for every secondary school in Nigeria. When only public schools in the north are considered, the ratio rises to about five primary schools (43,480) for every secondary school (7,819).   This is about half the bank’s estimate. The northern state with the most primary schools for every secondary school is Kebbi, with a ratio of eight to one. If only public schools in Kebbi are counted, the ratio is five to one. The bank’s claim would have been accurate 10 years ago.  In 2010 there were an average of seven primary schools to every secondary school in the north. Kaduna state had 10 primary schools to every secondary school. Suleiman Bello, a professor of educational technology in the faculty of education at the University of Maiduguri in northeastern Nigeria, said for many years the priority in the north was teaching children to read and write, which had overshadowed the need to establish secondary schools.  But he told Africa Check this was starting to change, as more states were expanding current secondary schools or building  new ones.  The case for educating adolescent girlsWhile making a case for educating more adolescent girls, the World Bank notes that poor infrastructure and a lack of water and sanitation makes it difficult for girls to stay in school. Further, there is lower investment in girls education in the northern states.The development lender projects that if these conditions stay the same, “1.3 million girls out of the 1.85 million who began primary school in 2017/18 in the northern states will drop out before reaching the last year of junior secondary school”.The bank suggests that educating girls, especially at the secondary level, significantly improves their lives. This includes through “a reduction in child and maternal mortality rates, improvements in educational outcomes of offspring, and reducing poverty and promoting equitable growth”.Each additional year of secondary school is associated with, “on average a 10% increase in income”, it adds.",30/09/2020,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/world-bank-uses-outdated-stats-it-announces-500m-nigeria-education-plan
lose to 80% of poor households are in the north,Unproven,"The World Bank told Africa Check it had intended to say that 87%, and not 80%, of poor households are in the north.  The 87% estimate was based on “the 2015/16 general household survey by the National Bureau of Statistics”, senior external affairs officer Mansir Nasir said. (Note: We could not find this estimate in the survey.) While the household survey did capture household income and other socioeconomic indicators, there is more recent data. Leo Sanni, a statistician at the bureau, referred Africa Check to the 2019 report on poverty and inequality in Nigeria.  Released in May 2020, it measured poverty and living standards by surveying 22,110 households nationally from September 2018 to October 2019. It found that 40.1% of Nigerians qualified as poor, which meant that when inflation was accounted for, they had a per capita spending of less than N137,430 (US$356.31) per year. This meant that more than 82.9 million Nigerians “are considered poor by national standards”, the report said. (Note: Due to the Boko Haram insurgency, this number excludes Borno state, as only households in safe-to-visit areas were interviewed). High poverty numbers in the north The data shows northern states have the highest share of their populations living in poverty. The 10 states with the smallest proportions were all in the south. But it does not break down the information by households.  Dr Baba Madu is head of national accounts and macro-economic analysis at the statistics bureau. He said the latest data does not speak to the bank’s claim.  “No, there isn't any dataset in the poverty report that suggests that almost 80% of households considered poor, out of the 22,110 sampled, were found in the north,” he told Africa Check. As we could not trace the source of the bank’s statistic, we rate the claim as unproven.

"efore the novel coronavirus pandemic hit the globe, Nigeria spent 42% of its earnings on debt servicing",Mostly correct,"We asked the former vice president to provide evidence for his claims and for clarifications where necessary. We will update this report when he responds. The first cases of the novel coronavirus outside mainland China were reported in January 2020, according to the World Health Organization. Nigeria spent N2.1 trillion (about US$6.9 billion at the current official exchange rate) to service its debt in 2019, according to the country’s debt management office. Of this, N1.69 trillion ($5.5 billion) was for domestic debt, and N408 billion ($1.3 billion) for foreign debt.  Nigeria’s revenue in 2019 was N4.77 trillion, according to the country’s central bank. This came from sources such as oil and gas, value added tax, corporate tax and custom duty. Taken as a proportion of this revenue, about 44% was spent servicing debt. We therefore rate Abubakar’s figure of 42% as mostly correct. Economist warns debt servicing level ‘unsound’ Economics professor Philip Olomola told Africa Check that while there are “valid reasons” for the debt owed by the government, using nearly half of the country’s earnings to repay it was unsound in the long run. “In the face of dwindling revenue, governments take loans for projects and to keep the country running. However, debt servicing taking over 40% of the country’s earnings is not sustainable,” Olomola, who teaches at the Obafemi Awolowo University, Ife, said.",21/04/2020,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/covid-19-pandemic-fact-checking-former-nigeria-vp-abubakars-claims-about

Abubakar said it was inevitable that Africa would take an economic hit from the pandemic, and said the agency had already revised growth projections for the region. A spokesperson for the commission, Privat Akochaye, directed Africa Check to a French-language report published in April 2020. This showed that the agency had pared back its growth forecast for the region for 2020, from 3.2% to between 1.8% and 2% in a best-case scenario. But this could shrink to 0.1% or, in a worst-case scenario, to as low as -2.6%.

he price of oil was lower when president Obasanjo and Abubakar assumed office on 29 May 1999 than it is today ..,Mostly correct,"The former VP’s point was that a crash in the price of oil should not automatically “trigger a crisis”. Abubakar took office as president Olusegun Obasanjo’s deputy on 29 May 1999, serving two terms until 2007. In May 1999, the price of Nigeria’s main crude oil export, Bonny Light, was US$16.94 per barrel, according to historical data from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. On 8 April 2020, the day Abubakar’s article was published, Bonny Light crude sold at $25.89 per barrel. Strictly interpreted, Abubaka was accurate that the price of oil was lower in 1999. Be cautious when comparing oil prices, says economist But comparing the prices of oil in 1999 and in 2020 should be done with caution, economics professor Philip Olomola told Africa Check. “There is a need to consider economic fundamentals such as the changes in the demand for the commodity,” he said.  “The US for instance was buying more crude oil from Nigeria in 1999 than it is buying today. It’s not just about the price. Even if it rises to $100 per barrel, if there are no buyers, it would make no difference,” he said.",21/04/2020,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/covid-19-pandemic-fact-checking-former-nigeria-vp-abubakars-claims-about
 yet they paid off Nigeria’s entire foreign debt,Incorrect,"Returning to a familiar 2019 presidential campaign talking point, Abubakar compared debt levels during his time as VP with those of the current administration of president Muhammadu Buhari. When he exited office in 2007, Nigeria’s foreign debt had been “paid off”, Abubakar said. Is this accurate? A highlight of the Obasanjo administration was a debt cancellation deal it negotiated with the “Paris Club”, an informal group of 22 creditor countries. In 2005 the creditors wrote off $18 billion of the roughly $30 billion Nigeria had owed them at the end of 2004. This was 84% of the country’s foreign debt as at December 2004. Nigeria still had to pay $12.4 billion, according to the public announcement by the group, which was made in April 2006. Nigeria also paid its debt to private banks known as the “London Club” in a similar deal. The country’s debt office showed this was done in 2007. But this statement of accounts showed Nigeria’s foreign debt was $3.54 billion at the end of 2006 and $3.65 billion at the end of 2007.  The data shows the Obasanjo government did not settle Nigeria’s foreign debt as the VP claimed. They handed over to a new government in May 2007. That year, Nigeria still spent more than $1 billion to service foreign debts.",21/04/2020,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/covid-19-pandemic-fact-checking-former-nigeria-vp-abubakars-claims-about
"igeria has devoted N37 billion to renovating the national assembly complex, which was built from the scratch for less than 20% of that amount",Unproven,"Abubakar also faulted the recent approval of a reported N37 billion to renovate the national assembly, which he said was “built from scratch” for less than a fifth of this. Nigeria’s plan to spend this amount, approved in December 2019, is the subject of public debate.  The contract to initially build the national assembly was awarded in February 1996, with construction lasting two and a half years. The company that built it has given the value of the contract as N7 billion. But the value of Nigeria’s currency has depreciated significantly over the years, economics professor Philip Olomola told Africa Check. When comparing the two figures, one “should consider factors such as changes in exchange rate and in the cost of construction equipment and material”, the economist said.  Difficult to do a direct comparison In 1996 the exchange rate was N21.9 to the US dollar. This means about $320 million was devoted to the construction of the complex. In December 2019, when the renovation budget was approved, the official exchange rate was N306 to the dollar, or $121 million.  Olomola said the purchasing power of N7 billion in 1996 is likely to be more valuable than that of N37 billion today.  Building costs higher in 2020 than 1996, says quantity surveying expert The cost of building equipment and material has also generally increased over the years, King Nyenke, a professor of quantity surveying at the Rivers State University, told Africa Check. Nyenke said that if he were provided with the same bill of quantity as in 1996, the cost of building it now “would be higher” than N7 billion. Because of the changes in these fundamentals, it is difficult to know for certain if the repair bill for the national assembly would be less than 20% what it cost to construct it.  So we rate this claim as unproven.",21/04/2020,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/covid-19-pandemic-fact-checking-former-nigeria-vp-abubakars-claims-about
13 billion was devoted to the State House clinic in the last five years,Incorrect,"The hospital at the president’s official residence is often reported as being ill-equipped and barely functional despite being allocated a large budget every year.  “It is virtually useless as we face the most significant public health challenge of our national life,” Abubakar wrote, claiming that N13 billion was allocated to the hospital in the five years to 2020. A similar claim was published by the Daily Trust newspaper on 6 April. Budget documents of 2016 to 2020 differ The budget allocation to the facility in the 2016 budget – the first of Buhari’s administration – was N2.83 billion. It dropped to N331.7 million in the 2017 budget before rising to N1.03 billion in the 2018 budget.  In 2019 N799 million was budgeted for the hospital, and N723 million for 2020. The total is about N5.7 billion – less than half Abubakar’s claim. (Note: The amounts released are sometimes less than what's budgeted, but a lack of historical data on budget implementation makes it difficult to know the exact amount that reached the hospital over the period.)",21/04/2020,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/covid-19-pandemic-fact-checking-former-nigeria-vp-abubakars-claims-about
he N-Power programme has yielded over 2 million direct and indirect employment opportunitie,Unproven,"According to its website, N-Power seeks to give young Nigerians aged between 18 and 35 “requisite skills” and “work experience opportunities”. It was launched in 2016. Both the presidency and the agency that oversees N-Power, the National Social Investment Office, are yet to respond to our requests for the source of these figures.  (Note: Africa Check has for weeks sought this data, but was only directed to a top official who headed the project in Buhari’s first term. He did not work on Mustapha’s speech, he said.)  The most recent numbers on the social office’s website are from a June 2019 update, and are much lower than Mustapha’s. The update said that as of August 2018, some 500,000 graduates were working in sectors like teaching, health, agriculture and tax. The graduates are volunteers but are paid a monthly stipend of N30,000 (about US$98) by the government.  Some 26,000 non-graduates are in training or are interns, the update said. A year later in an August 2019 interview with a national newspaper, Mary Uwais, a top official with the N-Power programme, cited the same numbers.  N-Power beneficiaries ‘unlikely to create multiple jobs’ It is unlikely that N-Power could have created multiple employment opportunities, Dr Anthony Orji, a development economist who teaches at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, said. This is because it is not really an entrepreneurship programme, he told Africa Check. “I don’t think it can really generate many indirect jobs, because many of the beneficiaries are engaged in teaching in schools and as health workers. “And they are paid N30,000 a month. They can’t build businesses that employ many people.” The programme says it provides training and information on entrepreneurship, but does not break down how many of its beneficiaries have started their own businesses. More details needed about where the jobs are To support its jobs claim, the government should have given details, including where the jobs are located, Orji said. “Ideally, it is the National Bureau of Statistics that should verify and present the numbers from the programme,” he said. But the national data agency does not have any role in the programme including verifying jobs, Dr Isiaka Olanrewaju, the agency’s director of household statistics, told Africa Check.  According to the most recent data, some 55.4% of Nigerian youths between ages 15 to 35 are underemployed or unemployed. This translates to 24.5 million youth who are doing in-between jobs, or have nothing to do.According to the most recent official data, some 43.1% of all Nigerians, or 39.14 million, are either unemployed or underemployed. These numbers, from the third quarter of 2018, are the most recent yet.In the absence of publicly available data showing how the 2 million jobs supposedly created by N-Power are distributed, we rate this claim as unproven.",27/08/2019,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/no-evidence-big-millions-jobs-claim-nigerian-senior-official
he N-Power programme has lifted over 5 million Nigerians out of extreme povert,Unproven,"Nigeria’s statistics bureau counts anyone living on less than US$2 a day as poor, and as extremely poor if they live on less than $1.25 a day. The most recent nationally representative survey of poverty was in 2009/10. For this, the National Bureau of Statistics drew the absolute poverty line at N55,235 per person per year, with 62.6% of Nigerians (102.2 million) falling into this category. In a preceding survey in 2003/04, some 64.2% of Nigerians were classified as absolutely poor, with the poverty line drawn at N28,837.    There have been more recent attempts at estimating absolute poverty in Nigeria. In June 2018, US-based Brookings Institute caused a stir in Nigeria after it said that the country had overtaken India as having the largest number of people living in extreme poverty. Brookings Institute said there were 87 million such Nigerians in May 2018. In August 2019, this had risen to 94.1 million. The researchers used the UN’s definition of extreme poverty. This is anyone earning less than $1.90 at 2011 internationally adjusted prices, Kristopher Hamel, the CEO of World Data Lab, which calculates the data, told Africa Check in 2018.  (Note: You can read more about its approach here. ‘Officials should produce evidence’ An expert told Africa Check that without open numbers the claim that N-Power has lifted 5 million Nigerians out of extreme poverty is difficult to verify. Dr Olukemi Lawanson, an associate professor of labour and development economics at the University of Lagos said that the government should produce the evidence to support its position. “If the N-Power programme has yielded about 500,000 jobs for graduates, it does not seem likely to me that those jobs could have resulted in lifting up to 5 million Nigerians out of extreme poverty,” Lawanson told Africa Check.  “But then it is possible depending on the kind of jobs and how much they pay. The government should present the facts to prove it.” Lawanson said that if, for instance, a graduate gets a job paying the recently approved minimum wage of N30,000 monthly, they are not likely to be above extreme poverty if they support at least one person, which is usually the case.  “Earning N30,000 in a month comes down to living on about $3 in a day for one person. When you add dependants to it, they all remain in extreme poverty.”",27/08/2019,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/no-evidence-big-millions-jobs-claim-nigerian-senior-official
Crimes in Cross River state represent 1.1% of the total crime in Nigeria,Incorrect,"Nakanya Iyadim, information officer in the state’s communication’s ministry, confirmed to Africa Check that the governor did make the claims. However the governor’s office did not respond to our queries about the source of the statistics.  The best source to check this claim is the public order, safety and crime statistics compiled by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), Dr Isiaka Olarewaju, director of household statistics at the bureau, told Africa Check.  But he said the NBS data “is as reported”. There could be unreported crimes, Olarewaju added. Under-reporting is often an issue.  Dr Ona Ekhomu is president of the Association of Industrial Security and Safety Operators of Nigeria. He told Africa Check that one reason for this is the fear of victimisation by the police.  “The way Nigeria police operates, most times there is little or no care for the victim of crime. It's not very easy to report crime in Nigeria and many incidents go unreported,” Ekhomu said. Other reasons include the perception that the authorities will not help, or because of the nature of the crime, such as sexual assault. The statistics office aggregates data on incidences of crime reported to the police in each of Nigeria’s 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory, the area around the capital Abuja. It has three categories for this:  Offences against people, such as murder, manslaughter, infanticide and rape.   Offences against properties, such as stealing, receiving stolen goods, obtaining property by false pretence, robbery and burglary.   Offences against lawful authority, such as the failure to pay your taxes.   The numbers tell a different story The most recent report on crime statistics was released in June 2018 and covers 2017.  It shows that 134,663 cases were reported to the police in Nigeria in 2017. Of these, 2,163 were reported in Cross River state working out to 1.61% of all reported cases, not 1.1% as the governor claimed.  Were Ayade’s claim correct, then 1,481 cases of crime would have been reported in Cross River.",18/07/2019,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/nigerias-cross-river-state-among-safest-governor-claimed
Cross River has the least total crime in the country,Incorrect,"The data from the National Bureau of Statistics show Lagos state had the highest number of reported cases of crime, at 50,975 or 37.9% of the total. Kebbi state, in the north west, had the lowest share of total cases reported, with 0.15% of the total. Cross River state had 2,163 reported cases, at least 20 other states had fewer reported cases.   The governor was thus also incorrect with this claim.  The location of the state in the Niger Delta is a red flag, Wale Obydeen, the editor-in-chief of Security Monitor Nigeria, told Africa Check. “Cross River cannot be the most peaceful state. Niger Delta we know is a volatile region and of course we should expect violence,” he said. This is due to oil exploration in the region, and crimes particular to this such as the kidnapping of expatriates. Put crime numbers in context But context is important when comparing crime in different areas. As explained in our guide to understanding crime statistics, comparing absolute crime numbers across regions without factoring in their populations skews comparisons.  Instead, one could work out the reported cases per 100,000 people. When the category of crimes against persons is considered, Cross River’s ratio is 25 reported cases per 100,000 people, placing it eighth out of the country’s states. The state had a population of 3.9 million people in 2016. But working this out for all categories is more difficult, Dr Ona Ekhomu, the president of the Association of Industrial Security and Safety Operators of Nigeria, said. As such crime should be considered “in their silos”, he said.  “It is not good to lump them together. For instance a community that has a lot of crime against property but little crime against person will be considered safer than another that has more of crime against persons,” said Ekhomu. To make it more complicated, Nigeria's population figures are strongly disputed, with a national census last held in 2006. The latest population estimates by states are from 2016 and should be used with caution. Population characteristics should also be considered, Ekhomu said. For example some Nigerian states are more populated but have less crime than neighbouring ones with fewer people.

Nigeria ranks 15th in the world for its suicide rate,Correct,"We contacted Kalayjian to check if the statistics were correctly attributed to her. “Yes [for the] suicide rate as per World Health Organization (2016) Nigeria is at 15th in the world,” she said.  In 2018, Africa Check investigated a similar claim that Nigeria had 15 suicides per 100,000 people every year. We found that the accurate crude suicide death rate was lower, at 9.5 suicides per 100,000 people in 2016.  This was according to global mortality statistics from the WHO’s 2016 Global Health Observatory data repository.  The crude suicide rate is the number of suicide deaths in a year, divided by the population and multiplied by 100,000. As Nigeria is one of a number of countries that do not yet have high quality data, the WHO used mortality rate models to determine this rate. 2016 WHO data still the most recent The 2016 global health estimates were still the most recent global data on suicide rates, Oye Gureje, a professor of psychiatry, told Africa Check. He is also director of the WHO mental health research and training centre at the University of Ibadan. The estimates were last updated in 2018. Two estimated mortality rates from suicide are given, namely age-standardised and crude. This is according to Dr Alexandra Fleischmann, a scientist at the department of mental health and substance abuse at the WHO. “For comparisons between countries, age-standardised rates are the most appropriate to look at,” Fleischmann told Africa Check. The age-standardised rate adjusts for differences in the age distribution of the population, assuming a standard population for all countries, she said. “Indeed, according to the GHE for 2016, Nigeria ranked 15th in the age-standardised suicide rate in the world,” Fleischmann said. On this, Kalayjian was correct, even if she had a higher crude suicide rate.",10/07/2019,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/nigeria-ranked-15th-world-suicide-lesotho-tops-african-list

Over 40% of primary school teachers are unqualified,Incorrect,"A brochure on the Oando Foundation’s website states that 44% of primary school teachers are unqualified. Africa Check has asked if the figure includes both public and private primary school teachers but the foundation has not responded.   The National Teachers Institute requires that a teacher has at least a national certificate in education, or NCE, to be qualified to teach in primary school. In 2016, according to federal ministry of education data, 550,262 teachers, or 72% of the 764,596 teachers in both public and private primary schools, had an NCE. This ratio rises to 86% when only public primary school teachers are considered. This means 28% of all primary school teachers, and 14% of teachers in public primary schools, do not have an NCE. We therefore rate the claim as incorrect. ‘Unqualified teachers have nothing to offer pupils’ Julie Ibiam, a professor of childhood education at the University of Nigeria in Nsukka, pointed out that the percentage of unqualified primary school teachers varies across Nigeria’s states, with the northern regions worst affected. “If teachers are unqualified, then what do they have to offer children?” she asked. “These days, there are so many NCE colleges that claim to be approved, but they aren’t. In the university I lecture, there are teachers on sandwich programmes who can’t write proper English.” (Note: In Nigeria, a sandwich programme is study towards a qualification between periods of being at work.) Is the ministry’s education data reliable? Africa Check noted inconsistencies in the education ministry’s data. For example, Abia state has more qualified primary school teachers (118,688) listed than the total number of teachers in the state (96,424). The ministry is yet to respond to our query about this. But Christopher Obiofuma, an education data officer at the National Bureau of Statistics, said the ministry’s data is largely reliable and the agency uses it in its calculations.Oriyomi Ogunwale from Eduplana, an education advocacy group, says he sometimes points out to the ministry inconsistencies in their data, asking them to improve how they gather data.",17/09/2018,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/number-qualified-primary-school-teachers-and-grade-6-literacy-nigeria-higher
50% of grade six pupils cannot read at all,Incorrect,"This claim also appears in the brochure on the foundation’s site with the United Nations Children's Fund (Unicef) cited as its source. Geoffrey Njoku, a communication specialist at Unicef, directed us to the 2015 Nigeria education data survey for the most recent statistics on literacy in Nigeria. The survey was carried out by the National Population Commission, the education ministry and the National Bureau of Statistics, with funding from the United States Agency for International Development (USAid). Out of 84,832 eligible children interviewed across Nigeria, literacy assessments were done for 79,374 children in both public and private schools. Children were considered literate if they could read at least one of three words in English or in one of three national languages presented on a flashcard. The survey found that for those in grade 6 (also known as primary 6), the literacy rate was 80%. This meant 20% of children in this grade couldn’t read at all.

30% of pupils drop out of primary school.,Downplayed,"Duke has not responded to Africa Check’s request for the Unicef stats he quoted. We found them on an undated Unicef Nigeria web page. It reads: “According to current data, 30% of pupils drop out of primary school and only 54% transit to Junior Secondary Schools.” We asked Unicef communication specialist Eva Hinds to clarify. She said the numbers were old. ""The outdated webpage you are referring to has been disconnected from our site some time ago but it has not been permanently deleted,” she said. “I have asked this action to be taken now."" A few days later, Unicef deleted the page. The original page is archived here. So what is the dropout rate?  Dr Ricardo Sabates, an academic at the University of Cambridge’s Research for Equitable Access and Learning Centre, directed Africa Check to reliable databases such as that by the Institute for Statistics, the official data agency of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation. One way to measure the school dropout rate is to look at how many kids in a group who enter the first grade make it all the way to the final grade. This “cohort survival rate” was 64.38% in 2009, the year the institute last has data on, meaning about 35% - more than Duke’s figure - had dropped out.",31/07/2018,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/crisis-nigerian-schooling-grading-three-claims-presidential-hopeful
Only 54% transit to junior secondary schools.,Exaggerated,"In 1999, the government introduced a plan to ensure all Nigerian children of primary and secondary age get free and compulsory basic education. Parents or officials who prevent this education may be punished under the Universal Basic Education Act of 2004. The 2016/17 Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey found the transition rate of pupils from primary to junior secondary school to be 49%. This is the number of children in the first grade of secondary school compared with the number in the last grade of primary school the previous year. To arrive at this estimate, more than 37,000 household members aged 25 to 49 were interviewed across Nigeria. We thus rate Duke’s claim as exaggerated as he suggested more children make it to secondary school than actually do. The current government has pledged to raise the rate to 75% by 2019. The transition rate has however dropped from 74% in 2011 to 49% in 2017. Reasons for this include teachers' welfare, poor implementation of the basic education plan and school charges such as for exams. This is according to Dr Abdulrahman Maigida, a lecturer at the University of Port Harcourt and a specialist in educational history and policy. “This situation also leaves the country with the burden of an unproductive or unskilled populace,” Maigida told Africa Check.",31/07/2018,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/crisis-nigerian-schooling-grading-three-claims-presidential-hopeful
"Nigeria has over 10 million out-of-school children, the highest number in the world.",Incorrect,"On another page of its website, Unicef notes that “Nigeria still has 10.5 million out-of-school children - the world’s highest number”. In an August 2017 fact-check, Africa Check found that Unesco’s Institute for Statistics had revised this figure, which was based on 2010 enrolment data from Nigeria. It was an estimate based on the 2011 Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey by the National Bureau of Statistics. But with new population estimates the number was revised to 8.7 million in 2014.   The 10.5 million figure is dated and new interventions may have changed the existing data, Azuka Menkiti, an education specialist with Unicef in Nigeria reportedly said in May 2018. Alexander Onukwue, the education policy lead of Eduplana Nigeria, said politicians should use accurate data in public. The organisation campaigns for education funding and teachers’ development.  “It is based on this data they’ll make promises and if such are faulty or incorrect, then they'll give us questionable education policies,” Onukwue said.

In at least three years since 2008, the allocation to public projects on roads, power, railways and so forth exceeded 30%. This was in 2008, 2010 and 2013, according to budgetary data. The infrastructure share during this time was the highest in 2008, at 37% of the total budget. The lowest allocation in that period was 11% of the budget in 2015, which was approved by Buhari’s predecessor, Goodluck Jonathan.

"The country achieved 5,222.3 MW representing the highest peak of power generated onto the national grid and delivered to customers in December 2017.",Misleading,"Buhari said the peak showed government’s progress in increasing the quantity and quality of power available to Nigerians. The country’s long-standing electricity deficit is persistently blamed for hurting economic growth. According to a daily power brief run from the vice president’s office, the peak of 5,222.3 MW generated was reached on 18 December 2017. However, the average amount of power sent out on the day to customers was 4,266 MW. Kingsley Osuoha is general manager of the control centre at the national transmission company. He told Africa Check that the president’s figure represented the peak of power generation that occurred that day, but this is not what would have reached consumers due to transmission losses.(Note: For more information on Nigeria’s power, read our detailed factsheet.)",29/05/2018,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/buharis-2018-democracy-day-speech-7-main-claims-under-scrutiny
"Recently, a new Maintenance Repair and Overhaul facility with capacity for aircraft C-checks and other comprehensive levels of maintenance was established in Lagos",Correct,"The Lagos centre is one of his government's strides in aviation and would save the country an estimated US$90 million yearly, Buhari added. A centre to service aircraft – known in the industry as a “maintenance, repair and overhaul” facility - can help attract passengers and cargo, Africa Check found in a September 2017 report. Other gains include the creation of jobs and saving on money that would otherwise be spent in another country to service aircraft. Aviation experts said that maintenance, repair and overhauls “can be very limited, basic tasks performed at an airport (line maintenance) or complex maintenance checks including structural work (base or heavy maintenance)”. A C-check falls under heavy maintenance. The Lagos centre is owned by indigenous airline Aero Contractors which was taken over by the Asset Management Company of Nigeria in 2016. It was launched in Lagos in February 2018 after C-checks were successfully done on a Boeing 737 aircraft owned by Aero. Captain Ado Bayero, who now heads Aero Contractor, confirmed to Africa Check that the facility is fully operational and as at 30 May 2018 had three aircraft in its hangar undergoing different checks. He said the facility has certification up to C-checks and will help other airlines save money and time.",29/05/2018,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/buharis-2018-democracy-day-speech-7-main-claims-under-scrutiny
[Government] has ensured proper funding at the Basic Education level with the disbursement of N42.2 billion UBE Matching Grant to 26 States and the FCT,Unproven,"Under its Universal Basic Education programme, Nigeria seeks to provide nine years of free and compulsory formal education. To support this, the government gives states a grant to fund classrooms, laboratories, libraries, and buy other learning aids such as books. The most recent publicly available data from the Universal Basic Education Commission shows that N33.9 billion was disbursed to states in 2015/2016. Commission data shows that as at August 2017 none of the country’s states had accessed N732 million allocated to each. In total, N71 billion was unused by states. (Note: Africa Check has contacted the basic education commission for the president’s data and will update this report with their response.) Further, to access this grant, the law requires states to put up a similar amount in addition to showing how they spend the money. Many do not meet this requirement, leading to the head of the commission, Hamid Bobboyi, to reportedly highlight his concerns about the low uptake. An education lobby told Africa Check that they could not find data to support Buhari’s claim. “Unfortunately, there is no recent verifiable evidence that this amount has been paid out to that number of states,” Oriyomi Ogunwale, the project lead of Eduplana Nigeria, said. Ogunwale added that disbursements in 2015 and 2016 had been a concern.

Rice importation from other countries has been cut down by 90%,Correct,"The presidency also made this claim in its 2017 Democracy Day speech. Data shared with Africa Check by the national statistics office shows that the official value of rice imports fell 99% between 2015, when Buhari took office, and 2017. TABLE: Value of Nigeria rice imports (2014-2017) YEAR Value ( Naira) Per year % reduction 2014 107.65 bn * 2015 95.88 bn 10.9 2016 17.91 bn 81.3 2017 0.95 bn 94.5 *2013 data not available. SOURCE: NATIONAL BUREAU OF STATISTICS In this period the government introduced policies to cut imports such as tariff increases and foreign currency restrictions. It also started a plan to lend to local farmer at lower interest rates. As a result, while local production is increasing, it is still not enough to meet demand in Africa’s largest consumer of rice. Nigeria grew 3.7 million metric tonnes of rice in 2017, a 4% increase over 2016, according to the US department of agriculture.

About 8.2 million pupils are currently being fed from 24 States of the Federation,Unproven,"Nigeria’s school feeding programme aims to improve attendance and improve child nutrition and cognition, among other goals. Some 18 states were to be piloted in 2016, according to the programme’s 2016-2020 strategic plan, with all 36 states to be covered by 2018. Official statements of how many children are benefiting have grown from a million pupils in seven states in February 2017 to 7 million in 22 states in February 2018. In May 2018 the vice president put the figure at 7.6 million in 22 states, before President Buhari’s latest figure of 8.2 million children in 24 states. The national statistics office did not have data on the programme as it was not mandated to survey it, Dr Isiaka Olarewaju, a director at the National Bureau of Statistics, told Africa Check.  There is no way to independently verify the government’s figures, Dr Moses Amosun, who teaches at the department of early childhood and educational foundations at the University of Ibadan told Africa Check. Amosun said that “what should matter is how the programme has affected basic education outcomes across the country.”",29/05/2018,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/buharis-2018-democracy-day-speech-7-main-claims-under-scrutiny
"Despite record low oil prices, this administration was able to invest an additional US$500 million into the [Sovereign Wealth] Fund.",Correct,"To preface this claim, Buhari said that the country’s Sovereign Wealth Fund had not received any investment for four years under the previous government, even when oil prices were as high as US$120 a barrel. The sovereign fund was set up in October 2012 to help Nigeria invest extra money made from selling crude oil, its major export. It is managed by the Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority. The fund allocates 40% of its resources to the Nigeria Infrastructure Fund while another 40% goes to the Future Generations Fund. The remainder is allocated to the Stabilisation Fund, a buffer against economic shocks. In its 2016 financial statement, the investment agency reported it had received a capital contribution of US$250 million (N49 billion), which was approved by the National Economic Council in November 2015. The council also approved another US$250 million in February 2017. Titilope Olubiyi, a spokesman for the investment authority, confirmed to Africa Check that they have received a total of US$500 million from the current administration and that this money had been paid in. No additional contribution came from the previous administration after its initial seed fund of US$1 billion, she said.",29/11/2017,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/hit-or-miss-taking-stock-5-claims-buharis-2018-budget-speech
This administration was able to invest an unprecedented sum of over N1.2 trillion in capital projects through the 2016 budget… the highest ever in the history of this country.,Incorrect,"Vice president Yemi Osinbajo also made this claim in  August 2017.

People are at work on a building site of the Abuja light rail project in September 2012. Nigeria is looking to strengthen its infrastructure. Photo: AFP/STRINGERAs at May 2017, when the previous year's budget was still active, N1.219 trillion was due to have been released as capital spend (on infrastructure) to ministries, departments and agencies, according to the 4th quarter report of 2016. (Note: In total N1.59 trillion was set aside for roads, hospitals and other capital works for the year.) We pored through historical data on the country’s budget performance from 2007 to 2016. Data from the Central Bank of Nigeria shows that in the 2009 budget, along with two other supplementary budgets approved for that year, a total of N1.28 trillion was spent on different capital projects. The claim that N1.2 trillion spent on capital projects in 2016 is the highest in the country’s history is inaccurate. The available evidence suggests a slightly higher amount of N1.28 trillion was spent in 2009.

"As at 30 October 2017, our external reserves had increased to US$34 billion.",Mostly correct,"A country has many uses for its external (or foreign) reserves, from paying for imports and stabilising markets to meeting its international financial obligations. Nigeria’s reserves - mainly savings from crude oil sales, royalties, and taxes - provide a buffer against external economic shocks such as a sharp drop in oil prices. Buhari said his government had helped stabilise the foreign exchange market, thus increasing the country’s savings. In June 2015, shortly after Buhari was sworn in, Nigeria's gross foreign reserves were at US$28.34 billion. By the end of October 2017, it had grown to US$33.79 billion, data from the Central Bank of Nigeria showed.",29/11/2017,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/hit-or-miss-taking-stock-5-claims-buharis-2018-budget-speech
Our tax-to-GDP ratio of about 6% is one of the lowest in the world.,Correct,"The tax-to-gross domestic product ratio is a country’s total tax revenue expressed as a percentage of its GDP. It shows the share of a country's output that is collected by the government through taxes. In 2016, Nigeria collected roughly N6 trillion in tax, Taiwo Oyedele, the head of tax and corporate advisory services at auditing firm PricewaterhouseCoopers told Africa Check. This was made up of around N4 trillion collected by the Federal Inland Revenue Service, a little over N1 trillion from the Nigeria Customs Service and N801 billion by the 36 states. With the country’s GDP for 2016 at about N101 trillion, the tax-to-GDP ratio works out to about 6%.  ‘Due to public mistrust of government spending’ Is it one of the lowest tax-to-GDP rates in the world? The World Bank’s most recent data shows that Nigeria’s rate was 1.5% in 2013. This was the third lowest worldwide, only exceeding that of Kuwait (0.77%) and the United Arab Emirates’s 0.37%. (Note: Nigeria rebased its GDP in 2013 to capture some previously undercounted areas of the economy.) Between 2003 and 2013, Nigeria’s tax revenue as a share of its GDP was highest in 2008 at 5.5%. This placed the country ahead of only 5 other nations: Estonia, Oman, Federated States of Micronesia, Kuwait and Bahrain. Oyedele said the low tax compliance was partly due to the public’s mistrust of how authorities spend their taxes. ""This could be explained by the fact that people have to spend their money to take care of what government should ordinarily provide - whether it's security, roads, water, electricity and so many other things.""",29/11/2017,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/hit-or-miss-taking-stock-5-claims-buharis-2018-budget-speech

(Note: However, a few pages on, the report notes that “so far, 2,000 youth have been empowered through the N-Power programme”.)

He highlighted the YouWin programme under the previous administration of Goodluck Jonathan. Nweze said that due to a lack of details about how the N-Power scheme was working out, it would be difficult to gauge its impact.

Nigeria has the highest incidence of diabetes in sub-Saharan Africa.,Unproven,"In support of his claims, Ikeme directed Africa Check to two studies on diabetes in Nigeria. One, a 2008 study, cited WHO estimates that 1.7 million Nigerians were living with diabetes while the other put the number at 4 million in 2014. “I fear the [media] reports may be slightly overrepresented as the publications indicate that about 4 million are suggested to have diabetes and 70%-80% of these remain undiagnosed.

Over 50% of girls [in] the age bracket of 18 and 20 were given out in marriage in this part of the country.,Mostly correct,"The emir of Kano, Muhammadu Sanusi II, speaks at his coronation as the 57th emir of the ancient Kano emirate in February 2015. Photo: AFP/AMINU ABUBAKAR"" /> Sanusi told Africa Check by email that he meant the girls in this age group “were married off when they were adolescents below 18”. He added that he was specifically referring to the northeastern and northwestern part of northern Nigerian. The northeastern geopolitical zone includes the states of Borno, Yobe, Taraba, Adamawa, Bauchi and Gombe. The northwest consists of Kano, Kaduna, Sokoto, Zamfara, Kebbi, Katsina, and Jigawa states. The emir forwarded Africa Check the document on which he said he had based this claim, called “Education for the girl child in Northern Nigeria”. It’s not clear who compiled it. The document stated that more than half of the women in the northeast and northwest were married off before the age of 16, referencing the country’s 2008 Demographic and Health Survey. However, this figure refers to women between 20 and 49. In surveys such as these, respondents are divided into five year age brackets. Girls in the age group 15 to 19 can’t yet answer whether they were first married by age 18, as many of them are still to turn 18. (Note: For this reason, the UN resorts to the 20-24 age group when reporting on child marriage.)      At the time of Nigeria’s 2013 Demographic and Health Survey, the median age of first marriage for women between 20 and 49 in the northeast had gone up from 15.6 years to 16.4 years. But there was barely any change in the northwest’s median age: from 15.3 years in 2008 to 15.4 years in 2013. Though there isn’t data available for the group the emir was talking about – girls aged 18 and 19 in Nigeria’s northeast and northwest – the available data point to the claim being correct.",29/03/2017,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/nigerian-girls-plight-claims-about-teen-marriage-pregnancy-fact-checked
Girls who get pregnant below the age of 15 are 5 times as likely to die as girls who get pregnant at the age of 20.,Unproven,"The emir provided Africa Check with a briefing note on the health risks associated with teenage pregnancies. It cited a 2012 United Nations Population Fund factsheet, which in turn referenced a trends in maternal mortality report compiled by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and other international bodies. However, the WHO report does not mention a five-fold increase in risk. Africa Check asked the UN Population Fund for proof of the statistic. The organisation’s communication specialist for youth and population, Eddie Wright, relayed comment from members of their technical division. “Our technical experts wish to stress that most sources of maternal mortality rates have substantial biases or uncertainties, as in general, it is hard to measure,” Wright wrote. “But [the rate for women] under age 15 is particularly difficult - first because births below 15 are less common and the locations where pregnancies at this age are more likely to occur are also locations where all records of such events are less reliable.” Given that “sound data are hard to secure” the organisation relies on two studies, in particular, Wright added. The first is a study based on data collected in the late 1960s in a rural Bangladesh county, which showed a death rate for mothers aged 10 to 14 that was 4.7 higher than for those aged 20 to 24. The second was a hospital-based study carried out in several Latin American countries between 1985 and 2003. The results indicated a 4 time higher risk for teen mothers younger than 15 compared to those in the 20-24 age group. A University of Southampton lecturer with interests in maternal health in low and middle-income countries, Dr Sarah Neal, co-authored a study in The Lancet reviewing maternal mortality rates in 144 countries. “It used to be believed that all adolescents were at very increased risk of maternal mortality,” she told Africa Check. However, this study and another she co-authored suggested “the risks are not as great or universal as previously believed”. Neal is currently systematically reviewing the studies to estimate how the risk differs for younger teenagers. (Note: We will update the report once her findings are released.) “Data from large-scale studies in Africa are limited, but I think research certainly consistently suggests the risk for young adolescents are marked higher than for older adolescents or women in their 20s,” she said. “I would be reluctant to put a figure on how much more of a risk it is though based on the data available and the fact it may well vary regionally. We therefore rate this claim unproven until better data are available.",29/03/2017,https://africacheck.org//fact-checks/reports/nigerian-girls-plight-claims-about-teen-marriage-pregnancy-fact-checked
