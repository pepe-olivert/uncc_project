The captions of the post claimed that angry youths at Birnin Gwari Local Government Area of Kaduna State are protesting against the candidacy of Tinubu, saying they won’t vote for him in the 2023 general elections.', 'FALSE', 'To verify the authenticity of the claim, a frame-by-frame analysis of the video was carried out and it revealed that the video first surfaced online on December 12, 2022, at the Emir’s palace in Birnin Gwari LGA of Kaduna State. However, some comments under some of the posts indicate that the event was not connected to Tinubu even though he was present at the palace when the event happened. An indigene of Birnin Gwari, Ibrahim Jigo, who attended the event, told our correspondent that the people in the video were protesting against the state Commissioner for Internal Security Samuel Aruwan over a controversial statement he made on insecurity issues in the state. He said, “The people have grudges with the commissioner for two or three reasons but the biggest grudge is the people feeling his reports on insecurity is always not in the favour of the locals. He always downplays the intensity of the situation. “Some of the protesters were businessmen whose motorcycles were seized and are yet to get them back. They are blaming the commissioner as they claim he is responsible for the seizure of their property. The youths were in fact chanting ‘Bamayin Samuel Aruwan’ and not Bamayin Tinubu as suggested by the authors of the posts.”', '19-12-2022', 'https://trustcheck.dailytrust.com/did-kaduna-youths-protest-against-tinubus-presidential-bid/'),\n",
    "          ('Kogi State Governor Yahaya Bello has claimed that President Muhammadu Buhari has done well and has made Nigeria better than some developed countries.', 'FALSE', 'In verifying Yahaya’s claim, Daily Trust took a look at some key indices as criteria for determining whether Nigeria’s infrastructural development is doing better than some developed countries, and if it is doing well in general. In Nigeria, over 30 per cent of the total population is facing serious housing challenges, while 80 per cent of the country’s 206 million people live in informal housing, plagued by problems of poor quality and inadequate infrastructure. And most of the issues centre around affordability, proximity and unavailability of other basic amenities such as power, water and good road networks. In 2022, the unemployment rate in Nigeria is estimated to reach 33 per cent and chronological data show that the rate rose constantly in previous years. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, the labour force population covers all persons aged 15 to 64 years who are willing and able to work regardless of whether or not they have a job. The employed population was fixed at 46m; 20m for women and 26m for men. Individuals in informal employment were fixed at 43m, with 18m being women and 25m, being men. Those in formal employment out of the active population of 122m is a meager 3m; with less than 1m for women and about 2.3m for men. This leaves the number of unemployed Nigerians at 23m; 12m for women and 11m for men. The crisis in Nigeria’s power supply affectswother aspects of infrastructural development like mining, agricultural activities, and the industrial sector, among others. The national power grid has never experienced collapses as it has this year, showing that the country has a long way to go to improve the power sector. Data from the Debt Management Office (DMO) show that Nigeria’s debt profile stood at approximately N12.12 trillion as of June 2015, barely a month after Buhari assumed office. But according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the country’s foreign debt stood at $11.41 billion dollars, while its domestic debts were N14.02 trillion respectively in 2016, amounting to N17.5 trillion. However, Nigeria’s domestic debt stood at N20.95 trillion as of June 2022 alone. Data from the DMO revealed that domestic debt service in the first quarter of 2022 was N664.73 billion and N668.69 billion in the second quarter of the year. Conclusion: Going by some of the parameters that show a country’s infrastructure and economic development are intact and comparing them with some developed countries from 2015 to date, Daily Trust can confirm that Yahaya Bello’s assertion that Buhari made Nigeria better than some developed countries in infrastructure and economic growth is inaccurate.', '08-12-2022', 'https://trustcheck.dailytrust.com/has-buhari-made-nigeria-better-than-some-developed-countries-as-claimed-by-yahaya-bello/'),\n",
    "          ('The convoy of the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, was reported to have been attacked on October 9, 2022, during a campaign visit to Maiduguri, Borno State. The short report started trending on social media, with many claiming that over 70 people were injured and hospitalised.', 'FALSE', 'In a bid to validate the claim by Atiku (a former vice president) through his aide, Paul Ibe, that the hoodlums who attacked his convoy carried APC flags, Daily Trust reached out to some of the PDP presidential candidate’s media team for exclusive statements, but there was no response. However, a resident told this paper that hoodlums attacked the campaign team of the PDP along Airport Road and at Dalori Roundabout. He added that along Airport Road, some hoodlums hurled stones at the PDP vehicles. “The security operatives on the convoy fired shots into the air to disperse them. I think that was what Senator Melaye posted, claiming that gunmen have attacked their convoy,” the resident said. Further investigation revealed that the Borno police command had said the rally was held peacefully. The command, in a statement by its spokesman, ASP Sani Kamilu Muhammed, said the Commissioner of Police in the state, Abdu Umar, was physically present to supervise the place. “The command wishes to state authoritatively that the news is not only fake but also a false and mischievous attempt by some unguided people to incite disturbance and distract the peace of Borno people and Nigeria at large. “The campaign/rally was conducted successfully, as tight/adequate security coverage was emplaced throughout the activities. “The candidate and his party were accompanied to the Shehu’s palace by the police to pay a courtesy call, after which they were escorted until they departed the town,” he said. Conclusion: Daily Trust can confirm that there was actually an attack on Atiku’s convoy as claimed by the PDP but the number of people claimed to have been injured and hospitalised is misleading. In fact, nobody was admitted to any hospital. The number of vehicles allegedly vandalised is also false, even though the windscreens of some vehicles were smashed, as seen by our reporters at Ramat Square in Maiduguri. The claim by the Borno State chapter of the APC that there was no attack on the Atiku convoy is also not true. Similarly, the claim by the Borno State Police Command that there was no security breach in Maiduguri ahead of the PDP rally was misleading because the directive by the Inspector General of Police for a thorough investigation confirmed that the PDP convoy was attacked. In a nutshell, there was an attempt by some miscreants to disrupt the rally; and there was an attempt to cover it up, but it will be difficult to conclude who is behind it.', '17-11-2022', 'https://trustcheck.dailytrust.com/was-atikus-convoy-attacked-in-borno/'),\n",

    "          ('Reno Omokri, ex-aide to former President Goodluck Jonathan, has claimed that former governors of Lagos State who succeeded Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, are still loyal to the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate.', 'FALSE', 'While it can be said that former governor and incumbent Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Raji Fashola (SAN) is still loyal to Tinubu, there is strained relationship between Tinubu and ex-governor Akinwunmi Ambode. Fashola in an interview with Channels TV recently declared support for Tinubu to emerge president. Though, Ambode is still in APC, he has not publicly endorsed his former boss for the highest position in the country. Ambode and Tinubu fell apart after the latter was against the former’s re-election bid in 2019. Ambode’s second term ambition was frustrated by the APC governing council in the state, backed by Tinubu. He eventually lost the party’s primary to Tinubu’s preferred candidate, Babajide-Sanwo-Olu. Until he broke away from APC, Abdul-Azeez Olajide Adediran well known as Jandor was Tinubu and Fashola’s protégé. He was, however, aggrieved over the conduct of the APC ward, local and state congresses. Jandor consequently led a faction of APC called Lagos4Lagos Movement and defected to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) whose 2023 governorship ticket in Lagos he won. Similarly, Tinubu and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo had maintained close relationship since the Professor of law was appointed as Attorney-General of Lagos State during the Tinubu administration. Their relationship blossomed as Tinubu also played a major role in Osinbajo’s emergence as President Muhammadu Buhari’s running mate in 2014. However, many questioned Osinbajo’s loyalty to Tinubu when they competed for the APC presidential ticket which Tinubu eventually clinched. It was also believed that the ‘faltering relationship’ between the duo was responsible for the exclusion of Osinbajo from the Tinubu/Shettima Presidential Campaign Council list. However, the Director of Public Affairs and the chief spokesperson for the campaign council, Festus Keyamo said the vice president was excluded on the request of President Buhari so he (Osinbajo) could focus on governance. In the same vein, Senator Babafemi Ojudu used to be Tinubu’s loyalist. But Ojudu, who serves in the Office of the Vice President as Special Adviser on Politics to the President, declared that he was not in support of Tinubu’s ambition in the build-up to the APC presidential primary. The former lawmaker, who represented Ekiti Central Senatorial District between 2011 and 2015, in a statement titled, ‘Principled Political Choices are not Betrayal’, said he could not in good conscience support Tinubu for the presidency. He said, “I and Bola Tinubu have come a long way and we have been there for each other. So, let no one use my acknowledgment of his good deeds and my refusal not to support him in his bid for Nigeria presidency to portray me as a betrayer.” Also, Tinubu seems to have lost a staunch loyalty in former Osun State governor and Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola. Their ‘quarrel’ was partly attributed to the APC’s recent defeat in the governorship election in Osun State. Aregbesola did not support Tinubu’s annointed candidate, Gboyega Oyetola, during the July 2022 poll. Addressing his supporters in Ijebu-Ijesha ahead of the gubernatorial election, Aregbesola in a veiled reference to Tinubu, said, “Honestly, we followed and served this leader with all our might. Our loyalty to him had caused some people to start wondering if we were no longer Muslims. But we served him with sincerity and loyalty. If you regard anyone as your principal, you must serve him wholeheartedly. Sadly we didn’t know that while we wished him well, he didn’t think well of us. “Because we placed him higher than where he ordinarily should be, he started to think that he is our god. Unfortunately for him, we had sworn that we would beg God to bring down whoever compared himself to Him. Aregbesola had served as Commissioner for Works in Lagos State under Tinubu between 1999 and 2006. Thereafter, he went to Osun, his home state, to serve as governor. Based on available evidence, Omokri’s claim that Tinubu’s successors as Lagos governor and everyone who worked with him are still loyal to him is false. Although Tinubu still retains majority of his loyalists, including Fashola, there are a few instances where the relationship between him and some of his protégés has gone south.', '26-10-2022', 'https://trustcheck.dailytrust.com/are-all-tinubus-allies-still-loyal-to-him-as-reno-omokri-claimed/'),\n",

Reacting to the development at the time, Director of Media and Communication for the Tinubu Campaign Organisation, Bayo Onanuga, had disclosed that what was being peddled online, mostly via WhatsApp and Facebook, was not the manifesto of the APC presidential candidate, but a mere draft of suggestions on probable programmes Tinubu could implement if elected in February 2023. He said, “We have said it for the umpteenth time that it is not our manifesto. It is the same old viral document that people are still sharing as Tinubu’s manifesto.” In a detailed press release made available to newsmen, Onanuga had said, “Asiwaju Tinubu, in consultation with the party, experts in various fields and a broad section of the populace, through an empirical and evidence-based approach, is working on an all-embracing manifesto that will be presented to Nigerians when it is ready, before the official campaign begins in September.” The alleged manifesto prepared by former Deputy Governor of Lagos State, Olufemi Pedro and Legal Director of Tinubu Campaign Organisation, Babatunde Ogala, talked about improving security and creating hundreds of thousands of jobs. It also highlighted how Tinubu would transform Nigeria into an enviable country and one where there will be justice, peace and prosperity for all, with “a robust economy.” One of the signatories to the alleged manifesto, Ogala, had also confirmed that the viral document was just a compilation of suggested ideas packaged by friends. He said, “It is not Tinubu’s manifesto but personal input by a group of friends. How it found its way into the media is what I don’t know. “It becomes a manifesto when it is eventually put together and doesn’t carry anybody’s name but the candidate’s imprint.” No manifesto has been unveiled by the ruling party and its presidential candidate since the inauguration of a 65-man committee saddled with the responsibility of formulating the expectations of Nigerians to determine the manifesto of Tinubu in July. This is even as presidential campaign kicks off on Wednesday, September 28. A manifesto is a policy document in which a political party chronicles its plans, aims and the cardinal principles of its campaign and how those plans would be implemented if voted into power. It is made public to guide the masses on the agenda of a political party for the country and what should be expected while they are in power, thus giving a direction to the electorate. In conclusion: Daily Trust can confirm that the purported manifesto being touted as that of the APC presidential candidate, Ahmed Tinubu, is false. Several stakeholders at different times in the past had asserted that the document was only a draft and had not been endorsed by Tinubu. Also, the committee constituted to prepare the manifesto has not unveiled it to the public.', '27-09-2022', 'https://trustcheck.dailytrust.com/is-newly-circulated-tinubus-manifesto-authentic/'),\n",
    "          ('A spokesperson for the Atiku Abubakar presidential campaign, Daniel Bwala, has alleged that former Lagos State governor and presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, left behind a foreign debt of over $1bn when he completed his tenure in 2007.', 'FALSE', 'Information from the Debt Management Office (DMO) showed that the federal and state governments’ External Debt Stock as of June 30, 2016, was $11,261,887,684.00 with the Federal Government’s share of the debt portfolio standing at $7,607,500,252.76 while that of the states was $3,654,387,431.24. The three most indebted states were: Lagos with $1,431,474,719.70; Kaduna with $225,277,020.12 and Edo with $179,519,864.02. This was just the foreign debt profile. This prompted the then Lagos State Governor, Akinwunmi Ambode, to explain that the foreign debt owed by the state government at the time, was inherited from previous administrations before his tenure which began in 2015. Ambode who made the disclosure during an interview said that despite the numerous infrastructure the state government had planned to develop, the state’s Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) did not seek foreign option for financial support. He also noted that during his four-year tenure, his administration never took any foreign credit facility to run state activities. “Talking about Lagos State having the highest amount in terms of foreign loans, truth is that I have it on record that in my four years, I never took any foreign loan. So, whatever it is that they are saying about having $1.43 billion is an accumulation of loans that have been taken by successive governments,” he said. Recall that Ambode had two predecessors; Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu who served from 1999 to 2007 and Babatunde Raji Fashola who was governor between 2007 and 2015. As of 31 December 2018, statistics from the DMO showed that Lagos State’s total external debt stock stood at $1.43bn. The external debt comprised of $1.28bn from multilateral sources and $143.83 million as bilateral, sourced mainly from the African Development Bank. Comparing both data, one could easily see that Lagos’ foreign debt did not rise between June 2016 and December 2018. However, data compiled by the DMO showing both federal and states’ external debt stock as of December 31, 2007, revealed that Lagos State owed a total of $243,283,449.01 which is approximately $243 million as against the figure quoted by Bwala. It should be noted that at this time, Tinubu had handed over to his successor, Babatunde Fashola (SAN).

In the video, Mrs Tinubu, clad in Ankara attire with a scarf to match,  was in the company of other individuals who were laughing as she boasted that the deities of Lagos would be summoned to drive out the Igbos. The video has generated several reactions. She said the Igbos residing in the state “were proving difficult despite the love shown to them.”', 'MOSTLY CORRECT', 'Preliminary investigations by Daily Trust revealed that the video is an old one being recirculated. The video was shot in 2019 ahead of the general elections held at the time. Though Senator Remi spoke in Yoruba language, many tweeps and those who reacted to her comments say her tone was only misjudged and the whole conversation misconstrued to achieve an ulterior motive. One Twitter user, @BadmusAdeyemi12 said, “She was just joking in the video. She didn’t mean what she was saying. That could be seen in her gesture.” On his part, @4eyedmonk said, “…How can you say Remi Tinubu hates Igbo when in the same video she said, ‘Pelu ba she nife yin to,’ meaning, ‘considering how much we love you Igbo?’” Similarly, the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) where she serves as a pastor has reacted to the viral video. This is even as some individuals have called out the Senator and pastor for featuring in different ‘hateful’ videos. Some also questioned the status of her ordination. A Twitter user @Nwafresh wrote: “For the fact that Remi Tinubu is an ordained pastor in RCCG and still maintains her position after different hateful videos against the Igbo makes me understand why the Bible said that judgment will start from the house of God. Remi is an Antichrist.” The RCCG Head of Media and Public Relations, Pastor Olaitan Olubiyi who spoke with The Punch said the church was not aware of the video. He said, “We are not aware(of the video) and I’m sure Remi Tinubu was not speaking as a pastor of the Redeemed Christian Church of God.” “I’m not in a position to answer that because the church knows what it considers before ordination and social media does not dictate to the church what the church should do. She has her life,” he concluded. The video is actually true but old. However, it is being interpreted by many on social media as a fresh statement by the senator.

In March, INEC had also redeployed 385 employees nationwide, as part of efforts to ensure efficient and optimal performance. The affected workers were either serving in their states of origin or had served for between 10 and 32 years in the same state.', '26-09-2022', 'https://trustcheck.dailytrust.com/was-inec-former-ict-director-demoted-as-charly-boy-claimed/'),\n",
    "          ('Was Engr Chidi Nwafor demoted?', 'FALSE', 'Perusing the statement issued by Festus Okoye, one could easily find that Engr Chidi was not the only director who was redeployed, as seven other directors were also affected by the shakeup. Contrary to claims in the public domain, apart from Nwafor who is now administrative secretary, Enugu State, Mr Jude Okwuanu, administrative secretary, Enugu State was moved to Anambra State as administrative secretary while Usman Musa Wase, who was acting director, Human Resource Management, Headquarters, Abuja is now acting administrative secretary, Nasarawa State. Others are Barr. Waziri Zanna, acting administrative Secretary, FCT now acting director, Human Resource Management, Headquarters, Abuja; and Godwin Wada Edibo, acting administrative secretary, Nasarawa State now acting administrative secretary, FCT. Recall that in 2020, Mr. Osaretin Imahiyereobo, INEC’s former Director of Voter Education in Plateau State was also redeployed to take over as Administrative secretary in Bayelsa state. Reacting to Nwafor’s redeployment, Prof. Mohammad Kuna, the Special Adviser to the INEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu said the exercise was normal. He made this known during a panel discussion at a two-day workshop theme, ‘The role and impact of digital technologies in facilitating peaceful elections in Nigeria’ organised by the National Peace Committee (NPC), headed by a former Head of State, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar (retd) and The Kukah Centre in Abuja recently. Kuna said, “INEC has 37 offices across the federation and 774 local government offices across the local government areas in the country. It has over 16,000 staff spread across the country. The deployment and redeployment of staff is a normal exercise. “INEC reserves the right to deploy its staff in places it thinks they can best perform the task given to them. Before this latest redeployment, there had been massive redeployment of over 500 staff members that didn’t raise any concern. “This is necessary to help the commission to deal with the issues coming out of the 2023 elections. Every general election, these redeployments are normal. We did it in 2010, 2018, and we have done that of 2022. I don’t think this is abnormal.” In the same vein, the chairman of IPAC, the umbrella body of all the political parties in Nigeria, Yabagi Sani, said there is no cause for alarm over the changes in INEC and that no one is indispensable. He said, “Is there anyone that cannot be changed? Nobody is indispensable. Even though everybody’s contribution is required, nobody is indispensable. INEC as an organisation is alive to its activities. As you know, anything can happen. Individuals can die, or resign from office. What will you do in that case? IPAC commends the effort of INEC which shows that it is alive to its responsibilities.” Similarly, the Executive Director of Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre (CISLAC), Awwal Musa Rafsanjani said “It is in line with what we have recommended to INEC, that they must change some of their personnel in order to give confidence to Nigerians and prevent connivance with politicians. “We have advised INEC on the possibilities of carrying out such reform and staff audit to create more confidence in the system. In the past, there have been some allegations (of collusion to manipulate elections) involving some staff. “This reshuffling is in line with what TMG and some other CSOs wanted. If INEC is in doubt with some staff members, it needs to redeploy them since we were asking INEC to do something that will give more confidence to Nigerians because we didn’t want any suspicion that would emerge in the 2023 general elections.” Demotion vs Redeployment: Workforce redeployment is when a staff member leaves their old role and assumes a new one within the same organisation. This could mean that they are taking a completely new role with a new title, are moving to a new location, or will start working with a new team. It all depends on the needs of the company and the worker’s strengths. Demotion on the other hand is a compulsory reduction in an employee’s rank or job title within the organisational hierarchy of a company, public service department, or other body. A demotion may also lead to the loss of other privileges associated with a more senior rank and/or a reduction in salary or benefits. An employee may be demoted for violating the rules of the organization. In conclusion: Contrary to the claim by Charly boy that the former ICT director of INEC, Nwafor, was demoted, Daily Trust can confirm that the claim is false as he is still a director with INEC as categorized by the Nigeria Civil Service Commission. Nwafor was only redeployed from one department to another, which is normal in every formal organization. In addition, the post of administrative secretary is a directorate-level position.', '26-09-2022', 'https://trustcheck.dailytrust.com/was-inec-former-ict-director-demoted-as-charly-boy-claimed/'),\n",

According to data from the World Health Organization (WHO), in 2003, three (2.65) doctors were available to attend to 10,000 people in the country. But the number peaked at four (4.49) in 2016 and (3.81) in 2018. Also, a recent report by WHO revealed that for every 10,000 persons in Nigeria, there are four doctors available to treat or attend to them. However, WHO’s recommendation of doctor-patient ratio is one doctor per 600 patients. WHO data on global doctors’ population among countries has shown that some African countries have more doctors to attend to their population than Nigeria. The WHO’s data capture countries’ ratio of available doctors per 10,000 people in each nation. Mauritius (27 doctors in 2020), Tunisia (13 in 2017), Cape Verde (8 in 2018), South Africa and Egypt (7 each in 2019), Gabon (6 in 2018) have more doctors to attend to their populations than Nigeria. Although Nigeria has more doctors compared with some other countries within the same African region such as Angola, Kenya, Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Cameroon and Niger. As of 2018, Angola and Kenya had two doctors ratio of 10,000 population. In 2019, Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali and Cameroon had less than one doctor ratio per 10,000 population. And, Niger has had less than a doctor to 10,000 citizens since 2004. In November 2021, the Nigeria Medical Association (NMA) President, Innocent Ujah, had in his address at the virtual eighth biennial and scientific conference and annual general meeting of the Medical Women Association of Nigeria (MWAN), Kaduna state chapter, noted that “the current doctor to population ratio in the country is about one doctor to between 4,000 and 5,000 population. “This falls short of the one doctor to 600 population as recommended by the World Health Organisation. This means that we need about 303,333 medical doctors now, and at least 10,605 new doctors annually to bridge the manpower gap in the health sector,” he said. The Executive Director of a cancer advocacy group, Project PINK BLUE, Runcie Chidebe had disclosed last year that Nigeria will have a shortage of 50,120 doctors and 137,859 nurses by 2030 due to mass migration of health workers to foreign countries. He noted that in Nigeria, the density of physicians to a patient is 4 doctors per 10,000 patients and 16.1 nurses and midwives per 10,000 patients, which he said is less than the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations of 1 doctor to 600 patients and the critical threshold of 23 doctors, nurses and midwives per 10,000 patients. Corroborating this, the Executive Director/Chief Executive Officer of the National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA), Dr Faisal Shuaib, told journalists at a primary healthcare summit in Abuja in March this year that: “Today, only approximately 43 per cent of Nigerians have access to quality primary healthcare services with only about four doctors available per 10,000 people, a fraction of the minimum rate recommended by the United Nations (UN) for basic health coverage. It is widely recognized that 70 per cent of disease burden can be prevented and managed at the PHC (Primary Health Care) level.” Another survey conducted by the Nigeria Health Watch and NOI Polls showed that Nigeria had a deficit of qualified doctors and needs at least 237,000 doctors to ensure the population’s health needs are adequately catered for.', '26-09-2022', 'https://trustcheck.dailytrust.com/are-there-enough-doctors-in-nigeria-as-health-minister-ehanire-claimed/'),\n",

However, unlike Raila Odinga’s Azimio la Umoja – a registered coalition party – Kenya Kwanza is an alliance of parties. The founding political parties are Ruto’s United Democratic Alliance (UDA), Musalia Mudavadi’s Amani National Congress (ANC) and Moses Wetangula’s Forum for Restoration of Democracy Kenya (Ford Kenya). UDA, initially called the Party of Development Reforms officially changed its name to UDA in December 2020. The party became notable in January 2021 and is linked to politicians loyal to Ruto. Born on 21 December 1966, Ruto currently serves as the deputy president of Kenya, a position he has been occupying since 2013 when he was elected in a joint ticket with President Uhuru Kenyatta under the Jubilee Alliance. During his time on campus as an undergraduate, Ruto was an active member of the Christian union. He also served as the Chairman of the University of Nairobi’s choir. It is through his church leadership activities at the University of Nairobi that Ruto met President Daniel Arap Moi who introduced him to Kenyan politics during the 1992 general elections. Ruto began his political career when he became the treasurer of the YK’92 campaign group that was lobbying for the re-election of President Moi in 1992, from where he learned the ropes of Kenyan politics. On October 6, 2014, Ruto was appointed acting president of Kenya by President Uhuru Kenyatta after Kenyatta was summoned to appear before the International Criminal Court. In the August 2017 general elections, Uhuru and Ruto were declared victors after garnering 54 per cent of the total votes cast. However, the Supreme Court of Kenya nullified the election, and a fresh poll was held in October 2017. The opposition boycotted the fresh election and Kenyatta and Ruto were re-elected with 98 per cent of the total votes cast. The Supreme Court upheld the results of this second election. Kenyatta and Ruto however seemed to have fallen apart after they won re-election in 2017, and this would play a big part in Ruto’s push for the presidency. Ruto used his fallout with Kenyatta to solidify his support base, tapping onto his Rift Valley backyard and Uhuru’s Mount Kenya region. On December 2020 Ruto announced his alliance with the newly formed United Democratic Alliance Party. Before winning the 2022 presidential election, Ruto was a Member of Parliament (MP) from 1998 to 2013. He served as the Minister for Home Affairs in the Daniel Arap Moi administration from August to December 2002. He later served in the Mwai Kibaki administration as Minister of Agriculture from 2008 to 2010 and as Minister for Higher Education from April to October 2010.

Also, Amnesty International Kenya and other groups had in a statement, urged Kenyans to consider all results as provisional until the electoral commission announces the official results to reduce the risks of violence or claims of rigging.

Odinga, a long-time opposition leader is on his fifth attempt and he is backed by former rival and outgoing President Uhuru Kenyatta. The other top contender is Deputy President William Ruto, who fell out with the president earlier in their decade in power.

Enemeri blamed the crisis rocking the SDP at the national level and indifference of the national secretariat to the plight of members of the party in the state for his decision and urged members of the party at all levels to immediately move to the LP. He said, “The crisis at the national level has destabilised everything about the SDP in all the states of the federation and it has created crisis and factions and we cannot continue to suffer for them particularly here in Benue SDP just like we suffered for the party in 2018/2019.” He also maintained that “No kobo was sent to us to work for the party; and by the party’s constitution,  we were supposed to get not less than N75 million from the sale of forms in accordance with Section 72(2) but the people in Abuja sat on it.” He added, “In a party if you don’t win elections, what do you do? Now they are in court, let them continue. Benue is not a revenue-yielding state for them.” According to him, the LP candidate is a young man that has done very well in his constituency. Enemeri also said he had consulted with all other parties but that didn’t work, noting that “since we did not have a governorship candidate, we have decided to give our full support to Labour Party in Benue State.” But in a statement on Wednesday, the Vice Chairman of SDP in Benue State, Emmanuel Ibyabya, dismissed the report of collapsing its structures for the Labour Party in the state as Enemeri claimed, describing the report as false and mischievous. He said, “It is expedient to put on record that if it is the same John Enemari that we know, he was suspended by the party in January 2022 and later expelled at the National Convention of the SDP on 8th June 2022 and has seized to be a member of SDP. “He, therefore, lacks the locus standi to act even as a member of the party. That John Enemari has been expelled from office as a disloyal and unfaithful party man, whose leadership was turning a pestilential hair on the skin of the party and his superiors is no longer news as this can be verified from the Independent National Electoral Commission and the SDP national secretariat. “Following his suspension and later expulsion; instead of showing remorse to rebuild his lost integrity, the former chairman decided to embark on mischief and unfruitful attempts to recruit elements with the aim to dismember the party. “As a sad venture, Enemari purportedly went further in the desperate attempt to convince one of the political parties of a planned defection with large followership, which, again failed on distrust. “While the state chapter of the Social Democratic Party is not interested in his political voyage, we wish the unsuspecting public to know that the SDP is not in talks or has contemplated alliance or merger with any political party. “SDP has since concluded its primary elections and the names of all candidates are well published by the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC and this information can be verified from the Benue state INEC offices. “The party is convinced of expected victories in the 2023 general elections as all of its candidates are credible and reliable enough to give the party the desired victory. “We however know that as a drowning politician, Enemari is desperately in search of anything to grasp and save face and might deceive any political party or person that does not know him well. “Let it be known that no member of the SDP has joined Labour Party or any other political party and we urge our members and sympathizers to be watchful, resolute and determined for victories in 2023. “SDP remains united and committed to social justice. The State Working Committee, as well as members of the party, are fully behind the state chairman.” Also, the national chairman of the party, Alhaji Shehu Gabam, said, “There is no truth in the merger story.

Sokoto was arrested with some members of his terrorist group after a gun battle with law enforcement operatives who raided the sect’s budding training camp in Taraba.

Also, APC stakeholders from the North West have maintained that Bola Tinubu should choose his running mate from the zone.

At the end of the meeting, APC’s National Vice Chairman (North West), Dr Salihu Lukman, issued a statement which reads in parts: “The meeting noted the contribution of the North West to the emergence and growth of the APC and its electoral viability, with the region providing about 39 per cent of the votes the APC recorded in the 2015 and 2019 presidential elections. “Therefore, the zone resolved to aggregate its interests and vital concerns and engage accordingly with the presidential candidate of the party.” A few days ago, Tinubu himself had noted during a presentation of the book, “Mr Speaker”, and unveiling of the Legislative Mentorship Initiative to mark the 60th birthday of Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila in Abuja, that he was still searching for a running mate. While admiring the cordial working relationship between Hon. Gbajabiamila and his deputy, Tinubu said, “I could see his deputy (Wase) sitting down there too.

I will need to learn from both of you, how you made the pair work because I’m still searching for my running mate.” In conclusion: though APC former welfare secretary, Kabiru Masari, was nominated as Tinubu’s running mate, it is believed he was nominated as a ‘placeholder’ to beat the Independent National Electoral Commission’s (INEC) deadline for the party to submit the names of its candidates.

At the grand finale of his presidential campaign at the International Conference Centre (ICC), Abuja on April 14, 2011, on the platform of the defunct Congress for Progressive Change (CPC), President Buhari had in an address titled, ‘Creating Hope for the Future’, said, “Today is exactly 18 weeks since I declared my intention to contest the presidential election, and I must say it has been a very memorable period of time for me. As always, being on the campaign trail has been for all of us a most educating experience. “For me, this campaign is doubly significant. First, because it is an election in which more clearly and more unambiguously than the previous two in 2003 and 2007, our victory is assured, as evidenced by the unprecedented turnout by the people and spontaneous popular acclaim all over the country. And, second, because this campaign is the third and last one for me; since, after it, I will not present myself again for election into the office of the president.” It is also on record that the president wept intermittently while delivering his 12-page speech. Four years later, Buhari reneged on his promise, contested once again, and this time, having built a broader coalition with the help of Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, won. The APC is one of the two major political parties in Nigeria – the other being the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). It was founded on February 6, 2013 from a merger of the three major political opposition parties at the time; the Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN), Congress for Progressive Change (CPC), All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP), a faction of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), and the new PDP, a faction of the PDP. The resolution was signed by Tom Ikimi, who represented the ACN, Senator Annie Okonkwo on behalf of APGA, the chairman of ANPP’s merger committee and former Kano State governor, Senator Ibrahim Shekarau and the chairman of CPC’s merger committee and current Senior Special Adviser to President Muhammadu Buhari on Media, Garba Shehu. The coalition received approval from the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) on 31 July 2013 to become a political party and subsequently withdrew the operating licenses of the three parties that merged (ACN, CPC and ANPP). It should be noted that Asiwaju played a huge role in the merger of 2013 as he rallied the South West geopolitical zone to massively support the new party. While it may be true that Mr. Tinubu pencilled down Prof. Osinbajo’s name for consideration as vice president in 2015, it cannot be ascertained if he single-handedly picked him for the position. Also, Tinubu’s claim that Dapo Abiodun wouldn’t have been the governor of Ogun State without him cannot be proven, though he played a reasonable part by mobilizing Ogun residents to vote for the governor.

The statement read, “Operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, today May 24, 2022, arrived at the Maitama, Abuja home of a former governor of Imo state, Senator Rochas Okorocha, to effect his arrest. “The move followed the refusal of the former governor to honour invitations after jumping the administrative bail earlier granted him by the Commission. “In the circumstances, the Commission is left with no option than to effect the arrest of Senator Okorocha and bring him to trial.”', '22-09-2022', 'https://trustcheck.dailytrust.com/apc-didnt-hold-presidential-screening-as-okorocha-claimed-during-efcc-siege/')]"
