The lowest price ($17.4 per day) was recorded in 1999 during the administration of former president Olusegun Obasanjo while the highest price was recorded in 2012 when it surged $109 per barrel during the administration of former president Goodluck Jonathan. A breakdown by Daily Trust from available data showed that as at 1999, crude oil price was about $17.4 per barrel. It further surged to $27.6 in 2000, and later dipped to $23.1 in 2001.

The president, in the interview aired by Channels TV, said Nigeria’s crude oil production from 1999 to 2014 averaged 2.1 million barrels per day at an average price of $100 per barrel. “I challenge so many of you to go and check with the central bank or NNPC; the production from 1999 to 2014 was 2.1 million barrels per day average production at the average cost of $100 per barrel,” the president said in response to enquiries made by Channel’s Seun Okinbaloye. Similarly, in an interview with Arise TV in June 2021, the president made the same false claims. He stated this while hosting Dr. Reuben Abati, Tundun Abiola and Segun Adeniyi of Arise Television. In the same vein, in an earlier interview in 2019, most interviews and speeches delivered by the president since 2016 have followed a similar line. For instance, the president in his speech to Nigeria’s Democracy Day celebration in 2016 stated that the average oil price was $100 per barrel from 2010 till 2014.

Speaking on Channels Television’s breakfast show ‘Sunrise Daily’ on Monday 17th April 2023, he noted that the Electoral Body’s announcement was insignificant according to the provisions of the Electoral Act of 2022. His words: “INEC cannot nullify an election that has been announced, they don’t have that power. Elections have been announced, it is out of their hands. The result has been announced by the REC. Section 65 does not operate in isolation, there is Section 149.”. On Sunday 16th April 2023, the Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) in Adamawa State announced Sen. Aishatu Dahiru Binani, candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), as the winner of the state supplementary governorship election held on 15th April 2023 in a controversial manner as collation was still ongoing. Her major challenger and candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Umaru Fintiri, was maintaining a lead of over 30,000 votes before the election was declared inconclusive on March 18th, 2023. The INEC headquarters in Abuja, however, nullified the announcement and transferred the collation to Abuja. Subsequently, on Monday 17th April 2023, the commission asked its REC, Hudu Yunusa, to stay away from its office in Adamawa state. CDD fact checkers understands that INEC cannot take further disciplinary action on the Adamawa Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) because he is an appointee of the president and only the president can terminate his appointment. However, the commission has written to the Inspector General of Police, Alkali Baba Usman, to investigate and prosecute Mr. Hudu Yunusa. In another development, Sen. Binani has approached a federal high court in Abuja, seeking an injunction to halt INEC from concluding the collation process. Checks by CDD fact checkers show that the Electoral Act 2022 in Section 65 clearly delegates such powers to the commission. The section of the Electoral Act states that the decision of the returning officer shall be final on any question arising from or relating to unmarked ballot paper; rejected ballot paper; and declaration of scores of candidates, or the return of a candidate: It, however, added that “Provided that the commission shall have the power within seven days to review the declaration and return where the commission determines that the said declaration and return was not made voluntarily or was made contrary to the provisions of the law, regulations and guidelines, and manual for the election. “A decision of the returning officer under subsection may be reviewed by an election tribunal or court of competent jurisdiction in an election petition proceeding under this Act.” On Section 149 of the Electoral Act which the lawmaker made reference to, public affairs analysts and lawyers say the section makes reference to officers who are duly and legally assigned responsibilities by the commission and not officers carrying out duties not assigned to them, as in the case of the Resident Electoral Commissioner of Adamawa State. Section 149 of the Electoral Act states that, “Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Act, any defect or error arising from any actions taken by an official of the commission in relation to any notice, form, or document made or given or other things done by the official in pursuance of the provisions of the Constitution or of this Act, or any rules made thereunder, remain valid, unless otherwise challenged and declared invalid by a competent court of law or tribunal,” However, speaking on the issue, a public affairs analyst said: “The returning officer is the individual referenced in Section 149 of the Constitution whose pronouncement on election result will stand and not a Resident Electoral Commissioner who has no business in announcing and returning a candidate to office.” The analyst added that “INEC appointed a returning officer for the Adamawa State governorship supplementary election who is expected to declare results and not the resident electoral commissioner who just committed an illegality by going ahead to announce results that were still being collated.” Also speaking on the morning show on Arise Television on Tuesday, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Bolaji Ayorinde, said what the Resident Electoral Commissioner of Adamawa (REC), Hudu Yunusa, did is illegal and INEC did the right thing to declare it null and void. He said, “Mr. Hudu usurped the powers of the returning officer by going ahead to declare elections, and Section 149 of the Electoral Act only made reference to returning officers and not resident electoral officers, as such, it was right for INEC to nullify the results.” He added that but for the fact that Nigeria’s laws are weak, “the REC in Adamawa ought to have been arrested and facing prosecution.', '25-04-2023', 'https://cddfactcheck.org/?p=21055'),\n",

    "          ('Iyorchia Ayu lose his polling unit and Local Government Area in the 2023 elections.', 'PARTLY TRUE', 'In a recent television interview, Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State affirmed his support for the suspension of the National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Iyorchia Ayu. He said the people rejected PDP because Ayu refused to resign from the party’s chairmanship position. “I am in support of the suspension. In fact, if he (Ayu) had left before now, they would have said he has left and that was why the PDP failed the election,” the governor said. “First of all, if you are a member of the party, will you be happy with the way the party is today? It is only in this country that you see someone who has failed woefully and without any conscience would still like to occupy the position. “Those in his ward from Benue are angry; why were they angry before now? Ayu ought to have left that office. People were saying we were pushing for Ayu to leave and that we had a hidden agenda to make PDP fail. “Ayu remained and PDP didn’t win, you lost your unit as national chairman, you lost your local government,” Wike said. CDD Fact-checkers on Sunday 23rd April 2023 checks show that Ayu won his polling unit for Atiku Abubakar, the presidential candidate of the PDP during the presidential elections. However, he didn’t win the entire local government. CDD fact-checkers report on how major political parties’ stakeholders fared at their respective polling units in the 2023 polls showed that PDP won in Ayu’s polling unit. The election result at Mkovour Market PU 10 in Ipav District, Gboko Local Government Area of Benue State, where Ayu voted, showed that the PDP won the majority of the votes cast. In the presidential election, Atiku scored 190 votes, leaving APC and LP with seven and four votes, respectively. For the senatorial election, PDP had 192 votes while APC and LP polled five votes each. PDP polled 196 in the House of Representatives, leaving APC with 9 votes and LP 1. At the local government level, Gboko LGA election results showed that the APC won with 35,149 votes, followed by LP with 18,615 votes. PDP had 13,901 votes. Senator Iyorchia Ayu stepped aside as the chairman of the party last month following his suspension by the party executives in his ward. Ayu was replaced by the Deputy National Chairman (North), Umar Iliya Damagum. Recall that a High Court in Makurdi, the Benue state capital, had restrained embattled Ayu from parading himself as chairman of the party pending the determination of the substantive suit which has been adjourned to April 17, 2023 for hearing. A member of the PDP from Benue, Terhide Utaan, who is the plaintiff before Justice W. I Kpochi, obtained the order restraining Ayu from parading himself as national chairman of the party. However, Justice Wilfred Kpochi adjourned the suit to April 28, 2023.', '27-04-2023', 'https://cddfactcheck.org/?p=21099'),\n",
