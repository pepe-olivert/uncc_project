          "According to Ms Katongo, the President and Vice President are exempted because they are not subject to the provisions of the Public Order Act and therefore, all politicians whether from the ruling party or the opposition should not emulate what the Head of State is doing, which is distribution of face masks<br>",

          "However, in a call made by iVerify to Mr<br>",
          "Sakwiba Sikota, he stated that he disagreed with the guidelines issued by ECZ, arguing that the ECZ statement is not supported by the Constitution<br>",
          "According to him, articles 20 and 21 of the Zambia Constitution are included in part 3, which make them supreme over other parts of the constitution as they are entrenched provisions<br>",
          "He continued that, even if there was an article amended in the constitution which then would touch upon the rights which are protected in part 3, those amended articles would not have an effect because part 3 can only be changed after a referendum and other requirements<br>",
          "Therefore, in the event that ECZ was to disqualify candidates, Mr<br>",
          "Sikota stated that candidates would be able to sue on the basis of articles 20 and 21<br>",
          "He emphasized that the Constitution cannot contradict itself; the Constitution incorporates a self-correcting mechanism as part 3 overrides seemingly contradictory positions, thus ensuring that there is no contradiction in the constitution<br>",

when the loan for the rehabilitation of the Mulungushi Conference Center for the hosting of the 2022 African Union Heads of State Summit was contracted<br>\",\"In the Hansard , Mrs<br>\",\"Mwanakatwe, clarified that the support of the People\\u2019s Republic of China for the construction of a modern and multi-purpose conference facility for the hosting of the 2022 African heads of state Summit is a grant, and not a loan<br>\",\"Mwanakatwe further reiterated that the People\\u2019s Republic of China\\u2019s decision to extend this support followed the Zambian government\\u2019s request for assistance and emphasized that as Minister of Finance (then), she was the authority officer who signed notes of exchange and grants, and contract loans on behalf of government, and assured the House that she signed the notes of exchange for the grant of the construction of the new Mulungushi Conference Center<br>\",\"Therefore, the claim by UPND-UK Chapter online Facebook page is false, that construction is being funded from money borrowed by the former ruling Patriotic Front government, when it is rather a grant<br>\",\"The fact checking process has determined as false the claim that

affecting Chama North Constituency<br>\",\"Further, the Order Paper did not indicate that the President would appear in the National Assembly as claimed in the Kalemba article<br>\",\"Therefore, the claim that President Hichilema was, on 2nd December, 2021, scheduled to answer questions from Members of Parliament in the National Assembly to mark 100 days of the President being in office, is false<br>\",\"The fact checking process has determined as unproven the claim that UPND cadres repainted the name of Nathan Chanda from the Nathan Chanda police post in Luanshya<br>\",\"The video

means that there should be no overlap in the powers and functions of the different arms of Government<br>\",\"It sets limits on the work of the Judiciary, the Legislature and the Executive; and it provides checks and balances that prevent abuse of power by any of the three arms of government<br>\",\"In line with the claim by John Sangwa SC, the current process has lacked semblance of

Smart Eagles that election petitions have put President Hakainde Hichilema and the UPND victory under self-sabotage<br>\",\"An election petition is a procedure for inquiring into the validity of the election results of Parliamentary or local government elections<br>\",\"According to the laws of Zambia it is a constitutional right, meaning an election petition is under law to challenge the election of a candidate in a Parliamentary, Assembly or local election<br>\",\"Therefore according to article 73 (1) of the Constitution of Zambia, a person may file an election petition with the High Court to challenge the election of a Member of Parliament, which the UPND and any aggrieved party that participated in the just ended general election is at liberty to contest if they are displeased with the outcome of elections, regardless of their political affiliation but rather, based on their constitutional right as is guided<br>\",\"The fact checking process has further established that

these reports by the international organizations, all made mention of the election as technically managed but marred with unequal campaign conditions, restrictions on freedom of assembly and movement

unequal campaign conditions are the reason and justification for the petition, and if not addressed, are what actually undermine the integrity of the electoral process<br>\",\"In his petition, the concerns raised by Mr Kanengo are in line with the observations that were made by the international organizations<br>\",\"It can therefore be stated that the overwhelming number of petitions by the

is the offense of being disobedient to or disrespectful toward a court of law and its officers in the form of behavior that opposes or defies the authority, justice, and dignity of the court<br>\",\"During court proceedings, an individual or the parties involved are restricted from giving out or commenting on any issues that are actively on going as this has the potential to

is true that ZICTA could not speculate or comment on the internet shut down on the 12th and 13th of August 2021, the claim by the PF is misleading as the PF misquoted the authority<br>\",\"ZICTA

Intercity bus terminus and the suspects are detained for obtaining money by false pre-tenses and will appear in court soon<br>\",\"The receipt branded with UPND details cannot prove beyond reasonable doubt that the individuals collecting money are UPND cadres as anyone is at liberty to print on receipts the details of any political party, therefore as guided by the police, the affiliation of the individuals to a political party will only be fully determined when they appear in court<br>\",\"Finally, in corroborating this incident, Republican President Mr Hakainde Hichilema on his Facebook page had expressed displeasure with the reports that there are still incidents of people who are posing as political cadres continuing to illegally collect fees, terming the acts as unacceptable<br>\",\"He added that the police do not need to be prompted as they have full powers to arrest such individuals and further encouraged traders to ensure they report those individuals to

conclude that the assault did not happen at Civic Center but rather in Kafulamase area which is three kilometers away from Kabwe civic Centre<br>\",\"The iVerify team contacted the Central Police

neither did they receive any report of ballots that had been tempered with at the Civic Center<br>\",\"Therefore, based on this information, the iVerify team neither conclude the claim by Zambian

Mr<br>\",\"Siwale, had established that no arrest of Mr<br>\",\"Namawa had been recorded on accusation of being in possession of pre marked ballot papers<br>\",\"A separate call from iVerify to Crown TV has established that the alleged boxes were not ballot papers but boxes containing phones for the Patriotic Front<br>\",\"The fact finding process has established as true the claim by Mr Chabala that he had withdrawn his candidature for Mandevu Constituency, and his reasons for withdrawing<br>\",\"The iVerify team called Mr Chabala on 28th July 2021, and he confirmed withdrawing from the parliamentary race, and that his reasons in the letter addressed to ECZ dated 21st July 2021 still stood valid<br>\",\"He said the major reason for his withdrawal were the threats he received<br>\",\"Mr Chabala mentioned that the playing field was uneven and it favored a few candidates who were able to campaign freely and safely whilst disadvantaging others, inclusive of him<br>\",\"In responding to allegations made by Zambia Reports concerning political violence, Mr Chabala confirmed that there was indeed violence in Mandevu but he however did not state any political party inciting it<br>\",\"A further analysis by iVerify showed that various stakeholders such as the Patriots for Economic Progress Party (PEP) condemned the destruction of property and assault on innocent citizens caused by unsuspecting party members in Mandevu constituency in Lusaka<br>\",\"Southern African Centre for the Constructive Resolution of Disputes (SACCORD) Executive Director Boniface Cheembe also added that democratic processes premised on violence would not help Zambians make an informed decision in terms of which party to vote for and condemned the violence in Mandevu<br>\",\"In addition to this, Inspector General of police Mr Kakoma Kanganja stated that the police have time and again advised political parties to ensure that they conduct themselves peacefully and within the confines of the law during their public activities as well as when other political parties undertake their activities<br>\",\"In referring to an earlier incident that had occurred in Mandevu on 10th June, Mr Kanganja stated that what transpired in Mandevu Compound in Lusaka where suspected Patriotic Front cadres allegedly blocked some portions of the road with a view to disrupt the authorised procession of the UPND was criminal and would not be condoned<br>\",\"Similarly, the conduct of some UPND cadres who were alleged to have damaged motor vehicles during their roadshow was criminal and prosecutable<br>\",\"He therefore directed Lusaka Province Police Command to ensure that all those involved in the confusion and criminal acts during the UPND roadshow in Mandevu were arrested and prosecuted<br>\",\"These acts of violence as well as condemnations made by various stake holders, including the police correspond to Chabala\\u2019s claims that serve as the main reason for stepping back from the parliamentary race<br>\",\"The Fact Checking process has determined as true the claims by the Ministry of Health Permanent Secretary, Dr<br>\",\"Kennedy Malama, that it is safe for breastfeeding mothers infected with COVID-19 to breast feed their babies<br>\",\"Aside the prescribed precautions established by the Ministry of Health, such as masking up as well as hand hygiene during breast feeding, the iVerify Fact checking team further investigated various credible health research institutions to reinenforce the claim through various reports investigated to establish as true, that infected mothers can safely breast feed their babies as Coronavirus has not been found in breast milk<br>\",\"According to a 2020 scientific Brief by the World Health Organization (WHO), titled \\u2018Breastfeeding and COVID-19,\\u2019 a total of 46 mother-infant dyads had breastmilk samples tested from COVID-19 positive mothers<br>\",\"Breastmilk samples from 43 mothers were negative for the COVID-19 virus, while samples from 3 mothers tested positive for viral particles by RT-PCR<br>\",\"Among the 3 infants whose mothers\\u2019 breastmilk tested positive for virual RNA particles, not live virus, one infant tested positive for COVID-19 but infant feeding practices were not reported, a scientific trend that shows that breastmilk from a COVID-19 positive mother is safe as no COVID-19 has been detected<br>\",\"Another reference report investigated from the United Nations Children\\u2019s Emergence Fund (UNICEF) show that so far, the COVID-19 virus has not been found in breast milk and all mothers are advised to continue breastfeeding, while practicing good hygiene during feeding, which include Wear a mask during feeding,Wash hands with soap before and after touching the baby, Wipe and disinfect surfaces regularly<br>\",\"Reference made to another report investigated from the Centers for Disease Control and Preevention (CDC) shows that current evidence suggests that breast milk is not likely to spread the virus to the baby and that it is safe for infected mothers to brreastfeed as long as preventive measures are put in place<br>\",\"The fact checking process has established as false the claim made by Mr Anthony Bwalya that some ballot papers were missing at the Civic Centre in Lusaka<br>\",\"The iVerify fact checking considered concerns by several members of the public regarding missing ballot papers in Lusaka which has the potential to lead to voter apathy<br>\",\"The iVerify team studied the video being referred to by Mr Bwalya and made the observation that the video indeed shows some ballot boxes ripped around the areas fastened with a strapping tape, however it does not clearly show any ballot papers or the content therein and therefore cannot conclude that any ballot papers were missing from the spoilt boxes based on the particular video<br>\",\"Further verification showed that the Electoral Commission of Zambia has scheduled dates of distribution of ballot boxes which could not have facilitated the availability of the ballot boxes at Lusaka\\u2019s Civic Centre on the 6th of August as they are scheduled to be at Lusaka\\u2019s Civic Centre on the 9th of August<br>\",\"In fact, in a statement shared on their official facebook page, the ECZ through the District Electoral Officer Mr<br>\",\"Alex Mwansa confirmed that ballot papers are yet to be distributed in Lusaka, adding that according to the Electoral Commission of Zambia timetable, the distribution of ballot papers in Lusaka will take place on the 9th August 2021<br>\",\"Mwansa invited all stake holders to witness the distribution process of the ballot papers; calling on members of the public to desist from spreading falsehoods but rather seek clarity when they encounter information they deem suspicious<br>\",\"Furthermore, iVerify came across a statement by The Lusaka City Council through their Public Relations Manager Mwaka Nakweti on the 6th of August, in which it is statedthat the Council would like to distance itself from a video that is circulating on social media purporting that ballot boxes have gone missing from the Civic Center<br>\",\"Instead, if we are to place the video that is circulating on social media of missing ballot papers at Lusaka\\u2019s Civic Centre, in accordance with the ECZ timetable, the ballot boxes would have been in Chipata (Petauke) on the 5th of August,2021 in conformity with the date that thevideo was first circulated<br>\",\"iVerify corroborated the video to another video from Petauke district in which Emanuel JJ Banda, aspiring Member of Parliament for Petauke Central confirms receiving ballot papers as a district for Petauke central and Kaombwe constituency<br>\",\"Other invited stakeholders as well as the district electoral office (DEO) are seen to be present as well<br>\",\"In the video it is stated that in the process of offloading the ballot boxes, the officials present noted that some boxes were damaged and it brought about misunderstandings<br>\",\"However, the DEO calmed the situation by calling for a verification which indeed confirmed thatall ballot boxes had all ballot booklets as indicated Combining the statements by ECZ and the Lusaka City Council as well as a thorough reading of the two videos that serve as evidence of what really transpired, the iVerify team has determined as false the claim by Mr<br>\",\"The Fact Checking process by iVerify has determined as misleading the claim that President Edgar Lungu has blocked the UPND Alliance Presidential candidate, Hakainde Hichilema from campaigning<br>\",\"While there are indeed restrictions on campaign activities, those restrictions were put in place by the Zambia Police Services and the Electoral Commission of Zambia, which is an independent body<br>\",\"On the 27th of July, 2021, Inspector General of Police Kakoma Kanganja directed Police Officers across the country to strictly oversee the suspension of public rallies and processions, including those where face masks are being distributed<br>\",\"He said the political parties are using such activities to gather large crowds which were turning out to be processions or rallies thereby contradicting the Public Health guidelines and suspension of huge gatherings by the ECZ and the Ministry of Health<br>\",\"This was in line with announcement at the joint Ministry of Health and ECZ press briefing on 7th June, 2021 that all campaign rallies and all activities that may attract huge gatherings were suspended with immediate effect<br>\",\"While the directive counts for all political party candidates, it is important to note that in a live phone interview on Diamond TV\\u2019s Breakfast show that was broadcast on 28th July, 2021, Zambia Police spokesperson Esther Katongo said the Police regulation of activities does not apply to the Republican President and the Republican Vice President<br>\",\"According to Ms Katongo, the President and Vice President are exempted because they are not subject to the provisions of the Public Order Act and therefore, all politicians whether from the ruling party or the opposition should not emulate what the Head of State is doing, which is distribution of face masks<br>\",\"The statement is backed up by the Law of Zambia on Regulation of Assemblies, Public meetings and Processions, the Public Order Act Chapter 5 Subsection 6, which states that the provisions of subsections (4) and (5) shall not apply to any public meeting convened by or at the request of and intended to be addressed by the President, the Vice-President or any Minister or Junior Minister or the Speaker or Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly<br>\",\"In summary, the iVerify team considers the claim that Mr<br>\",\"Hichilema has consistently been stopped from campaigning by the President as misleading given that the current restrictions in place count for all political parties and leaders, with the exception of the President as per the Constitution<br>\",\"In addition, the restrictions have been implemented and enforced by independent government institutions<br>\",\"The claim by Mr<br>\",\"Sakwiba Sikota that ECZ guidance to independent candidates is wrong, as reported on Smart Eagles, is inconclusive<br>\",\"An observation made by iVerify showed that the statement made by ECZ is a word for word quote of the Constitution of Zambia<br>\",\"The ECZ further goes on to interpret this guidance of independent candidates to necessary stakeholders<br>\",\"In reference to article 20 which states, \\u201c(1) except with his own consent, no person shall be hindered in the enjoyment of his freedom of expression, that is to say, freedom to hold opinions without interference, freedom to receive ideas and information without interference, freedom to impart and communicate ideas and information without interference, whether the communication be to the public generally or to any person or class of persons, and freedom from interference with his correspondence\\u201d, the statement by ECZ does not stop independent candidates from holding opinions or enjoying their freedom of expression<br>\",\"The statement by ECZ in turn advises independent candidates to desist from using campaign materials for political parties or in any way identify themselves with any political party as they are contesting based on independent candidacy<br>\",\"Furthermore, in relation to article 21 of the constitution of Zambia on freedom of assembly and association, which states that \\u201cexcept with his own consent, no person shall be hindered in the enjoyment of his freedom of assembly and association, that is to say, his right to assemble freely and associate with other persons and in particular to form or belong to any political party, trade union or other association for the protection of his interests\\u201d, the statement by ECZ again does not stop independent candidates from assembling or associating<br>\",\"Instead, the statement warns against \\u201caffiliation\\u201d which is as guided by the Zambian Constitution<br>\",\"Another observation made by the iVerify team relates to the fact that Mr<br>\",\"Sakwiba Sikota says to have been running under the United Liberial Party for the 2006 Livingstone Parliamentary Race, while in 2008 and 2011, he was on the same campaign platform as Rupiah Banda all around the country<br>\",\"Rupiah Banda would wear the Movement for Multipary Democracy (MMD) attire and Mr Sikota would adorn himself in the ULP campaign regalia<br>\",\"This observation implies that Mr<br>\",\"Sikota did not contest as an independent candidate but under the United Liberal Party, therefore not breaching any law as this article of independent candidates in the Zambian constitution as well as ECZ\\u2019s recent statement does not apply to him<br>\",\"The example he gave in the article can therefore be considered misleading to independent candidates<br>\",\"However, in a call made by iVerify to Mr<br>\",\"Sakwiba Sikota, he stated that he disagreed with the guidelines issued by ECZ, arguing that the ECZ statement is not supported by the Constitution<br>\",\"According to him, articles 20 and 21 of the Zambia Constitution are included in part 3, which make them supreme over other parts of the constitution as they are entrenched provisions<br>\",\"He continued that, even if there was an article amended in the constitution which then would touch upon the rights which are protected in part 3, those amended articles would not have an effect because part 3 can only be changed after a referendum and other requirements<br>\",\"Therefore, in the event that ECZ was to disqualify candidates, Mr<br>\",\"Sikota stated that candidates would be able to sue on the basis of articles 20 and 21<br>\",\"He emphasized that the Constitution cannot contradict itself; the Constitution incorporates a self-correcting mechanism as part 3 overrides seemingly contradictory positions, thus ensuring that there is no contradiction in the constitution<br>\",\"In conclusion, iVerify rates this justification as inconclusive as it is ultimately up to the courts of law to determine whether the statement issued by ECZ is is in line with the Constitution or contradictory and infringing on entrenched rights<br>\",\"The process of fact finding has established the depiction of corruption in Zambia by the FIC to be true<br>\",\"As presented on page 15 of the Financial Intelligence Centre (FIC) report, the number of reports received amount to 14, with a total value of K2,228,000,000 lost
