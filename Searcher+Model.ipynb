Following remarks from the members of the public on social media platforms criticizing the President’s recent meeting with the Pope at the Vatican, the Chief Government Spokesperson Chushi Kasanda in a statement, also clarified that President Hakainde Hichilema did not visit the Vatican as an Adventist but as a Head of State whose citizens belong to various religious persuasions including Catholics and is a president for all Zambians, who belong to different denominations. According to a press release from the Office of the President Press and Public Relations dated 23 November 2022, President Hichilema has, pursuant to Section 5(1) of the Electoral Commission of Zambia Act No. While the directive counts for all political party candidates, it is important to note that in a live phone interview on Diamond TV’s Breakfast show that was broadcast on 28th July, 2021, Zambia Police spokesperson Esther Katongo said the Police regulation of activities does not apply to the Republican President and the Republican Vice President\",\n",
       " 'iVerify has determined as true reports that Cyclone Freddy may affect Zambia. The Disaster Management and Mitigation Unit (DMMU) in the Office of the Vice President issued a statement to alert and warn the public about Cyclone Freddy and the impending risks and the need to take early action to avert or minimize loss to human lives as well as damage to property, livelihoods and the environment. iVerify further consulted the IMF Office in Zambia Website, and as at close of business on 23 March 2022, the Fund had not published any statement,  press releases or reports substantiating the claim that the IMF bailout program for Zambia has collapsed, following a recent review of the Staff Level Agreement and Extended Credit Facility of $1. iVerify Zambia arrived at this conclusion after Dr. To further fact-check the claim, iVerify Zambia contacted the Lusaka City Council (LCC)',\n",
       " 'According to the statement dated October 19 and signed by Judiciary of Zambia Public Relations Officer Kalumba Chisambisha-Slavin, the Judiciary was concerned with assertions circulating on social media platforms that the Judiciary had outsourced the Zambia Institute of Legal Advanced Education (ZIALE) to prepare and administer the aptitude test for Magistrate Class III held on October 13, 2022. iVerify Zambia has determined as misleading the pictures and statement by Kalbalika Facebook page and other social media platforms, alleging that Zambian schools were providing sexuality education that exposed learners to highly graphical sexual content. “Governor Wike is Not the Biological Father of His Three Kids, He cannot Father a Child,” reads a quote doing the rounds on Facebook in September 2022. Photos of burned-out offices and armed men on a truck are circulating on Facebook with the claim that the terrorist group Boko Haram has taken over Independent National Electoral Commission (Inec) offices in the two northern Nigerian states of Kano and Kaduna. In the case in question, the PF’s Nakacinda is allegedly to have defamed the President under Section 69 of the Penal Code, which states that: “Any person who, with intent to bring the President into hatred, ridicule or contempt, publishes any defamatory or insulting matter, whether by writing, print, word of mouth or in any other manner, is guilty of an offence and is liable on conviction to imprisonment for a period not exceeding three years',\n",

After Nigerians voted to pick a new president and federal legislators, a claim that president-elect Bola Tinubu was Nigeria’s 16th president surfaced online. Screenshots circulating on Facebook in Nigeria appear to show the winner of an annual prize saying he hopes Nigeria’s president-elect Bola Tinubu will restore the country’s “stolen mandate”, while calling Tinubu’s rival Peter Obi “My President elect”. Therefore, the assertions by Frontlines Zambia and various online pages alleging that the former PF Kwacha Constituency MP Joe Malanji had grabbed all the furniture he donated to Bulangililo clinic, and two buses donated to two United Church in Zambia (UCZ) in Kwacha East, accusing the kwacha residents of being against him, is false',\n",

According to the statement dated October 19 and signed by Judiciary of Zambia Public Relations Officer Kalumba Chisambisha-Slavin, the Judiciary was concerned with assertions circulating on social media platforms that the Judiciary had outsourced the Zambia Institute of Legal Advanced Education (ZIALE) to prepare and administer the aptitude test for Magistrate Class III held on October 13, 2022.

But in September, a rumour started circulating online that there was a plot to oust Tinubu if he won the presidency, and make Shettima president instead. But did the governing party’s presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, blame his own party for sabotaging his campaign by creating these problems?\\nHe did, according to a claim circulating on Facebook in Nigeria.

       " 'A video also fact checked by iVerify team posted by Parly ZED Facebook page on the Patriotic Front  secretariat attack, the Secretary General Davis Mwila in an interview at the PF Secretariat said that suspected political cadres had stormed the secretariat around 03:00Hours and various items which included computers, chairs, air conditioners, were stolen. In a video obtained from UPND Youths Zambia Facebook Page and fact checked by iVerify, UPND Youth National Chairperson, Gilbert Liswaniso did warn that if any one attacked and insulted President Hichilema on a personal level, they would be beaten and not be free in Lusaka. While the PF Secretariat was indeed attacked by people who wanted to disrupt a press briefing addressed by the PF Vice President, Given Lubinda, there is no evidence linking the attackers to the UPND. Therefore, the claim by the Patriotic Front-PF Facebook page that the three women arrested in Kitwe for making and later circulating a video having carnal knowledge of a mental patient at Mindolo market are members of the ruling UPND is unproven. While it is true that Minister Doreen Mwamba found over 200 mukula logs at Zapid Farms in Luapula Province, there is no evidence to prove nor disprove the claim that the drivers are affiliated to the Patriotic Front political party',\n",

The iVerify fact-checking process has determined as false the claim that Fred Membe’s wife, Mutinta Mazoka has been nominated as Member of Parliament by President Hakainde Hichilema. “Governor Wike is Not the Biological Father of His Three Kids, He cannot Father a Child,” reads a quote doing the rounds on Facebook in September 2022. The claim circulating on Facebook further alleges that Tinubu is marrying a Muslim because his wife Oluremi is considered to be an “infidel”. Therefore, the claim by the Zambian Telegraph that the New United Kingdom Monarch leader, King Charles III, had turned down a request by Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa to attend the official funeral of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II at Westminster is false']"
