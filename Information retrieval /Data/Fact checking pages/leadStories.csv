Historical records show that the claim is a well-documented hoax that dates to a Soviet disinformation campaign from the 1980s.The claim appeared in a December 3, 2022, post on Facebook under the headline, ""This doctor says he deliberately created AIDS to depopulate humanity at Ft. Dietrich Maryland."" It opened:Historic records prove the secret intensification of the of the biological weapons race in America make the Soviet efforts pale by comparison.

That's nearly half of the amount of money given to all of biological weaponry that year. These new laboratory creations were descriptively and functionally identical to HIV AIDS.Here's how the post appeared on the day of the writing of this fact check:(Source: Facebook screenshot taken Wed Dec 14 at 20:45:00 2022 UTC)The post's video footage is a collection of clips excepted from a 2007 movie -- ""In Lies We Trust: the CIA, Hollywood and Bioterrorism"" -- which was produced, written and narrated by Dr. Leonard G. Horowitz, a former dentist and known AIDS and vaccine conspiracy theorist, who runs a nonprofit for ""natural healthcare defense"" and a ""natural consumer products"" company.The claims expressed by Horowitz in the video posted on Facebook begin at the 50-minute mark of the 2:30-hour movie. The interviews and documents featured in the used in the 8:26 video appear to duplicate those from the film, although some on-screen graphics differ:A prime target of Horowitz's video is Dr. Robert Gallo, one of two scientists credited with discovering in the mid-1980s that HIV causes AIDS. Gallo, who co-founded the University of Maryland's Institute of Human Virology, was also the first researcher to develop a diagnostic blood test for the disease. In the video, Horowitz is heard questioning Gallo about whether his pre-1980 research may have triggered the emergence of HIV and AIDS. Horowitz claims the exchange occured during the 11th International Conference on AIDS in Vancouver, B.C., which took place July 7-12, 1996.Lead Stories used abstracts of online copies of conference presentations and outcome summaries, (here and here) to confirm the conference dates. An additional search of a copy of the conferrence program archived in the Jon Coen AIDS Research Collection at the University of Michigan Library, confirms Gallo was in attendance.""It's absurd,"" Gallo said, recalling his exchange with Horowitz in a telephone interview with Lead Stories on December 19, 2022. ""That's when I started to laugh my head off. I said, 'The guy is crazy and, if he's not crazy, he's a total fraud.'""According to Gallo, Horowitz's claims that HIV was made in a lab are wrong. HIV wasn't a new virus in the 1980s; researchers have found it was present as far back as the 1800s.""HIV existed -- we can prove it by [the] molecular clock, looking at its genome and rate of change -- approximately dating back a hundred and twenty years in man,"" said Gallo, whose previous research with human retroviruses led to significant advancements in understanding of T-Cells and the isolation of the first leukemia T-Cell virus.Additionally, the gene cloning technology (also known as recombinant DNA technology) which was critical to advancing scientific understanding and discovery related to HIV/AIDS, was not available until 1980.""You can't do any such experiments before the 1980s,"" Gallo said.The physician stressed that not once in his 30 years at the National Institutes of Health, where he headed the National Cancer Institute's Laboratory of Tumor Cell Biology, nor at any time during his medical education, was he asked to participate in a government plan to develop HIV/AIDS as some sort of biological weapon.""I never heard such a tale, ever,"" he said.HIV, or human immunodeficiency virus, attacks the human immune system and, if left untreated, can lead to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, or AIDS, according to information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Scientists agree that HIV was not created in a laboratory, but is instead related to the simian immunodeficiency virus, which was first documented in the blood of chimpanzees in west Central Africa in the 1950s and may have jumped to humans as early as the 1800s. The virus was first seen in human blood in the 1970s, years before AIDS was diagnosed as a disease in 1981 and developed into an epidemic primarily affecting gay men.During the 1980s, AIDS research was conducted at Fort Detrick, a military medical research facility in Fredericksburg, Maryland. From 1943 until 1969, when President Richard Nixon ended the country's biological weapons program, Fort Detrick had been used for bioweapons research. Nixon turned the facility's focus toward cancer research.Scientists at Fort Detrick were producing the HIV virus in order to provide blood tests for the disease as quickly as possible so that lives could be saved, Gallo said. ""The government was using our viruses to help scale up and make the blood tests"" Gallo told Lead Stories, adding that neither he, nor his team ever worked in the lab at Fort Detrick.Multiple media reports (here and here) from the time confirm the work of Fort Detrick scientists, but also describe early efforts to combat the Russian disinformation campaign. In a 1987 AP story, Fort Detrick officials called a Soviet state media report about the manufacture of AIDS for use as a biological weapon ""absolutely ridiculous.""According to the U.S. Department of State, the Soviet Union launched a coordinated, worldwide disinformation campaign in 1985 that spread the rumor that U.S. Army medical researchers had manufactured the AIDS virus for use as a biologial weapon. Historians, medical researchers, journalists and academics have documented this campaign.Part of the disinformation initiative included promoting the theories of a retired East German biology professor, Jakob Segal and his wife, Lilli, who published a paper claiming that Fort Detrick sources had said the Central Intelligence Agency had developed AIDS. The couple continued to press the theory into the 1990s.Lead Stories has fact checked other false claims about HIV/AIDS, (here and here), including a claim about Gallo and other scienitsts being forced to develop HIV to wipe out ethnic Africans.",False,"Dec 21, 2022"
SHARE THE SHIT OUT OF THIS!!!!,"Was the statement that HIV causes AIDS ""made Up""? No, that's not true: It's an established fact, proven by numerous scientific studies. However, posts on social media continue to claim otherwise.A recent example appeared on Facebook on December 15, 2022, under the text line:SHARE THE SHIT OUT OF THIS!!!!A video opened with a narrator saying:Under the premise that HIV was the probable cause of AIDSThe narration continued without providing any context:But when he went looking for the proof he found there was none. They just made it up.This is what the post looked like on Facebook at the time of writing:   (Source: Facebook screenshot taken on Tue Dec 20 15:45:30 2022 UTC)The video showed fragments of undated interviews of the now-deceased scientist Kary Mullis. During his lifetime, as a 2007 New York Times article pointed out, he was known for winning the 1993 Nobel Prize in Chemistry and for denying two things -- global warming, and the connection between HIV and AIDS.The claim is an example of HIV/AIDS denialism that began with a May 18, 1981, article published by a New York City-based gay medical doctor under the title ""Disease Rumors Largely Unfounded."" Ironically, as reported by NPR, ""it was the first-ever article about AIDS in a U.S. publication.""The disease was a new phenomenon that scientists were only beginning to understand.When the first papers appeared in scientific literature, they discussed the abnormal occurrence of particular illnesses in immunosuppressed people. One of the first 1981 CDC reports talked about cases of pneumonia caused by the fungus Pneumocystis Jirovecii (previously called Pneumocystis carinii, as in this report), which was extremely rare in the United States. Another 1981 paper brought up cases of Kaposi's sarcoma in patients younger than 40, even though it was previously known to be a cancer that affected significantly older populations.In 2022, however, a cause-and-effect relationship between HIV and AIDS is a proven fact.The CDC website says:HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is a virus that attacks the body's immune system. If HIV is not treated, it can lead to AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome).The National Institutes of Health explains:HIV attacks and destroys the infection-fighting CD4 cells (CD4 T lymphocyte) of the immune system. The loss of CD4 cells makes it difficult for the body to fight off infections and certain cancers. Without treatment, HIV can gradually destroy the immune system and HIV infection advances to AIDS.The Federal HIV/AIDS Web Council, a U.S. government resource that accumulates information on the matter from all government agencies, confirms:AIDS is the late stage of HIV infection that occurs when the body's immune system is badly damaged because of the virus.The Council adds that in the U.S., prescribed HIV medicine prevents HIV from progressing to AIDS in most cases.A 2010 paper summarized how the scientific community had reached a consensus on the connection between HIV and AIDS by the 1990s:HIV meets several standards of epidemiologic causality. HIV has satisfied Koch's postulates, the traditional standard of infectious disease causation. To satisfy Koch's postulates, one has to isolate the infectious agent from diseased animals, culture it in the lab, inoculate the agent into healthy animals which then develop disease, and reisolate the same infectious agent. The difficulty in fulfilling the postulates was because HIV does not cause disease in animals other than humans and it is unethical to infect healthy persons with HIV just to satisfy Koch's guidelines. However, the postulates were satisfied when the HIV virus was isolated from AIDS patients, cultured in vitro, and upon accidental inoculation into previously uninfected lab workers who subsequently developed AIDS, the exact laboratory HIV clone was re-isolated from the patients. Using a causal model developed for chronic disease, HIV satisfies all of Sir Bradford Hill's guidelines for assessing causality: numerous studies comparing infected and non-infected persons have shown that AIDS develops only in those infected with HIV (very strong association, consistency and specificity); follow-up cohorts have shown that the time relationship is that HIV infection always precedes AIDS (temporality); higher level of virus as measured by viral load correlates with and predicts severity of disease (biological gradient); treatment that suppresses virus leads to clinical improvement (experiment); there is an almost unique pathophysiological mechanism of how HIV leads to AIDS through the loss of CD4 lymphocytes (specificity and plausibility); and numerous studies on HIV-1, HIV-2, SIV, SHIV and other viruses satisfy the coherence and analogy guidelines.Medical disinformation and misinformation on the matter were also proven disastrously deadly. One of the most outstanding examples cited by many scholars (for example, here) is South Africa:In South Africa during Thabo Mbeki's presidency (1999-2008), AIDS denialism was institutionalized at the highest levels of government. This disinformation delayed official recognition of HIV as the etiology of AIDS and the accessibility of life-saving anti-retroviral therapy, which directly contributed to more than 330,000 preventable deaths.During the COVID-19 pandemic, as observed by Lead Stories, many HIV/AIDS claims merged with anti-vaccination narratives.Other Lead Stories fact checks about HIV/AIDS can be found here, here, here and here.",False,"Dec 20, 2022"

He is head of THT Direct, a helpline operated by London-based AIDS charity the Terrence Higgins Trust. Gampenrieder said:We do hear of such unestablished reports from various sources, however we can only rely on proven scientific and clinical research... unfortunately to-date, it has not been possible to develop a functioning cure for HIV. With this in mind we do not encourage people to believe messages on social media [about] natural remedies or treatment that will 'cure' HIV. Only by taking antiretroviral treatment can you control HIV to make it a manageable health condition.Antiretroviral treatment is a daily regimen in which patients take a combination of HIV medicines in hopes of reducing their viral loads to undetectable levels, according to the U.S. National Institutes of Health's website. The therapy ""cannot cure HIV, but HIV medicines help people with HIV live longer, healthier lives,"" the NIH says.Medical investigators have so far come up with no solid evidence to support the efficacy of natural remedies in HIV treatment. A 2005 study headed by Jian-Ping Liu of the Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, which teaches acupuncture and medicinal herb preparation, examined whether eight Chinese herbal treatments could help HIV patients. The researchers concluded:There is insufficient evidence to support the use of herbal medicines in HIV‐infected individuals and AIDS patients. Potential beneficial effects need to be confirmed in large, rigorous trials.Nigerian herbal traditionAn estimated 1.9 million of Nigeria's 211.4 million people are HIV positive, making it the country with the fourth-largest HIV epidemic in the world, according to the CDC.Natural treatments for HIV are available from Nigerian street vendors and village herbalists, according to the University of Liverpool's Joshua Gini, who studied natural medicine use among Nigerian HIV patients for a 2018 paper. Of the 742 HIV-positive people surveyed, 310 said they used plant-based treatments. Of these, 259 used them alongside antiretrovirals and 45 were taking herbs alone.Lead Stories called the Nigerian telephone number listed on the Instagram post and spoke to a man who identified himself as Dr. Otor -- a self-described ""herbalist spell doctor."" He said the Western medical community does not want to acknowledge that his methods can cure HIV because it prefers to profit from chronically ill patients:A cured patient is a lost customer.

He did not elaborate on any specific part of the post.Lead Stories could find no credible evidence that U.S. agencies that make monetary policy or produce U.S. currencies have announced a demonetization plan to strip older dollars of their status as legal tender.Although U.S. currencies are sometimes updated, all Federal Reserve notes -- in other words, U.S. dollars -- dating back as far as 1914 ""remain legal tender, or legally valid for payments,"" according to the U.S. Currency Education Program, which is run by the Federal Reserve Board, in cooperation with the U.S. Secret Service and the U.S. Treasury Department's Bureau of Engraving and Printing.Here's how the U.S. Currency Education Program explains this policy on its website:(Source: U.S. Currency Education Program website screenshot taken Tues Nov 15 at 18:18:47 2022 UTC)Dollar bills, however, do have a ""life expectancy."" Each year, notes that are damaged or no longer meet the Treasury's standards can be taken out of circulation and destroyed. Individual bills with higher denominations -- for example, a $100 bill -- typically are used less frequently and stay in circulation longer than smaller denominations, like $5 and $1 bills, a Federal Reserve chart shows.Countries have opted in the past to demonetize their currencies for many reasons, including to stabilize its value, form currency unions, facilitate trade or address inflation. The Coinage Act of 1873, for example, demonetized silver as the legal tender of the United States after the discovery of large silver deposits in the West. The U.S. eventually adopted the gold standard as a means of thwarting inflation. More recently, in 2000, the French franc, German mark and currencies of other European Union member-states were demonetized to facilitate trade when the European Union adopted the euro.However, demonetization of any currency to remove its legal tender status can disrupt a country's economy because it impacts the medium of exchange used in all economic transactions.The widely shared claim that the U.S., together with non-U.S. actors, plans to demonetize pre-2021 U.S. dollars appears to stem from a story published on November 5, 2022, by the Nigerian news outlet, Observer Times.According to the story, a decision to demonetize older dollars was reached during a November 2, 2022, meeting between the Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of Currency, the World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the governors of African central banks. Without proof, the story further claims that these institutions aim to stop the warehousing of ""billions of illegal monies in dollar bills"" stemming from ""the illegal drug trade, terrorism, kidnapping and other crimes.""Reporting by Lead Stories found no evidence that the reported meeting between the Federal Reserve, Comptroller of Currency, World Bank, IMF and African central bank governors took place. A calendar entry for the Federal Reserve shows that on the date in question, November 2, 2022, it began a two-day quarterly meeting with its Federal Open Market Committee. No meetings with international or African financial institutions appear on the calendar.However, the World Bank, IMF and African central bank governors play no role in determining which U.S. bank notes should be withdrawn from circulation. In 1969, for instance, when four denominations of U.S. dollar bills were withdrawn from circulation, the Federal Reserve and Treasury Department made the announcement, according to the Treasury Department's Bureau of Engraving and Printing.A review of 2022 press releases from both the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department shows that neither has issued any statement about the demonetization of pre-2021 dollar bills, as Observer Times reported.

This is a significant concern among our global fact-checking community.What we do not see is much effort by YouTube to implement policies that address the problem. On the contrary, YouTube is allowing its platform to be weaponized by unscrupulous actors to manipulate and exploit others, and to organize and fundraise themselves. Current measures are proving insufficient. That is why we urge you to take effective action against disinformation and misinformation, and to elaborate a roadmap of policy and product interventions to improve the information ecosystem - and to do so with the world's independent, non-partisan fact-checking organizations.In the last year we have seen conspiracy groups thriving and collaborating across borders, including an international movement that started in Germany, jumped to Spain and spread through Latin America, all on YouTube. Meanwhile, millions of other users were watching videos in Greek and Arabic that encouraged them to boycott vaccinations or treat their COVID-19 infections with bogus cures. Beyond COVID-19, YouTube videos have been promoting false cures for cancer for years.In Brazil, the platform has been used to amplify hate speech against vulnerable groups, reaching tens of thousands of users. Elections are not safe either. In the Philippines, false content with over 2 million views denying human rights abuses and corruption during the Martial law years are being used to burnish the reputation of the late dictator's son, one of the candidates in the 2022 elections. In Taiwan, the last election was marred by unsubstantiated accusations of fraud. The whole world witnessed the consequences of disinformation when a violent mob assaulted the U.S. Capitol last year. From the eve of the U.S. presidential election to the day after, YouTube videos supporting the ""fraud"" narrative were watched more than 33 million times.The examples are too many to count. Many of those videos and channels remain online today, and they all went under the radar of YouTube's policies, especially in non-English speaking countries and the Global South. We are glad that the company has made some moves to try to address this problem lately, but based on what we see daily on the platform, we think these efforts are not working - nor has YouTube produced any quality data to prove their effectiveness.Your company platform has so far framed discussions about disinformation as a false dichotomy of deleting or not deleting content. By doing this, YouTube is avoiding the possibility of doing what has been proven to work: our experience as fact-checkers together with academic evidence tells us that surfacing fact-checked information is more effective than deleting content. It also preserves freedom of expression while acknowledging the need for additional information to mitigate the risks of harm to life, health, safety and democratic processes. And given that a large proportion of views on YouTube come from its own recommendation algorithm, YouTube should also make sure it does not actively promote disinformation to its users or recommend content coming from unreliable channels.With all this in mind, we propose some solutions that would make a great deal of difference in reducing the dissemination of disinformation and misinformation on YouTube.A commitment to meaningful transparency about disinformation on the platform: YouTube should support independent research about the origins of the different misinformation campaigns, their reach and impact, and the most effective ways to debunk false information. It should also publish its full moderation policy regarding disinformation and misinformation, including the use of artificial intelligence and which data powers it.Beyond removing content for legal compliance, YouTube's focus should be on providing context and offering debunks, clearly superimposed on videos or as additional video content. That only can come from entering into a meaningful and structured collaboration taking the responsibility and systematically investing in independent fact-checking efforts around the world that are working to solve these issues.Acting against repeat offenders that produce content that is constantly flagged as disinformation and misinformation, particularly those monetizing that content on and outside the platform, notably by preventing its recommendation algorithms from promoting content from such sources of misinformation.Extend current and future efforts against disinformation and misinformation in languages different from English, and providing country- and language-specific data, as well as transcription services that work in any language.We hope you will consider implementing these ideas for the public good and to make YouTube a platform that truly does its best to prevent disinformation and misinformation being weaponized against its users and society at large. We are ready and able to help YouTube. We wish to meet with you to discuss these matters and find ways forward on a collaboration and look forward to your response to this offer.Africa Check (Senegal, Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa) / Animal Político - El Sabueso (Mexico) / Aos Fatos (Brazil) / Bolivia Verifica (Bolivia) / BOOM (India, Myanmar and Bangladesh) / Check Your Fact (USA) / Code for Africa - PesaCheck (Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Côte d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea, Kenya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria Senegal, South Africa, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda and Zimbabwe) / Colombiacheck (Colombia) / CORRECTIV (Germany) / Cotejo.info (Venezuela) / Chequeado (Argentina) / Delfi Lithuania (Lithuania) / Demagog Association (Poland) / Doğruluk Payı (Turkey) / Dubawa (Nigeria, Ghana, Sierra Leone, Liberia and The Gambia) / Ecuador Chequea (Ecuador) / Ellinika Hoaxes (Greece) / Fact Crescendo (India) / Fact-Check Ghana / FactCheck.org (USA) / FactSpace West Africa / Facta (Italy) / FactcheckNI (UK) / Factly (India) / Factual.ro (Romania) /FactWatch (Bangladesh) / Fakenews.pl (Poland) / Faktist.no (Norway) / Faktograf.hr (Croatia) / Faktoje (Albania) / Fast Check CL (Chile) / Fatabyyano (Middle East and North Africa) / Full Fact (UK) / GRASS - FactCheck Georgia / India Today Group (India) / Istinomer (Serbia) / Istinomjer (Bosnia i Herzegovina) / Hibrid.info (Kosovo) / Knack Magazine (Belgium) / La Silla Vacía (Colombia) / Lead Stories (USA) / Les Surligneurs (France) / Logically (UK) / Lupa (Brazil) / Maldita.es (Spain) / MediaWise (USA) / Mongolian Fact-checking Center (Mongolia) / MyGoPen (Taiwan) / Myth Detector (Georgia) / NewsMobile (India) / Newschecker (India and South Asia) / Newtral (Spain) / Observador - Fact Check (Portugal) / Open Fact-checking (Italy) / OŠTRO (Slovenia) / Pagella Politica (Italy) Poligrafo (Portugal) / PolitiFact (USA) / Pravda (Poland) / Rappler (Philippines) / Raskrinkavanje (Bosnia i Herzegovina) / Re:Check/Re:Baltica (Latvia) / RMIT ABC Fact Check (Australia) Rumor Scanner (Bangladesh) / Science Feedback (France) / StopFake (Ukraine) / Stopfals.md (Moldova) / Taiwan FactCheck Center (Taiwan) / Tempo (Indonesia) / Teyit (Turkey) / The Healthy Indian Project/THIP Media (India) / The Journal FactCheck (Ireland) / The Logical Indian (India) / The Quint (India) / The Washington Post Fact-checker (USA) / The Whistle (Israel) / TjekDet (Denmark) / Univision - elDetector (USA) / VERA Files (Philippines) / Verificat (Spain) / Vishvas News (India) / Vistinomer (North Macedonia) / VoxCheck (Ukraine) / Youturn.in (India) / 15min (Lithuania)",False,"Jan 12, 2022"

"A word from Jerry's parents

No, that's not true: Many suspicious fundraising posts on Facebook contain uncanny similarities -- similar stories, similar photos and similar bank accounts. There is no evidence that these fundraising campaigns are going to help people in need.Lead Stories found posts that fit this deceptive formula dating to July 2021, but the story about Jerry Stephen was introduced in early December. One example is a post published to the Facebook group korra obidi fan page on December 8, 2021. Included with the post are five photos. Two show a man in a hospital bed; three show car accidents that do not appear to be the same vehicles or same accident scene.

IVERMECTIN REDUCESMALE FERTILITY.
HAPPY FRIDAY, EVERYONE!OCCUPY DEMOCRATS","Does a Nigerian study done in 2011 show that men who took ivermectin as a treatment for onchocerciasis, or river blindness, were made sterile by the anti-parasitic drug? No, that's not true: The study, which only included 37 patients and no control group, did not conclude that the participants had been rendered sterile, but noted changes to sperm count and motility 11 months after treatment. The 85% figure this study quotes came from a 2002 report that two of the authors purportedly published.The mention of the 2002 report does not say the ivermectin treatment caused infertility, but that patients treated in the recent past with ivermectin at the clinic who returned for other routine tests exhibited varying types and degrees of dysfunction in sperm count, motility and morphology.Claims on social media around September 4, 2021, pointed to a .pdf file of a 2011 Nigerian study. One example is a post by the Facebook page Union Thugs on September 5, 2021, with the caption, ""When the sheep spay and neuter themselves."" The text inside the image reads:NEED SOME GOOD NEWS?People also ask :Does ivermectin cause low sperm count?The above parameters were measured before and after the patients were treated with 150ug/kg body wt of ivermectin for eleven months and the results were compared and also with normal control reference range. We observed significant reduction in the sperm counts and sperm motility of the patients testedhttps://www.scholarsresearchlibrary.com > articles PDFIVERMECTIN REDUCESMALE FERTILITY.HAPPY FRIDAY, EVERYONE!OCCUPY DEMOCRATSThis is what the post looked like on Facebook at the time of writing:     (Source: Facebook screenshot taken on Fri Sep 10 17:05:31 2021 UTC)The 2011 Nigerian study began with a group of 385 onchocerciasis patients. Only 37 of these patients were found to be suitable candidates for the study. This is a very small sample size and there was no control group to compare doing nothing with the impacts of taking the drug. Nine out of 10 of the original 385 patients were ruled out due to low sperm counts -- before the ivermectin treatment even started. This raises many questions. The conclusion of the 2011 study is that there is a need for caution and further research.The introduction mentions a ""recent report"" where 85% percent of male patients at a specific treatment center were found to have varying degrees of sperm dysfunctions. This phrasing does not go so far as to say the men were sterile or infertile.Chijioke and Ononkwo [5] observed that ivermectin is a safe and well-tolerated drug and that the incidence, but not the severity of adverse effects attributed to ivermectin therapy is related to the pre-treatment intensity of microfilariae in the skin.However, a recent report showed that 85% of all male patients treated in a particular centre with ivermectin in the recent past who went to the laboratory for routine tests were discovered to have developed various forms, grades and degrees of sperm dysfunctions including, low sperm counts, poor sperm morphologies (two heads, Tiny heads Double tails absence of tail's, Albino sperm calls), azoospermia and poor sperm motility [6]. Several studies done on animals also showed similar findings [7, 8]. However, study on human on the effect of ivermectin therapy on male fertility is scanty. It is therefore the aim of this study to investigate the effect of ivermectin on the sperm functions of onchocerciasis patients.The footnote for this ""recent"" report, ""[6] Asika E.C. Okhiai O. Awemu G.A . Journal of Biomedical investigation; 2002: 3(1) 41-43,"" includes the names of two of the authors of the 2011 study, Asika E.C. and Okhiai O. The report is also not very recent; in 2011 it would already have been 9 years old. Lead Stories was unable to retrieve the referenced 2002 report, whose title is not noted, from the Journal of Biomedical Investigation. Curiously, it appears that the first volume of that journal was published in 2003, one year after the cited article was said to be published. Lead Stories reached out by email to African Journals Online and will update if the report is found and has any information relevant to this question.The FDA has an information sheet for the ivermectin drug used to treat onchocerciasis, manufactured by Merck Sharp & Dohme BV, which goes by the brand name Stromectol. This sheet contains warnings about potential side effects from both the Mazzotti reaction (a reaction to the die-off of the parasites) and to the drug itself. As for the specific question of male fertility it says:Ivermectin had no adverse effects on the fertility in rats in studies at repeated doses of up to 3 times the maximum recommended human dose of 200 mcg/kg (on a mg/m2/day basis).The information sheet says that ""Ivermectin should not be used during pregnancy since safety in pregnancy has not been established.""Ivermectin has been shown to be teratogenic in mice, rats, and rabbits when given in repeated doses of 0.2, 8.1, and 4.5 times the maximum recommended human dose, respectively (on a mg/m2/day basis).Teratogenicity was characterized in the three species tested by cleft palate; clubbed forepaws were additionally observed in rabbits. These developmental effects were found only at or near doses that were maternotoxic to the pregnant female. Therefore, ivermectin does not appear to be selectively fetotoxic to the developing fetus.There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Ivermectin should not be used during pregnancy since safety in pregnancy has not been established.The FDA has published a fact sheet titled, ""Why You Should Not Use Ivermectin to Treat or Prevent COVID-19""Below is a collection of memes and screenshots found on Facebook on September 10, 2021, that repeat the unsupported claim that ivermectin sterilizes the majority (85%) of men who take it.

It discusses three options for a new marriage policy, one of which includes the possibility of allowing women who are citizens of South Africa to marry multiple men, a practice known as polyandry. Polygyny -- one man marrying multiple women -- is a traditional practice that is recognized by customary law in South Africa.The original version of the video featured in the Facebook post is from the Instagram account of Nigerian actress Moyo Lawal.

According to him, it was while he and others were fiddling with it that it exploded.A video posted to the YouTube channel of TVC News Nigeria on May 27, 2019 includes an interview with Rivers State Police Command spokesperson, Nnamdi Omoni who explained that the incident was not related to terrorism or cultism. The tear gas had been police-issued equipment of a deceased police officer who was the uncle of the student. There was a police investigation into how the 17-year-old student came to possess the tear gas canister and internal investigation why this item had not been collected after the officer's death as the department would usually do any time an officer is dismissed or deceased.Currently there is no Covid-19 Vaccine being administered in Nigeria, but the National Primary Healthcare Development Agency will have updates as the vaccines are ready to be distributed.Q: Is the #COVID19 vaccine in Nigeria?A: Not yet. @NigeriaGov through @NphcdaNG is leading Nigeria's efforts to access safe and effective vaccines.Visit https://t.co/Zd6gvypc32 for more information on vaccines.For more FAQs:https://t.co/y7LzA4AE6r#TakeResponsibility pic.twitter.com/QfQME1onHV-- NCDC (@NCDCgov) February 8, 2021",False,"Feb  8, 2021"

WhatsApp, because of its encrypted design, cannot even trace the number of times a picture has been shared. This post does not follow Facebook's monetization promotion guidelines. This post presents a false scenario that encourages a social media user to share. There could be several hidden motivations for that, but none of them have to do with medical care for a blind baby.The false claim reappeared on Facebook as a post (archived here) published on November 16, 2019.

Please share.This is what the post looked like on Facebook at the time of writing:     (Source: Facebook screenshot taken on Tue Nov 10 16:22:45 2020 UTC)Although this post is almost a year old, it resurfaced in November of 2020 and has been getting renewed attention. This post appears to be part of a series of ""blind baby"" posts published on Facebook starting in early 2017. The earliest edition of this specific photo on Facebook that Lead Stories could locate was a November 27, 2017, post, but the caption text is identical to the other English-language posts of the ""blind baby"" series that appeared much earlier in the year.Below are some examples of 2017 posts each using a different photo and the same share-baiting caption. Even the misspelling: ""wasapp,"" appears in almost all of the duplicate posts. These pictures and the false claims have circulated all over the world, in several languages and on several social media platforms. There is no evidence that Facebook donates money according to how many times a picture is shared.The baby with the yellow cap in the February 2, 2017, Facebook post was featured by Austrian Fact Checker Mimikama.at in a February 10, 2017, article titled, ""WhatsApp-Nachricht mit: Dieses Baby ist blind."" From the record of this article we can know that the posts were introduced to WhatsApp in that same time frame, and at least one edition was circulating with a caption in German falsely claiming that WhatsApp would pay for the baby's medical care according to the number of shares:""Dieses Bild unbedingt weiterschicken! Dieses Baby ist blind. WhatsApp zählt wie oft es geteilt wurde und bezahlt dann die Operation!"" This photo had already appeared in a January 30, 2017 post in the Bosnian language with a slightly different phrasing in the deceptive caption:Only people without heart and love will ignore this !!!If you would help this girl, like and share the post !!!This little girl can't open her eyes, this is how she was born.LET'S SEE HOW MANY OF US WOULD HAVE HER TO SEE ??? !!!God help her AMEN!One post from June 15, 2017, showing a woman with eyeglasses, was shared by a person posting from Ikorodu, Nigeria. That post also was shared with a Thai language caption. This particular post has also been the subject of some debunking. On November 27, 2018, Hoax-Slayer.net published an article, ""WhatsApp Blind Baby Donation Hoax Still Circulating.""

Of all the blind baby meme photos, this one is the only one for which Lead Stories could locate the original story. It is a tragic story from India that has nothing to do with a baby being born blind. This baby's mother, Shruthi Suvarna, died in childbirth on June 7, 2016. Daijiworld.com wrote on June 18, 2016, ""Udupi: 24-year-old woman dies during delivery, medical negligence alleged."" A June 12, 2016, Facebook post shows a collection of photos of Shruthi Suvarna, including the photo taken to make the false blind baby meme.Share-baiting is a well-established engagement tactic on Facebook that goes hand-in-hand with like-baiting and comment-baiting. In this case of the ""blind baby"" memes, no clear motivation is evident, especially when factoring WhatsApp in how this meme spread. WhatsApp does not have a means of liking posts or counting them so this mysterious deception seems rather pointless. These posts about the babies were never true, but is it possible that such a promotion could happen?Lead Stories reached out to Facebook's Communications office to inquire about this type of post. We were directed to the monetization promotion guidelines. In the portion covering administration of promotions, section two states:Required Content: Promotions must include the following:A complete release of Facebook by each entrant or participant; andAcknowledgement that the Promotion is in no way sponsored, endorsed, administered by or associated with Facebook.This policy makes it clear that promotions from publishers on Facebook should never be associating their promotion with Facebook.Tricking an audience to interact with a post on Facebook will cause the post to become more visible algorithmically. Sharing the post to a group or to one's friend circle will give that post an even larger audience. The motivation behind some share-baiting is easy to trace. For example, a fake giveaway directs a person to share the post and like the page to be entered to win. The giveaway is a ruse (there is no prize) to get people to like the new page, increasing its value. After tens of thousands of real people have liked the page, the page might be sold or change its name. Another share-bait tactic is to increase exposure for an influencer or page plays into a marketing strategy.Sometimes share-baiting is used to disseminate a post. After the post has been shared, the original post is edited to become something else: a bait-and-switch.",False,"Dec  3, 2020"
Obama stole the money and gave it away. We would like to know how much kick back did he get?,"Were the two terms that Barack Obama spent in office ""a crime spree"" in which $4 trillion of $6 trillion sent to Muslim nations disappeared, $200 billion was sent to Iran, $500 billion was ""stolen"" from the Housing and Urban Development department, and $50 billion was set aside to build mosques around the globe? No, that's not true. The claims are untrue, overstated, or skew facts publicly available in reports and documents and no law enforcement authority has even brought charges.The claims appear in a post (archived here) published March 3, 2019, on the Deplorables for Trump Facebook page. The opening lines of the post, which is chiefly a meme titled ""This was not a presidential administration...It was a crime spree,"" are:Obama stole the money and gave it away. We would like to know how much kick back did he get?This is what the post looked like on Facebook at the time of writing:There are several claims in the meme -- none of them attributed or sourced to back them up.First, was '$6 trillion sent to Muslim nation ...$4 Trillion just disappears'?This claim has no backing, and Lead Stories was unable to find any documentation that Obama sent $6 trillion to a Muslim nation or nations, let alone saw $4 trillion of that disappearing. If the post was based on President Trump's claim that we've spent that amount on Middle East wars, the calculation is still wrong. For one thing, those wars started long before Obama took office. Trump's words in October 2016, ahead of his election, were:The people opposing us are the same people -- and think of this -- who've wasted $6 trillion on wars in the Middle East -- we could have rebuilt our country twice -- that have produced only more terrorism, more death, and more suffering. Imagine if that money had been spent at home.""Here's a YouTube video of the comments:Here are the correct estimates from December 2014, according to the Congressional Research Office (This accounts for Iraq, Afghanistan, and all terror operations since 9/11:With enactment of the FY2014 Consolidated Appropriations Act on January 1, 2014 (H.R. 3547/P.L. 113-73), Congress has approved appropriations for the past 13 years of war that total $1.6 trillion for military operations, base support, weapons maintenance, training of Afghan and Iraq security forces, reconstruction, foreign aid, embassy costs, and veterans' health care for the war operations initiated since the 9/11 attacks.""Lead Stories is not clear where the posters came up with the remaining $4 trillion-plus figure -- or how it was determined that the Obama administration lost $4 trillion of $6 trillion. Trump, however, repeated the claim in February 2017, just a month into his presidency, according to this video clip of him with airline executives.Trump said again today we should have kept the oil in Middle East. As @mitchellreports has pointed out--that's illegal, could be a war crime. pic.twitter.com/FbWAUItCKr-- Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) February 9, 2017Was $200 billion sent to Iran under Obama?If this is referring to the U.S. transferring money to Iran -- something that led to charges that the White House paid Tehran a ransom -- the numbers are again wrong. According to a Wall Street Journal story from August 3, 2016:The Obama administration secretly organized an airlift of $400 million worth of cash to Iran that coincided with the January release of four Americans detained in Tehran, according to U.S. and European officials and congressional staff briefed on the operation afterward.Wooden pallets stacked with euros, Swiss francs and other currencies were flown into Iran on an unmarked cargo plane, according to these officials. The U.S. procured the money from the central banks of the Netherlands and Switzerland, they said.The money represented the first installment of a $1.7 billion settlement the Obama administration reached with Iran to resolve a decades-old dispute over a failed arms deal signed just before the 1979 fall of Iran's last monarch, Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.""Yet again, with no sourcing in the meme, it is difficult to say where the posters got their figures.According to a later story from CNN on June 21, 2019,Trump wrote that through the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with Iran, Obama 'gave (Iran) 150 Billion Dollars.'Facts First: The Iran Deal unlocked Iranian assets that were previously frozen due to sanctions, but it's unclear how much those assets were worth -- $150 billion is the highest estimate provided by US officials and it's thought that Iran could not have accessed all of that money because much of it was tied up in projects overseas.Trump's assertion that Obama ""gave"" Iran this money is not quite accurate. As part of the deal (which multiple countries were involved in), Iranian assets held in banks and financial institutions across the world were unfrozen.Estimates for the value of these assets vary. In an op-ed in 2015, then-Michigan Republican Rep. Dave Trott, said sanction relief would add up to somewhere between $50 billion and $150 billion.At the time, the US Treasury Department estimated that the usable liquid assets Iran would be able to access would equal 'a little more than $50 billion,' Adam Szubin, then acting undersecretary of treasury, said during a 2015 hearing to the Senate Banking Committee.""Here is part of the statement from the U.S. Department of the Treasury on the funds:The Impact of Our Sanctions: Bringing Iran to the TableThe powerful set of U.S. and international sanctions on Iran, and especially those imposed over the last five years, effectively isolated Iran from the world economy. The U.S. government led this effort across two administrations and with bipartisan backing in Congress. Together we obtained four tough UN Security Council resolutions, and built upon our longstanding primary embargo by enlisting the support of foreign partners from Europe to Asia to impose further pressure on Iran. This campaign yielded results. After years of intransigence, Iran came to the table prepared to negotiate seriously over its nuclear program.To see the impact of the sanctions campaign, consider the following metrics. Today, the Iranian economy is estimated to be only 80 percent the size that it would have been, had it continued on its pre-2012 growth path. Consequently, it will take until at least 2022--even with sanctions relief--for Iran to get back to where it would have been absent our sanctions. Iran has foregone approximately $160 billion in oil revenue alone since 2012, after our sanctions reduced Iran's oil exports by 60 percent. This money is lost and cannot be recovered.Iran's designated banks, as well as its Central Bank, have been cut off from the world. The Iranian currency has declined by more than 50 percent. We maintained strong economic pressure throughout the two-year negotiating period. Indeed, during that time, our sanctions deprived Iran of an additional $70 billion in oil revenue, and Iran's total trade with the rest of the world remained virtually flat.To achieve this pressure, international consensus and cooperation were vital. Around the world, views on Iran's sponsorship of groups like Hizballah and its regional interventions differ. But the world's major powers have been united in preventing a nuclear-armed Iran. Iran's major trading partners and oil customers joined us in imposing pressure on Iran, and paid a significant economic price to do so, based on U.S. sanctions and a clear path forward. The point of these efforts was clear: to change Iran's nuclear behavior, while holding out the prospect of relief if Iran addressed the world's concerns about its nuclear program.""Was $500 billion 'stolen' from HUD?The short answer is no, accounting errors were discovered, and there is zero proof that Obama was directly involved in them. Yet, current HUD Secretary Ben Carson has been credited with discovering the ""theft."" The Office of the Inspector General issued this updated report after Carson got into office. At that time, the OIG's updated audit found:What We Audited and WhyIn accordance with the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990, as amended, we are required to annually audit the consolidated financial statements of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). HUD reissued its fiscal years 2016 and 2015 (restated) consolidated financial statements due to pervasive material errors that we identified. Our objective was to express an opinion on the fairness of HUD's consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) applicable to the Federal Government. This report presents our reissued independent auditor's report on HUD's fiscal years 2016 and 2015 (restated) consolidated financial statements, including an update to our report on HUD's internal controls.What We FoundThe total amounts of errors corrected in HUD's notes and consolidated financial statements were $516.4 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively. There were several other unresolved audit matters, which restricted our ability to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to express an opinion. These unresolved audit matters relate to (1) the Office of General Counsel's refusal to sign the management representation letter, (2) HUD's improper use of cumulative and first-in, first-out budgetary accounting methods of disbursing community planning and development program funds, (3) the $4.2 billion in nonpooled loan assets from Ginnie Mae's stand-alone financial statements that we could not audit due to inadequate support, (4) the improper accounting for certain HUD assets and liabilities, and (5) material differences between HUD's subledger and general ledger accounts. This audit report contains 11 material weaknesses, 7 significant deficiencies, and 5 instances of noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations.FactCheck.org found a memo, no longer available, from HUD Deputy Chief Financial Officer Courtney Timberlake that stated:Overall, the combined adjustments to the consolidated financial statements resulted in a net adjustment of $3 million, but no change in HUD's financial position or impact on our programs.""The March 1, 2017, OIG report took issue with HUD's statement:HUD states that the ""presentation of the financial information was inaccurate"" and describes the errors in its financial statements and notes as ""inconsistencies."" Since the financial information reported was not correct, these statements are misleading because they imply that the information reported was correct but was merely presented inconsistently. Further, HUD states, ""Overall, the combined adjustments to the consolidated financial statements resulted in a net adjustment of $3 million, but no changes in HUD's financial position or impact to our programs."" HUD management is downplaying the severity of the condition and impact of the errors identified, which were significant enough to cause it to recall its published AFR and reissue its fiscal year 2016 consolidated financial statements and notes. While the errors identified may not have changed HUD's financial position, as HUD states at the bottom of its financial statements, ""The accompanying notes are an integral part of these statements."" These notes contained errors of $516.4 billion. While we have audited HUD's reissued statements, we have not fully evaluated any of the new process improvements HUD discussed in its response. We look forward to evaluating these processes as part of our fiscal year 2017 audit.So yes, there were accounting errors, but auditors did not find that Obama ""stole"" the money.Did Obama spend $50 to build mosques around the world?This claim dates to 2010, according to FactCheck.org, which reported that the American Family Foundation sent out a ""mass e-mail"" making the claim. That email is no longer available at the AFA's website, but its contents were printed in the FactCheck.org report:Obama gives your tax dollars to rebuild Muslim mosques around the world. While millions of Americans struggle to keep their homes and jobs, President Barack Obama can't give your tax dollars away fast enough. [EET ]August 26, 2010Dear XXXX,US taxpayer dollars are being given away to help rebuild Islamic mosques overseas. According to the Associated Press, the Obama administration will give away nearly $6 million of American tax dollars to restore 63 historic and cultural sites, including Islamic mosques and minarets, in 55 nations. See the State Department document here.This is an outrage! Our country is broke. And can you imagine what the ACLU and others on the secular left would say if these monies had been spent to repair Christian churches? They would be screaming ""separation of church and state!"" Funding Islam on foreign soil with American taxpayer money? Not a whimper.The latest taxpayer giveaway includes $76,000 for a 16thcentury mosque in China, $67,000 for a mosque in Pakistan,$77,000 to restore minarets in Nigeria and Mauritania, and$50,000 for an Islamic Monument in India.Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton says the U.S. program to restore Islamic and other cultural sites in other countries is taxpayer money well spent.Take ActionContact your member of Congress today!In fact, according to FactCheck.org's report, the money was given to cultural sites of historical significance, including churches. Moreover:...the program isn't the brainchild of President Barack Obama. The program was created by Congress in late 2000 under President Bill Clinton, and the first grants were announced under President George W. Bush in 2001. The State Department says that, in total, the fund has contributed nearly $26 million to approximately 640 cultural heritage sites in more than 100 countries, and more than half was given before Obama took office.Every link in the FactCheck.org story has since been taken down.",False,"Oct 20, 2020"

However, even within counties this can vary widely between males and females and in cases of heterosexual and homosexual sex.In the UK, the age of consent stands at 16, regardless of gender or sexual orientation.The country with the lowest age of consent is Nigeria, where it is set at 11, according to this study:The age of consent in Nigeria (the minimum age at which an individual is considered legally old enough to consent to participation in sexual activity) is 11 years old.While there are no current efforts to lower the age of consent, the claim that a group wanted it to be reduced to 4 may be rooted in the reported formation of a British group in the 1970s known as Paedophile Information Exchange, or PIE. The BBC reported that PIE existed for a decade:PIE was formed in 1974. It campaigned for ""children's sexuality"". It wanted the government to axe or lower the age of consent. It offered support to adults ""in legal difficulties concerning sexual acts with consenting 'under age' partners"". The real aim was to normalise sex with children.Britain's Mirror newspaper reported in a 2013 article titled After 30 years without an answer it's time to find out who protected the infamous Paedophile Information Exchange:PIE was established in 1974 to campaign for the age of consent to be lowered to four years old.Many former members have been imprisoned for child abuse crimes.People long dead like Peter Righton, who fooled the social work establishment that he cared for the safety of children, when all the time he was grooming kids for his own despicable ends.PIE included many establishment figures like the highly qualified Dr Morris Fraser, who by day practiced as a child psychiatrist in Belfast but by night, was accused of preying on young vulnerable children.PIE disappeared in the mid-1980s, but another organization formed in the United States in 1978 still survives. The North American Man/Boy Love Association (NAMBLA) state's its goal is ""to end the extreme oppression of men and boys in mutually consensual relationship."" A 2016 Vice.com article titled Whatever Happened to NAMBLA? suggests the end may be near for that organization:NAMBLA, once a visible advocate of pedophilia, doesn't feature heavily into what I call the online pedo-sphere these days. Membership numbers and group activities are difficult to pin down, but based on online research and conversations with alleged former members as well as opponents of the group, both appear to have dwindled to nearly nothing.There is no indication on the NAMBLA website or anywhere that it is waging a campaign to lower the age of consent to 4.",False,"Sep 21, 2020"

TMZ reported about it (here)(archived here) in an October 18, 2011, article titled, ""Soulja BoyYouuuuuuuuuu Got Arrested."" CNN did report about Soulja Boy's arrest as well, in an article (here)(archived here) titled, ""Soulja Boy busted for pot, gun charges,"" but the real CNN article does not match the fictional meme headline about the Nigerian Man. The real CNN and TMZ articles from 2011 are shown below, as well as two versions of the meme inspired by these photos. An earlier version of the meme does identify Soulja Boy. In February 2020, an in-depth investigation from Senior Writer Alex Kasprak of Snopes was published with an intriguing headline: ""Savage Memes and Lunar Dreams: Deceptive Dating Sites' Intimate Ties to Firefly Aerospace."" with the subheading, ""How Cheech and Chong's Facebook timeline unwittingly exposed a network of niche dating websites tied to a Silicon Valley space tycoon."" (here)(archived here) This investigation had spanned over two years' time and Kasprak introduced the complex story this way:In April 2018, a seemingly simple question first presented itself to us: Why would the official Cheech and Chong Facebook page be sharing memes that not-so-subtly advertised bogus hook-up sites such as plentyofhoes.com? Our search for that answer took us on a months-long digital odyssey -- first to a small operation run by two men in the English countryside, and ultimately to a much bigger operation spread between Ukraine and Silicon Valley. The convoluted international trail we followed, several financial-crime experts and investigators told us, appears to be designed to obscure the ownership details of companies that profit from deceptive dating websites by using fake profiles and expensive, hard-to-cancel subscription packages.One of the ground-level steps in this scheme was to entice people to go to the dating websites for them to be roped into a hard-to-cancel subscription. This audience was introduced to the names of the dating sites, which belonged to a network called ""Top Offers,"" through ads disguised as memes. These ""memevertisements,"" as Snopes called them, appeared posted by verified accounts, such as Cheech and Chong's, with very large followings. An affiliate marketing platform was associated with the Top Offers dating sites -- and marketers were paid when dating site subscriptions resulted from a variety of their spamming tactics.Meet2party and Fish4nudes appears to be a resurgence of the TopOffers network described in the investigation by Snopes' Alex Kasprak using the same memevertisement tactic to reach a wide audience. He described the ""Savage Squad"" this way:The people who created these ""memevertisements,"" as we call them, are two self-described British ""entrepreneurs"" named Ryan Hodge and Adam Spencer. Both have occasionally referred to themselves as the ""Savage Squad"" (or ""Savage Fam"") on social media. The websites their memes promote are fake sign-up pages programmed to dump a curious Facebook user onto a different, ostensibly legitimate dating website. Thanks to that fake page, the Savage Squad gets credit for bringing the user to that final site. If that user gives up a credit card number, the Squad receives a cut of the profits.Lead Stories found both a Facebook page named Savagehub sharing Fish4nudes memes. Many of the memes have the word savage in them. There are some large verified pages posting the memevertisements. The verified page of the recording artist Waka Flocka Flame with 9,996,115 followers has a unashamed spam balance of about 50% of the posts on the page mentioning either Fish4nudes.com or Meet2party.com.

I don't know how others here feel, l but I'm not willing to take an experimental DNA-alternating vaccine that has been fast-tracked past even the most minimal, or no, safety qualifications to which routine vaccines appear. Because Iknow that health, true health, comes from sunshine, exercise, fresh food, social contact and breathing in as much oxygen as I possibly can -- not from needles or masks.""Click below to watch the video on YouTube:The woman speaking at the public forum identified herself as Emily Coleman, of Olathe, Kansas. Her full testimony, which was cheered by the audience, lasted about 1:20, is found in this Facebook post on the page of 21st Century Wire, whose mission statement on their About Page reads:21st Century delivers news and exposés on intelligence, foreign policy, climate change, the war on terror, technology and Wall Street. Besides demonstrating freedom speech and thought, one of the main intentions of 21st Century Wire is to empower readers by giving them the tools to decode mainstream propaganda.""Here is the Facebook video:In it, Coleman makes several misleading claims. Some vaccines, called DNA vaccines, can be injected into a person to change DNA to target, or ward off, a particular illness or disease. But there is no vaccine at all that is fully approved for use against the coronavirus currently. And while many are in trial phases, showing they are getting tested, there is no proof that whatever vaccine is approved for use -- if any -- would change the human genome. There are, however, concerns that President Trump's Operation Warp Speed may compromise the safety of any vaccine that makes it through sped-up trials, according to this July 13 report. Scientific American addressed the issue in this June 22 report.Also, Coleman suggests that because masks were not mandatory at one point, and now they are in some places, the same would hold true for vaccines. This has never been the case.At 00:38, Coleman says:What about the microchip that comes after the vaccine? It will be voluntary until it's not.""There is no evidence that those potential vaccines undergoing trials currently would include microchips. That is among claims debunked in a recent Lead Stories article: Fact Check: 'The Most Important Video You'll Ever Watch' Is A Rehash of Misleading Coronavirus Claims.And none would include a microchip that would track people. There is nothing to support the claim, mostly surrounding Bill Gates, which he has denied, that any organization or person or the government is looking to implant people with such microchips.Also in the video, which is strongly anti-vaccine, is Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. -- one of the best-known anti-vaccination proponents -- talking against them in an interview. The video then switches to Dr. Carrie Madej, who gives advice about vaccines in general but also makes scary and unproven claims about ""the vaccine,"" that's coming, even though there is no ""the vaccine."" Lead Stories has debunked her claims: Fact Check: Video 'Urgent Information On Covid Vaccine' By Dr. Carrie Madej Is NOT All Science-Based Or Factual.At 28:23, the male host says:You know that this mask, no matter how protective it is, it can kill...Don't overuse it because overuse, it can kill. Because I've seen certain videos of children dying in school during sports, during sports, and with masks on. And I've seen joggers, people that are jogging...The mask on, they collapse and the person died.""While possible -- two schoolchildren wearing masks reportedly died in gym class in China -- there are far more instances of people dying of COVID-19 because they refused to wear a mask. Lead Stories has debunked this claim that oxygen levels are dangerously reduced by masks. The BBC's Reality Check did this story debunking the ""deadly masks"" claims. For more information, read Lead Stories piece, entitled Fact Check: Test Does NOT Show Face Masks Cause Oxygen Levels To Drop Into The 'Danger Zone.'Also, the American Lung Association as early as June 18 (and updated August 6), tried to quell fears being spread online regarding masks. Answering the question ""Do Masks Cause Low Oxygen Levels?"" the association wrote:Absolutely not. We wear masks all day long in the hospital. The masks are designed to be breathed through and there is no evidence that low oxygen levels occur. There is some evidence, however, that prolonged use of N-95 masks in patients with preexisting lung disease could cause some build-up of carbon dioxide levels in the body. People with preexisting lung problems should discuss mask wearing concerns with their health care providers. There is absolutely no scientific evidence that mask wearing or physical distancing weakens the immune system.""Stanford University scientists also addressed this concern.So who are the hosts in the video? Their YouTube About Page says the hosts are located in Nigeria. They describe themselves as:... just a set of fun loving couple with interest in livestyle vlogs, travels, trending matters and religion.""Lead Stories has tried to contact the creators of the YouTube video, and we will update this story if they respond.",False,"Aug  7, 2020"

"The opposition political parties rejected the ""foreign-sponsored Bill"" mandating the compulsory vaccination of all Nigerians even when the vaccines have not been discovered and demanded the Speaker be impeached if he forces the bill on members. The development comes a month after Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the nephew of former American President John F. Kennedy, in a lengthy piece exposed Bill Gates agenda in India and his ""obsession with vaccines""","Did Bill Gates give a $10 billion bribe to the Nigerian government to impose forced vaccinations on its citizens? No, that's not true. There is no evidence of such a huge payment offered beyond an unsupported accusation by a political opposition leader. While the claim implies the forced vaccination would be for COVID-19, no such vaccine was available at the time of writing. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation did fund a grant of $685,714 in Nigeria during 2020 and it would not be unexpected for more money to be donated, but a grant is not the same as a bribe. And there is no expectation that Gates would send nearly 10 percent of his net wealth to one African country.The claim appeared as a caption to a video posted by Viable Tv on Youtube on June 23, 2020. It reads, ""EXPOSED!!! Bill Gates Offered $10 billion Bribe For Forced Vaccination In Africa"" (archived here). The video description reads:The opposition political parties rejected the ""foreign-sponsored Bill"" mandating the compulsory vaccination of all Nigerians even when the vaccines have not been discovered and demanded the Speaker be impeached if he forces the bill on members. The development comes a month after Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the nephew of former American President John F. Kennedy, in a lengthy piece exposed Bill Gates agenda in India and his ""obsession with vaccines""Click below to watch the video on YouTube:The video began with the words of Coalition of United Political Parties (CUPP) spokesman Ikenga Ugochinyere saying he objects to having been arrested and stands by his charge that Nigeria's House of Representatives Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila took a bribe to push through the ""Control of Infectious Diseases Bill.""The two had been trading accusations of misconduct, the chief allegation being that the speaker was bribed with $10 million -- not $10 billion -- by Bill Gates to ""speed approval of the Infectious Diseases Bill."" The legislation does not include a provison for forcibly vaccinating Nigerians.The speaker called for Ugochinyere's arrest. Subsequently, federal judge, Othman Musa, ruled that Ugochinyere must not be arrested and ordered security agents not to obey the resolution of the House to arrest him. But according to Sahara Reports the Nigeria Police Force arrested him anyway and Gbajabiamila set up a 12-man committee to look into allegations that ""himself and some members of the House collected a $10 million bribe from a foreign sponsor"" Gbajabiamila made the announcement during a plenary session on May 4, 2020.According to Gates Foundation records, a grant of $685,714 has been awarded in 2020 to Nigeria ""to strengthen public health emergency preparedness and response in Nigeria in the context of the novel coronavirus.""The caption under the video is misleading. Ugochinyere is seen talking about his ordeal during his arrest and about abuses of power, not about Gates seeking vaccination powers. He says:Following my abduction, I was shown a petition authored and engineered by Gbajabiamila and the clerk of the House of Representatives forwarding a resolution of the House where the police were directed to arrest me following comments I made about the shady attempt to pass the Control of Infectious Diseases Bill, comments that I strongly stand on for, which even in international and local fora we have been commended for standing against the plot of using of our legislature to pursue sinister objectives.In the video, Ugochinyere says the speaker cannot form a committee to look into himself. Further, he objects to the powers that the health bill will give to police to round up sick people.Reacting, a proponent of the bill, House member Benjamin Kalu, told THISDAYLIVE.com:""The Bill is still being baked and Nigerians should make their input through their representatives or during public hearing and thereafter be patient to see the final copy which I'm sure will take care of all our concerns.""Nowhere in these proceedings were vaccinations mentioned. In fact, objections inside Nigeria had everything to do with the wording of the bill and nothing to do with money from Gates. The Nigerian Control of Infectious Diseases Bill is described as ""draconian and anti-democratic,"" according to a commentary aired on May 19 as part of ARISE NEWS. In the broadcast, Liborous Oshoma, a Nigerian attorney says the bill is:unfit for a democratic environment. Many sections are anti-constitution. They empower police to arrest without warrants a person who has infectious disease.""The bill extends arrest powers in cases where a citizen has not committed a crime but is only sick, he says. Also, he objects because much of the wording in the bill was""plagiarized from Singapore,"" and the word ""Nigeria"" replaced the name ""Singapore"" on many pages where the rest is word for word the same as a law in Singapore. Oshoma says, ""It's a lazy piece of work.""The Nigerian bribe claim was debunked by InfoTagion in an article titled Factcheck: Did Bill Gates bribe Nigeria to test vaccines on children? published on June 3, 2020. It reads:This is false, whilst the Gates Foundation does fund vaccine research there is no record of a payment of this amount. The Nigerian House of Representatives have been considering the Infectious Diseases Control Bill, which this article makes reference to. The Bill has been controversial as some perceive that it gives too much power to the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control in the management of infectious diseases, with some concerned that it could infringe on human rights with the power to issue fines to citizens for noncompliance.""There have been many iterations of the Bill-Gates-forced-vaccine rumor -- sometimes the fictional victims are children, sometimes women, sometimes a bribe is involved (recently it was $50 million to the WHO) or it's alleged that he ""admits to"" harming 700,000 people.Ten countries in Africa are currently recipients of Gates philanthropy: Ethopia, Nigeria, South Africa, Burkina Faso, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ghana, Kenya, Senegal, Tanzania, and Zambia.

"Why don't you wear masks for tuberculosis?
Why weren't you wearing a mask when tuberculosis killed over ONE MILLION people last year?
Why weren't you wearing a mask when tuberculosis killed OVER ONE MILLION people in 2018?
Why weren't you wearing a mask when you researched that tuberculosis ACTUALLY spreads through the air (within feet), person to person?
I'll tell you why.
Because the media didn't tell you to wear a mask for tuberculosis. Because you were not instructed to worry about tuberculosis.","Should you ignore the warnings to wear a mask to protect against COVID-19 since the media and government are not also warning you to wear a mask to protect against tuberculosis? No, that's not true: COVID-19 is far more prevalent and deadly than tuberculosis in the United States. As of this writing, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than one million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the United States since January 21, 2020 -- and more than 65,000 people have died. By contrast, using the most recent CDC numbers available, 515 people died from tuberculosis in the U.S., in 2017.A widely shared meme asked why people have not been wearing face masks to protect against TB, even though it's a deadly disease. One version (archived here) was posted on Facebook on April 30, 2020. It opened with a demand for answers:Why don't you wear masks for tuberculosis?Why weren't you wearing a mask when tuberculosis killed over ONE MILLION people last year?Why weren't you wearing a mask when tuberculosis killed OVER ONE MILLION people in 2018?Why weren't you wearing a mask when you researched that tuberculosis ACTUALLY spreads through the air (within feet), person to person?I'll tell you why.Because the media didn't tell you to wear a mask for tuberculosis. Because you were not instructed to worry about tuberculosis.This is what the post looked like on Facebook at the time of writing:   Another post takes it further, saying the media and ""multi billion dollar institutions"" are effectively trying to strip people of their freedoms.Neither meme makes it clear whether they are talking about U.S. or global numbers. So, we'll take a look at both.The World Health Organization, indeed, reports that 1.5 million people died from tuberculosis around the world in 2018. And the group does call tuberculosis one of the top 10 causes of death worldwide. The CDC has yet to report 2018 death toll in the U.S. from TB, but cases were at the lowest levels since at least 1953, at 9,025 cases.With that number of cases, it is impossible to see how one million people could have died in the U.S. from TB that year.Globally, the WHO also reports that eight countries -- India, China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Pakistan, Nigeria, Bangladesh and South Africa -- accounted for 66% of the new cases in 2018, and the U.S. is not among them. In the U.S., again according to the CDC, there were 9,025 cases of TB in 2018 in this country.Though the tallies aren't yet finalized for 2019, the CDC says preliminary numbers indicate there were 8,920 cases of TB in the U.S. last year.Part of the meme is accurate. For example, it is true that both TB and COVID-19 can be spread person-to-person, through respiratory droplets, when an infected person, for example, talks, sneezes or coughs. Thus, the CDC guidance for everyone to wear masks.But they not the same -- at all. TB is a caused by a bacteria, and COVID-19 is caused by a virus. There are effective drug treatments and a vaccine for TB. Meanwhile, laboratories and doctors around the world are in a desperate push to develop a coronavirus vaccine.The statistics don't lie: the coronavirus is a much more deadly threat now than tuberculosis in the U.S., and this is particularly clear when you look at the numbers of TB cases for an entire year and compare them against COVID-19 cases for a matter of a few months.Worldwide, there have been at least 239,350 coronavirus-related deaths since the outbreak in December 2019. The U.S. has the highest toll with at least 65,711 deaths.In fact, COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, kills more people in a day in some cities in the U.S. than TB does in an entire year in the entire country.As for the media, it is unclear which outlets or publications are being attacked here. But nearly all major outlets and publications, from conservative to liberal media, have reported on the seriousness of the crisis now being faced with the coronavirus.The media is simply reporting the news, which includes CDC guidance -- not trying to manipulate or trick people -- when they advise the use of face masks during this pandemic.",False,"May  1, 2020"

Some of the substituted stories make no mention of the city in the headline, or they mention another city. For example, the Wichita story (originally attributing the fictional paper 'Kansas News Today') has been replaced by a story that was from taken, word for word, from News Channel 6 - a real news station based in Wichita Falls (read their article here). (News Channel 6 may real, but it's in Texas, not Kansas.)Currently, the revised cbtvn.com Wichita story is titled, ""Coronavirus confirmed in Electra ISD not related to China outbreak"" and starts like this:ELECTRA, Texas (TNN) - An outbreak of the coronavirus has been confirmed at Electra ISD, but it's not the same virus sweeping the globe and infecting thousands every day.Coronavirus is a very broad term for a family of viruses, including the common cold; and the district's superintendent wanted to make sure parents know the outbreak happening is nothing more than a cold.This story was placed in local Facebook groups by at least three different profiles from Ghana. These profiles most likely have been stolen from the original owners and are being run solely to amplify the content of this publisher. The Annor profile posts links to several different websites in this network. They are associated by a common Google Analytics code - as well as by common behaviors that are similar to sites from an earlier network in Ghana that we wrote about in April 2018. For example:Repeating the same story with locations/names changed.Using dashes, ""news"", ""tv"" or ""radio"" in domain names.Promoting death hoaxes (the same sites published multiple fake death stories all set in Toronto, Canada).Using the MGID ad network for monetization.Filling their front pages with ""real"" news copied from other sites.Spreading links to the hoax stories through fake Facebook profiles on various local and buy-and-sell Facebook groups/pages.By themselves, the individual methods may not be enough to make the connection. But, taken together, they strongly suggest it is the same person or people behind the operation. Another trick employed by this clickbaiter was to turn off the commenting on the posts planted by these spamming profiles. This tactic prevented other members of the group from discussing, questioning or raising alarm about the fake news. Annor posted in Spanish-speaking groups based in Los Angeles, while Duncan targeted the Denver story to three Hispanic Facebook groups in the Denver area, and Duncan also posted in three Pakistani groups. Eviana's post in the Baltimore Vendor's Network Group - with only 6,000 members - garnered over 1,000 shares.

The post contained the exact quotes featured in this latest version.Gillard never made the inflammatory statements. The viral message has been attributed to other former Australian prime ministers, including John Howard and Kevin Rudd.According to Snopes, the source of several quotes is an editorial by U.S. Air Force veteran Barry Loudermilk, who wrote, ""This Is America.

These are my people not her people.Freaking disgusting.,"Is Kamala Harris not an American Black considering that her parents are Indian and Jamaican and was she lying when she said she was part of the second class to be integrated at her elementary school? No, neither is true: While racial definitions in the United States are controversial, the federal government's definition of ""Black or African American"" includes persons ""having origins in any of the Black racial groups of Africa... and Afro-Caribbean entries, such as Haitian and Jamaican,"" according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The California senator falls into the legal definition of ""American Black,"" despite attacks from political opponents who accuse the Democratic presidential contender of stealing the heritage of families with longer histories in the country. Also, the Berkeley school district confirmed her elementary school was segregated until a year before Harris started kindergarten, contrary to claims it was integrated six years earlier.Questions of Sen. Harris's racial identity have followed her throughout her political career, but they grew louder in the wake of her strong performance in her first presidential debate appearance in which chided former Vice President Joe Biden's record on forced school busing in the 1970s. President Trump's eldest son retweeted a tweet  (archived here) posted on June 27, 2019 that read:Kamala Harris is *not* an American Black. She is half Indian and half Jamaican.

She then recalled a story about neighbors who wouldn't let their children play with Harris and her sister ""because we were black."" She then questioned Biden's record on race, specifically his cooperation with southern senators to ""oppose busing"" in the 1970s. ""There was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public school, and she was bused to school every day. That little girl was me.""Watch this debate moment below:Harris was born in Oakland, California, in 1964. She lived with her mother, a cancer researcher born in India, after her Jamaican-born father, a university professor, moved out following a divorce when Kamala was seven. Her mother moved her to Montreal, Canada, during her high school years, but she then returned to the United States where she attended Howard University, a historically black college.""Kamala Harris's father's family owned slaves,"" Alexander said, suggesting this disqualified her from claiming to be a Black American.Yes, her father did write in an article titled ""Reflections of a Jamaican Father"" that there was a white slave owner far up his family tree. Some rightwing blogs mislead readers to think it was her great-grandmother, while it was actually a more distance ancestor:My roots go back, within my lifetime, to my paternal grandmother Miss Chrishy (née Christiana Brown, descendant of Hamilton Brown who is on record as plantation and slave owner and founder of Brown's Town) and to my maternal grandmother Miss Iris (née Iris Finegan, farmer and educator, from Aenon Town and Inverness, ancestry unknown to me). The Harris name comes from my paternal grandfather Joseph Alexander Harris, land-owner and agricultural 'produce' exporter (mostly pimento or all-spice), who died in 1939 one year after I was born and is buried in the church yard of the magnificent Anglican Church which Hamilton Brown built in Brown's Town (and where, as a child, I learned the catechism, was baptized and confirmed, and served as an acolyte).Hamilton Brown was born in Ireland in 1776 and immigrated to Jamaica, where he became a prominent sugar planter and owner of slaves, according to one historical record. Brown died in 1843 at the age of 68, 46 years before Kamala Harris's paternal great-grandmother Christiana Brown (known as Miss Chrishy) was born and 121 years before Kamala's birth. This would make it likely that the slave owner Brown was at least seven generations removed from Kamala.This is a photo of Kamala Harris's paternal great-grandmother Miss Chrishy, published in Donald Harris's article.This is a photo of great-grandmother Miss Iris, holding young Kamala in her lap in 1966.But this shows a common history with a large number of American Blacks, according to Henry Louis Gates Jr., the Harvard historian and host of the PBS series ""Finding Your Roots."" The five DNA testing companies that work with his project found that the average African American has between 20% and 29% European DNA, Gates wrote in an article titled ""Exactly How 'Black' Is Black America?""A whopping 35 percent of all African-American men descend from a white male ancestor who fathered a mulatto child sometime in the slavery era, most probably from rape or coerced sexuality. In other words, if we tested the DNA of all of the black men in the NBA, for instance, just over one-third descend from a white second or third great-grandfather.Having a white slave owner as a great-great-great-great-great grandfather does not rule Kamala Harris out as being African American. Instead, it gives her commonality with a large percentage of African Americans.Harris responded to critics in a radio interview in February, 2019:I think they don't understand who black people are, because if you do, if you walked on Hampton's campus, or Howard's campus, or Morehouse or Spelman or Fisk, you would have a much better appreciation for the diaspora, for the diversity, for the beauty in the diversity of who we are as black people... I am black and I am proud of it. I was born black and I'll die black and I am proud of it. And I am not gonna make any excuses for it, for anybody, because they don't understand.While political critics can shape their personal definitions of race, the U.S. Census Bureau that offers the official definition in a government report titled ""DEFINITION OF BLACK OR AFRICAN AMERICAN USED IN THE 2010 CENSUS"":""Black or African American"" refers to a person having origins in any of the Black racial groups of Africa.The Black racial category includes people who marked the ""Black, African Am., or Negro"" checkbox. It also includes respondents who reported entries such as African American; Sub-Saharan African entries, such as Kenyan and Nigerian; and Afro-Caribbean entries, such as Haitian and Jamaican.Skeptics of Harris's claim in the debate that she was part of the second kindergarten class to integrate her elementary school cite photos from a 1963 year book for a high school in Berkeley, California showing black students. Since there was only one high school in the district, it was by default integrated. It was not until 1968 that the several elementary schools in Berkeley were integrated, Natasha Beery, director of community relations for the Berkeley Unified School District, told CNN:Thousand Oaks Elementary, along with all Berkeley public elementary schools, were integrated through a two-way busing plan, beginning in 1968, so Senator Harris is correct in describing her experience in 1969 as the second year of the busing integration program.You can read the history of that district's integration process in this report titled ""A radical decision, an unfinished legacy.""Sen. Harris shared a photo of her as a young child with her mother and sister on Instagram in February 2020:They post was accompanied with this message:My mother was very intentional about raising my sister, Maya, and me as strong, Black women. She coupled her teachings of civic duty and fearlessness with actions, which included taking us on Thursday nights to Rainbow Sign, a Black cultural center near our home. ⁣ ⁣ There we were always greeted with warm hugs and exposed to extraordinary people like Shirley Chisholm, Nina Simone, and Maya Angelou who helped show us what we could become.

Beginning this past January, the new Norwegian Prime Minister, Erna Solberg began a program which targets and deports Muslims who have ties to radical groups. Something stunning occurred: the country's ...The story suggested that Norway's (fictional) experience with deporting Muslims could be an example for other countries:Liberals everywhere are crying ""Racism!"" Al Jazeera has blasted Solberg relentlessly for her so-called ""Islamophobia"", but she has pressed on by deporting any Muslims who belong to radical mosques or threaten violence against ""non-believers"" -- and sent their entire families home too.While many in America would say this is racist, it's worked in dramatic fashion. Violent crimes are down more than 31% in Norway.What a shocker.Perhaps the rest of Europe and the United States could learn a lesson or two about radical Islam here. Deport the radicals, keep the moderates, and everybody wins.This 2019 story is identical to an article published on November 15, 2014, by a now-defunct website PoliticalEars.com. That story titled ""IS ANYBODY SURPRISED? NORWAY DEPORTS MUSLIMS, CRIME RATE DROPS 31%"" is now offline, but it is archived here and below is a screenshot:The truth about Norway's immigrant deportation program can be found in a report from the Library of Congress titled ""Norway: Government Plans to Crack Down on Returning Foreign Convicts"" published on March 11, 2013.The Norwegian government is reforming two aspects of immigration policy related to foreign convicts in the country. As reported on February 22, 2013, the Ministry of Justice and Public Security is formulating changes in the law in order to send returning foreign convicts back out of Norway and to enhance punishments against the offenders.On June 7, 2011, the Norwegian Parliament ratified legislation to accord the police extended powers to send foreign inmates back to Latvia, Lithuania, and Romania, under bilateral agreements signed with these countries.It targeted ""foreign convicts,"" not Muslims. In fact, only one majority-Muslim country -- Iraq -- was among the top five origins of the deported convicts, the report said:Norwegian Broadcasting reported in June 2011 that about 30% of convicts serving prison terms in Norway were foreign citizens, with those from Poland leading the list, ""followed by Lithuania, Nigeria, Iraq and Romania.""The Norwegian newspaper Aftenposten reported that, in 2011, 794 foreign convicts were deported, based on an innreiseforbud, a formal order disallowing re-entry to Norway. In 2012, similar orders were issued for another 1,019 foreign convicts, as part of a concerted government effort to enforce the law allowing expulsion when foreigners have committed crimes.That was a 2013 report. A more recent accounting of deportations in 2018, published on June 26, 2019 said:Sweden tops the list of countries the deportees were sent to with 512 people. Then Italy follows with 394, Poland with 333, Romania with 267 and Russia with 261 people.Poland and Russia are at the top of the statistics of the citizenship of the emigration with 284 citizens each. Ukraine is in third place with 278 emigrants, followed by Albania with 272 and Romania by 266.Individuals with citizenship from these five countries alone account for almost one-third of the forced deportations so far this year.Crime rates have been dropping in Norway, but the 31 percent decline cited in the story is not based on fact. The U.S. Department of State's most-recent assessment of crime in Norway said:There is minimal risk from crime in Oslo. Norway has a relatively low level of crime in comparison to the U.S. and most of Western Europe. The total amount of crime reported in Oslo for 2017 decreased from 2016 by 5.6%.The majority of the criminal cases reported to the police continue to be theft-related incidents. In Oslo and the other major urban areas, crime centers on the inner city and high-transit areas. Instances of pickpocketing and petty theft are common in the major tourist areas, hotel lobbies, and in the areas around train and transit stations. Most hotels and tourist areas are located within walking distance of Oslo's higher crime areas, making instances of property crime and/or petty theft more likely to occur.Thefts are the overwhelming majority of cases reported. There were 94,887 reports of theft in 2017, a 9.8% decrease from the previous year. Violent and weapons-related crimes (including physical/non-physical threats) increased 4.3% from 34,969 reports in 2016 to 36,687 in 2017. These crimes usually occur in areas known to have drug trafficking and gang problems, such as certain parts of Eastern Oslo and elsewhere. Sexual crimes increased the most (11%) from 7,079 reports in 2016 to 7,986 in 2017. Some of the increase in attempted rape and rape statistics is due to of changes to criminal sexual conduct laws.Organized crime does operate in Norway, but on a small scale. Drug trafficking, petty theft, and home burglary rings typify organized crime, which is often associated within immigrant youth communities or transiting criminal rings from outside of Norway. Reports of crimes involving drugs decreased 6.7%, from 50,293 reports in 2016 to 46,930 in 2017.NewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalist to rank the reliability of websites, describes trump-feed.com as:A conservative site that re-posts stories from other sites without credit, including many that are false.According to NewsGuard the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.

According to some foreign media it is rumored that Ronaldo has decided to donate 1.5 million euros to the Palestinians.As soon as this news has been made public, many Muslims have thanked Ronaldo for this wonderful and at the same time extraordinary gesture.Cristiano Ronaldo has many Muslim friends with whom he visits popular Arab countries. Below you can see a photo of him a few years ago with a scarf that was in the colors of the flag of Palestine. This gesture had irritated the Israelites.The site did not specify on which ""foreign websites"" it was ""rumored"". We found at least two other Albanian websites making the claim on May 14, 2019: Albanien Show (archived here) and FaktiDitor (archived here).Based on these reports it appears a Twitter account named ""@onwa_dan"" picked up the ""news"" on May 16 (tweet archived here), changing the currency of the donation in the process:Cristiano Ronaldo donate $1.5m to Palestine Gaza.

He said the masked attackers were yelling racial and homophobic slurs, and that one said ""This is MAGA country,"" a reference to Donald Trump's slogan ""Make America Great Again.""Sen. Kamala Harris, a California Democrat, tweeted that day that Smollett ""is one of the kindest, most gentle human beings I know."" She then concluded the attack was ""an attempted modern day lynching."".@JussieSmollett is one of the kindest, most gentle human beings I know. I'm praying for his quick recovery. This was an attempted modern day lynching. No one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or color of their skin. We must confront this hate.-- Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) January 29, 2019Sen. Cory Booker, a New Jersey Democrat, also tweeted that day that it was ""an attempted modern-day lynching,"" which he said should be made a federal hate crime.The vicious attack on actor Jussie Smollett was an attempted modern-day lynching.

Police charged Smollett with filing a false police report on February 20, 2019.Sen. Harris posted a Facebook message that day saying she was ""sad, frustrated, and disappointed.""He was indicted by a grand jury for 16 felonies on March 8, 2019.Controversy erupted later in the month when prosecutors announced all charges were dropped with Smollett agreeing to forfiet his $10,000 bond and complete 16 hours of community service. Chicago authorities were still sorting through questions about how police, prosecutors, and the court handle the Smollett case, with calls for special prosecutor to be named to investigate.The unusual handling of the Smollett case proved to be good fodder for exaggerted and inaccurate reporting, including one that claimed an ""unnamed source"" said Smollett's phone records showed over 200 calls and texts from Kamala Harris and DNC operatives. The report said that revelation is what led to the charges being dismissed.One apparent origin of the mythical conspiracy is an anonymous message on a 4Chan thread (archived here) posted on February 15, 2019:This puppy is tied to Kamala. There is a chance this will come out. CPD is pissed about the situation. They had the phone records before the spreadsheet was given to them.

Barely a week later a similar site pretending to be the New York Times got a quarter million likes, shares and comments on a false story claiming her husband George H.W. Bush had now also died at the age of 93.Fake News: Former First Lady Barbara Bush Did NOT Die At 92 (UPDATE: She Did Now) | Lead StoriesSTORY UPDATED: check for updates below. UPDATE: Barbara Bush did now pass away on April 17, 2018 as reported by the NY Times: As the wife of the 41st president and the mother of the 43rd, George W. Bush, Mrs.(Facebook engagement count of Barbara Bush death hoax, courtesy of get.trendolizer.com)To give some perspective on those 2.3 million engagements: BuzzFeed News published a list of the top 50 fake news articles of 2017 at the end of last year. The stories in positions one and two on that list received 1.2 and 1.1 million Facebook engagements respectively. The Barbara Bush death hoax got those amounts combined and most of it happened in a single day. Yikes!An investigation by Lead Stories in collaboration with Jeremy Massler of Manic News has now revealed the origin of these sites and the many, many other ones that made up a vast network of fake news websites that had been operating since at least the beginning of 2016. The hub of the network seems to be centered in Ghana, Africa. Move over Veles, Macedonia, the new capital of fake news might just be Accra.The NetworkLet's start from the beginning: the site breaking-cnn.com that published the Barbara Bush death hoax was being used to promote the (now defunct) Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/World-News-1061040047315656 back in September of 2017 according to records kept by Lead Stories.That same page was also promoted at various points in time by these websites (all defunct now):breaking-bbc.co.ukradiogtv.comtv-bbc.comusanews-tv.comFrom these sites Lead Stories was able to drill down into the network by comparing advertising tags, Google Analytics ID's, IP adresses, historic WHOIS records and various other bits & pieces of data. In the end we found over 80 connected sites, you can see the full list here along with some of the properties we used to link them to each other and a list of their most popular articles on Facebook (and the number of engagements there).The site breaking-cnn.com had ID's from the MGID advertising network on it (212510 and 223718) which were also found on these two sites, neatly linking the Bush death hoaxes together:theguidian.com nytimes-news.comBoth these sites were recently used for spreading death hoaxes and on both we found a code from the MGID advertising network linking it to the site dream1k.com (archived here), which offers to donate $1000 to someone that needs it according to its about page:Welcome to Dream1k.com. Dream 1k is a philanthropic project embarked on by Travel Blogger, Akesse Sanza of Jetsanza.com.Dream 1k is here to unlock potentials by providing funding for persons who think $1,000 can help them run a business, handle educational needs, pay off medical bills, run a community project, or any special activity that seeks to develop persons or the society.Dream1K is hosted on the IP address 198.71.233.195 which is also used by jetsanza.com and several other sites in the fake news network (most notably glonews360.com). But more about that in a moment.Fake news themes & tacticsWhen looking at the sites in the network and the types of fake stories posted on them several patterns started to emerge. Many of the sites would hide their true nature by only publishing real news copied from legitimate sources on their front pages while hiding the hoaxes on pages deeper down. Generally the domain names of the sites were chosen to resemble the names of legitimate news outlets but with things like 'news', 'breaking', 'tv' or 'channel' added to it: bbc-tv.com, nytimes-news.com, tv-cnn.com, breaking-cnn.com, cnn-channel.com, elpais-tv.com. Other times the names were simple misspellings or letter/number substitutions of real news website domain names: theguidian.com, 1ndependent.co.uk, m1rror.com.Stories from the network were sometimes aimed at audiences in different specific regions or countries but these would often appear side by side on the same site with articles meant for completely different audiences. We found news about politicians, celebrities and local issues from the Caribbean, various African countries, the Philippines, various European countries, the U.S., Australia, Latin America... Some sites would even mix articles in English, French or Spanish. Very often the same articles would be repeated over and over again but with names and places changed or even translated in a different language.One popular theme was visa-free travel to the United States or Europe soon becoming possible from a country or region. We debunked several such stories in the past mentioning Guyana, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, The Phillipines, Nigeria, Uganda, Ghana And Malawi, Ghana, Ethiopia And Kenya, the entire Caribbean...Another favorite trope was celebrities being arrested at an airport with 2kg (or sometimes 20kg) of cocaine. Here's a recent example of a story like that. Or the story about a restaurant serving human meat that kept happening in different cities all over the world. Or a story about a local kid getting 30 million dollars and a lifetime scholarship from Apple. Or stories about celebrities donating whopping sums of money to hurricane victims.The thing the network is most famous for is a long string of death hoaxes culminating in the premature Barbara Bush death announcement that netted those 2.3 million engagements on Facebook. Usually a few days after mainstream news sources would report some celebrity or politician was ill or had been hospitalized the network would put out a death hoax claiming the person had passed away. Sceptical readers would find plenty of mainstream news reports about the victim being very ill or in hospital and would just assume the hoax site got the scoop on the death announcement. Famous victims of this practice include David Cassidy, Ken Dodd, Charles Manson, Malcom Hebden, Morgan Tsvangirai and recently George H.W. Bush. Note that in some cases the person actually did die a few days later.The network monetized its sites using various ad networks like Google Adsense, ContendAd and MGID at different times.Connecting the dots: Agnes, Glorian and AkesseBack in February 2018 while researching the WHOIS information behind the domain names of two sites connected to the network (fox-news24.com and usa-television.com) the name ""Agnes Arthur"" popped up, a woman supposedly living in Accra, Ghana. We were unable to locate any social media profiles matching the description (there seem to be a lot of Agnes Arthur's in Ghana though).A Google search revealed this article (archived here) on fact checking site memebuster.net that claimed a Facebook user by that name had been posting a pro-Duterte fake news story from network site usa-radio.com to a Filipino Facebook group.Alex Kaplan, a writer at MediaMatters, recently noted that a Facebook account belonging to ""Glorian Maame Nyarkoh"" (archived) had been spamming the Barbara Bush hoax in a variety of Facebook groups. Glorian's profile indicates she lives in Ghana, and she has a long history of sharing links to these hoax sites. We found a second Facebook profile using her name and profile picture that was friends with the profile of Akesse Sanza, the blogger from Ghana we mentioned earlier who runs jetsanza.com.A glance through Nyarkoh's posting history shows she has a long history of posting hoaxes from the network onto Facebook: for example she shared a texas-express.com article in September, 2017 about an alleged gang rape carried out by rescue workers during Hurrican Harvey. On November 16, 2016, Nyarkoh shared a cbn-tv.com article claiming South Korean President Park Geun-hye had resigned (an event that never occurred).Calling Ghana...We tried contacting the phone number of Agnes Arthur found in the domain name registration records but got a very confused sounding woman over a terrible mobile connection who wasn't able to provide us any information. In the morning of April 24, 2018 we also sent email and Facebook messages to Nyarkoh and Sanza asking if they knew about some of the sites, Agnes Arthur and each other.Both replied. Nyarkoh said she didn't know Sanza but she did know Agnes and that it was her friend. When confronted with a second Facebook profile we found with her name and her picture that was friends with Sanza's profile she said it was hacked and she didn't know Facebook friends in person.Sanza on the other hand said he did know Nyarkoh but denied working together. He said Agnes Arthur ran the hosting on his websites but he didn't have any contact information for her except her email address (which matched the one we found in the WHOIS records). He claimed he couldn't find any of her social media profiles because it seemed like she deleted them and stated he met her through a Facebook advertisement. He also mentioned he should probably be getting his own hosting soon, explaining that he owned the jetsanza.com domain but that Arthur hosted it.We also contacted the Agnes Arthur email address (mentioning two of the websites in the network and saying Sanza gave us her info) and got back a short reply:Yes he forwarded me your email. I do own three of them and just deleted them after receiving your forwarded message.If it's truly large, then they may belong to some of my clients. I do host sites for people as well.The network goes darkShortly after our initial contact with Sanza, Nyarkoh and Arthur several of the websites in the network went offline, including some of the ones that had been most active recently: breaking-cnn.com, nytimes-news.com, theguidian.com, texas-express.com, glonews360.com and stluciantimes.com.Simultaneously the public Facebook page for Akesse Sanza with over 200.000 fans was suddenly restricted to just visitors from Ghana:So, who is really behind the network?The person behind the Agnes Arthur email claimed to have owned and deleted three of the sites. That leaves about 80 other sites that we know of. All run by her 'clients'? And if she only owned three, why did all of them go dark all of a sudden along with Sanza's public page? And why do they all follow the same pattern when it comes to content, naming style and advertising networks?Our investigation continues: we found some very interesting news articles and social media posts that merit further investigation and we are preparing a follow-up article that will do a deeper dive into how this network operated and how it got its stories to trend. To be continued...Addendum: the list of sites in the networkUpdates:2018-04-25T22:11:23Z2018-04-25T22:11:23Z          The Facebook page of Akesse Sanza seems to be accessible to the rest of the world again.

  Maarten Schenk","Question: What do British singer David Cassidy, American serial killer Charles Manson, British comedian Ken Dodd, Zimbabwean opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai and British actor Malcom Hebden have in common?Answer: They were all declared dead recently by the same network of fake news websites shortly after they were admitted to hospital with various health problems. (In the case of Cassidy and Manson the fake news about their deaths unfortunately became real news a few days later when they eventually did pass away.)This seems to be the newest trick in the book of a group of fake news websites: look for news about a well-known celebrity being taken to hospital, wait a few days and then announce that person has sadly passed away. Skeptics who do Google around a bit for confirmation before sharing the article will find a slew of news reports from well respected news outlets all saying the person was in hospital (likely with severe health problems) so the news of the death seems plausible enough to pass on without further scrutiny. Usually that's all it takes to make the death hoax go viral, allowing the site operators to cash in on the advertising revenue windfall.Who?But who is behind these sites?The David Cassidy death hoax was published by city-herald.com.The Ken Dodd death hoax emerged via abcnewgo.com (a site mimicking the real domain name of abcnewsgo.com by omitting the letter 's').The Charles Manson death hoax appeared on texas-express.com and florida-times.com.The Malcom Hebden death hoax showed up via miami-express.com and florida-times.com.The Morgan Tsvangirai death hoax was pushed via allafricanews.co.za.Looking at them a little closer they all have several features in common:All sites appear to be running on the popular Wordpress publishing software.Their domain names tend to mimick existing news websites or pretend to be local news sources.Their main pages generally contain articles copied verbatim from mainstream news websites also found in Google News. For example, on city-herald.com we found stories from LA Times, Channel NewsAsia, Washington Post, NBC News, Bloomberg, Reuters, ABC News and MSN, all without attribution.Often the fake stories don't appear on the main page at all, sometimes they don't even show up in the RSS feed for the site. This can be done relatively easily in Wordpress for example with the Hide Post plugin.Except for allafricanews.co.za the domain names were all registered anonymously via the same domain name registrar ('Wild West Domains, LLC"").As this article from DFRLab points out, the AllAfricaNews.co.za site was registered under the name of one ""Tumelo Belebesi"" but it was unclear if this was the actual person behind the site.NetworkAll of the sites are part of a larger network. Using the fingerprinting feature in our Trendolizer engine we were able to piece together several links connecting the sites together as illustrated in this graphic:Sites in the network are monetized using the ContentAd and MGID ad networks which allowed us to identify several sites sharing identical Widget ID's and domain codes. This means the money made from those ads goes to the same people.Some of the sites also used common IP addresses (note: some of the sites appear to live on multiple different IP addresses because of the way the sites are hosted). Two sites being on the same IP doesn't have to mean they are connected, it could just be they are using the same hosting provider. But if there are more links like shared advertising IDs or other connections it usually is a pretty good sign of common ownership and that seems to be the case here.Another way to link sites together is by looking at the Facebook App ID or Google Analytics ID used in the HTML code of the pages. We were able to use this information to link several other sites to the network.This graph makes it clear the five death hoaxes are only the tip of the iceberg. Looking back at our own archives we found several examples of very similar hoaxes pushed by these sites claiming President Trump approved visa free travel to the United States for citizens of various countries or regions: Guyana, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, The Phillipines, Nigeria, Uganda, Ghana And Malawi, Ghana, Ethiopia And Kenya, the entire Caribbean...The Editor/Dash networkAnother interesting tidbit we found in our Trendolizer fingerprints database: most of the sites in the list on the right that share the ""UA-75650730"" Google Analytics ID also used to have a Facebook page widget promoting a (now defunct) page called ""The-Editor-283812522002681"" (still partially visible with the Wayback Machine).

"President Trump and his administration just voted against a United Nations ban on the death penalty for being gay, making the United States of America (it's hard to think this is actually really happening) just one of 13 other countries in the world to oppose such a historic vote.
A few other notable countries who voted against the ban were China, Iraq and Saudi Arabia, and Egypt.
The resolution wasn't sought to ban the death penalty entirely, but instead to keep it from being imposed in a 'discriminatory manner,' particularly in six countries where the death penalty is used for people known to be in same-sex relationships: Iran, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Yemen, Nigeria, and Somalia.","President Trump and his administration just voted against a United Nations ban on the death penalty for being gay, making the United States of America (it's hard to think this is actually really happening) just one of 13 other countries in the world to oppose such a historic vote.A few other notable countries who voted against the ban were China, Iraq and Saudi Arabia, and Egypt.The resolution wasn't sought to ban the death penalty entirely, but instead to keep it from being imposed in a 'discriminatory manner,' particularly in six countries where the death penalty is used for people known to be in same-sex relationships: Iran, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Yemen, Nigeria, and Somalia.The inflammatory titled did make the article go widely viral each time it was republished and that is probably why it keeps getting reposted even thought the actual U.N. vote it was about occured in October 2017. As NBC News reported back then:The resolution, titled ""The Question of the Death Penalty,"" passed the U.N. Human Rights Council with 27 nations voting in favor, 13 voting against and seven abstentions. The multi-page resolution condemned the imposition of the death penalty when ""applied arbitrarily or in a discriminatory manner"" and specifically condemned ""the imposition of the death penalty as a sanction for specific forms of conduct, such as apostasy, blasphemy, adultery and consensual same-sex relations.""However, the resolution (which you can read in full here) also spoke out against the death penalty in general and that is why the United States voted against it as an official statement from the U.S. government explained:The United States is disappointed that it must vote against this resolution. As in previous years, we had hoped for a balanced and inclusive resolution that would better reflect the position of states that continue to apply the death penalty lawfully. We reaffirm our longstanding position on the legality of the death penalty, when imposed and carried out in a manner consistent with a state's international obligations.We are deeply troubled whenever an individual subject to the death penalty is denied the procedural and substantive protections to which he or she is entitled. We, likewise condemn any instance in which a method of execution or treatment during confinement is applied in such a manner as to amount to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment in violation of a state's international obligations. We cannot accept the implication, however, that all methods of execution have such a result.The same resolution keeps getting proposed again and again (sometimes with minor alterations like the addition of wording about same-sex relations in this case). The United States has always voted against adopting it, even during the Obama administration as pointed out on Twitter by Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N.:Fact: The vote that took place in Geneva is the same US vote that took place under the Obama admin. It was not a vote against LGBT #Fact-- Nikki Haley (@nikkihaley) 4 oktober 2017Fact: There was NO vote by USUN that supported the death penalty for gay people. We have always fought for justice for the LGBT community.-- Nikki Haley (@nikkihaley) 4 oktober 2017Analyzing the full claim in the title ""Trump Votes For Death Penalty For Being Gay"" we can definitely say it is false:""Trump"" - technically it was the Trump administration's representative at the United Nations but we can let that slide.""Votes For"" - the vote was against a U.N. resolution which would technically not even be binding, unlike what ""voting for"" seems to imply (enacting a law).""Death Penalty For Being Gay"" - the vote was about the death penalty in general (including the application of it for same-sex relationships and several other reasons). Not mentioning the things in the rest of the resolution is deeply misleading: it would be like having a vote on the (hypothetical) ""Sunshine, Puppies and Killing Everybody on the Planet Act"" and then saying someone is against sunshine and puppies for having voted against it.So we rate this claim false.",False,"Jan 10, 2018"

In addition to the illegal meat, authorities discovered automatic weapons, grenades, and cell phones. Ten people were arrested in conjunction with the crimes. First clue the story is fake: it is an almost verbatim copy of an earlier story on the same site with the only difference being the location and the currency.  The earlier story placed the events in Valetta, Malta but it was equally false and for the same reasons.Second clue: the picture that accompanies the article is not really a human hand: it actually consists of saussage and prosciutto.The image comes from a 2012 article at Picky Glutton about a fake ""human meat butcher"" set up to promote the video grame ""Resident Evil 6"". This article reads in part:I don't have much time for marketing stunts, but the Wesker and Son pop-up butchers at London's Smithfield Market piqued my interest.
