The articles about the alleged marriage were published alongside the picture of the former president with Cee-C, a reality star.In a post dated December 28, 2021, Heroesghnews, a blog, said “the 86-year-old former president of Nigeria Obasanjo has allegedly just married a 22-year-old girl again.” https://heroesghnews.com/alleged-nigeria-former-president-obasanjos-22yr-old-wife-surface-online/Voice of Africa, a Facebook page with over 26,000 followers, had posted the picture with a caption that reads: “former Nigerian president Obasanjo, at the age of 81, marries 19-year-old girl.” The post has generated over 122 comments, 107 likes and 24 shares.

Cee-C, whose real name is Cynthia Nwadiora, participated in the 2018 edition of the Big Brother Naija reality show. The fashion enthusiast was 25 years old at the time she was featured on the show. Before her stint on the show, the Enugu-born actress had graduated with a law degree from Madonna University in Anambra in 2014. VERIFICATION   First of all, there are inconsistencies with the age of both parties as speculated by the blogs and social media posts.   Cee-C was 29 years old as of the time the picture emerged online.   According to publicly available information, Obasanjo was born in 1937 at Ibogun-Olaogun, Ogun state.    As of 2021, Obasanjo was 84 years old and not 86 as claimed by the blog posts.   The former head of state had married a few times. His ex-wives are Mojisola Adekunle, Stella Abebe, Lynda, and Esther Oluremi. He currently lives in Ogun state with Bola Obasanjo, whom he married in 2009. Now to the origin of the photograph: Cee-C posted the picture on December 13, 2021, saying she had a business meeting with the former president. Corroborating this, Linus Okorie, Nigerian leadership consultant and author, also posted a picture of himself, Nwadiora and the former president, on the same day.   In a now-deleted post, Okorie said the meeting was a preparation for the launch of Guardians of the Nation International (GOTNI ), a nonprofit leadership development organisation. “Had a great meeting today with this great Nigerian. Chief Olusegun Obasanjo our highly respected former president of Nigeria ” he wrote.   “CeeCee a brilliant lawyer and celebrity was a part of the visiting team.

"A social media post has claimed that David Umahi, governor of Ebonyi, said he would support the secession of the south-east region if President Muhammadu Buhari allows the court to oust him as governor. The post was first published on Tuesday on a Facebook page — Anonymous Voice Television ATV — which has 3,693 followers.The post has so far garnered 222 reactions, 361 comments and 249 shares since it was published.“BREAKING NEWS: If Buhari allows the court to remove me upon all my efforts in keeping the party in the south-east, I will officially support Biafra independent with all I’ve got. Dave Umahi warns APC,” the post reads.BACKGROUND On Tuesday,a federal high court in Abuja ordered the removal of Umahi and Eric Kelechi Igwe, as governor and deputy governor of Ebonyi state, following their defection from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the All Progressives Congress (APC).Inyang Ekwo, the judge, held that the 393,042 votes polled by Umahi in the 2019 governorship election belonged to the PDP and cannot be legally transferred to the APC.The court equally sacked16 members of the Ebonyi state house of assembly who defected alongside Umahi.Reacting to the judgement, Umahi, in a press conference on Tuesday, said the court ruling directing his removal from office is “null and void” while accusing Ekwo of doing a “hatchet job”.Amid the controversy arising from the judgement, some posts began to circulate on social media claiming the governor made certain comments.","The claim did not indicate when and where the governor made the statement attributed to him. To verify the comment, TheCable reviewed the comments and statements publicly made by Umahi after the ruling of the federal high court.During the press conference held on Tuesday, which can be viewed here,TheCable observed that Umahi did not make any comment about secession.No credible media platform also published the comment credited to the governor.In a statement, Francis Nwaze, the media aide to the governor, said Umahi did not make such a comment.“The fugitive poster also alleged that Governor Umahi threatened to support Biafra agitations if President Muhammadu Buhari allows the court to remove him,” Nwaze said.“Ordinarily, we wouldn’t have bothered responding to the passing parade but it has become expedient we do so to save our teeming supporters from unnecessary panic owing to the senseless propaganda.“First, no such incident happened today as alleged by the poster who is glaringly acting the script of the haters of good governance and nothing would have warranted such development in the first place.”",false,11/03/2022,https://factcheck.thecable.ng/fact-check-did-umahi-say-hell-support-biafra-if-removed-as-governor/

"A social media post has claimed that the in the last eighteen years, the United States is yet to experience a warming trend.“Zero US warming in 18 years, per US Climate Reference Network temp stations,” reads the caption of the Instagram post.“That’s no US warming despite 30% of total manmade CO2. Emissions-driven warming is a hoax.”The Instagram post was shared on February 27, gathering 437 likes and several comments.“Although no one truly knows the cause, it is undeniable that temperatures have risen over the past 20 years. Look at the temperature records and average snowfall,” reads one of the comments.","Despite the inaccuracy in interpreting the graph sourced from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), a critical look shows an increase in temperature.“As much as I trust the source of the data, the interpretation isn’t correct,” Olusola Ayantobo, a hydro-climatologist and research associate at China’s Tsinghua University, said.TheCable compared annual data from the database of NOAA, which revealed a temperature increase of 0.42 degrees Celsius per decade in the US in the last seventeen years – between 2005 and 2022.The graph shows a temperature increase of 0.42 degrees Celsius per decade in the US between 2005 and 2022.However, experts are of the opinion that more than twenty years of data is needed for accurate climate analysis.“Station data shouldn’t be used to predict climate change conditions over a particular region. Short-term datasets can only be used for weather prediction while a long dataset is appropriate for climate change predictions,” said Ayantobo.In line with the expert opinion that climate analysis requires several years or decades of data, TheCable extended the data analysis to cover a wider time frame by comparing the average temperature between 1901 and 2021, a period of twelve decades.Temperatures in the contiguous 48 states in the US between 1901 and 2021.The outcome of the analysis as shown in the above graph clearly shows the annual average temperatures have changed in the 48 bordering states in the US, since 1901.GLOBAL AVERAGE SURFACE TEMPERATUREApart from the temperature increase in the US, several independent research by experts on surface temperature analysis shows an upward trend in temperature as depicted in the graph below.“Clearly, the earth’s temperature has risen by an average of 0.14° F (0.08° Celsius) per decade since 1880, or about 2° F in total. The rate of warming since 1981 is more than twice as fast: 0.32° F (0.18° C) per decade,” Ayantobo, a climate change expert told TheCable.“Surprisingly last year was the sixth-warmest year on record based on NOAA’s temperature data. The 2022 surface temperature was 1.55 °F (0.86 °Celsius) warmer than the 20th-century average of 57.0 °F (13.9 °C) and 1.90 ˚F (1.06 ˚C) warmer than the pre-industrial period (1880-1900).”EFFECT OF CARBON EMISSION ON GLOBAL WARMINGAlso, the other claim in the Instagram post stating that emissions don’t cause warming is absolutely false. Over the years, increased human activities, essentially the burning of fossil fuels have produced more carbon dioxide (CO2) than natural processes can neutralise or remediate.Increased CO2 has been linked to greenhouse gas which traps heat in the atmosphere and contributes to global warming. With increased warming on the other hand, there is an increase in the rapid melting of sea ice and accelerated rise in sea level, which result in flooding in some cases, and intense heat waves at other times of the year.",false,23/03/2023,https://factcheck.thecable.ng/fact-check-how-true-is-the-claim-that-us-hasnt-warmed-in-18-years/

Out of more than 100 Populus species reported in the world, 53 have been described to occur in China (Xu, 1988; Zhao & Cheng, 1994), and 37 are distributed in North China,” the UN report reads.A closer look at the video shows that the worm-like figures are static and not moving.TheCabe spoke with Carlyn Yakubu, an agronomist, who said the claimed worms on the car “resemble the flower of a Catkin”.“There are some trees called poplar trees and catkins that are commonly grown in China.“Catkin is a type of compact inflorescence, characterized by apetalous flowers that are clustered in a spiral or whorled arrangement (similar to a warm shape) but not exactly worm.”In April 2021, China Daily, a Chinese newspaper, reported that Beijing municipal government issued a statement warning residents of the catkin forecast.The warning was to prepare residents and “related departments deal with the fuzzy mess and remind the public to take necessary prevention measures.”“Beijing has a long history of planting willow and poplar trees.

"A social media post claims that masturbation is one of the primary causes of hair loss in men. The post which was originally posted by a Twitter user, Eric @amerix claimed that frequent ejaculation can be responsible for receding hairlines in men. “One of the primary causes of hair loss is masturbation. Indiscriminate ejaculation leads to the intentional loss of vital nutrients responsible for hair growth. Every time you meet a man with a receding hairline, remind him about semen retention,” the tweet reads.One of the primary causes of hair loss is MASTURBATION.Indiscriminate ejaculation leads to the intentional loss of vital nutrients responsible for hair growth.Every time you meet a man with a receding hairline, remind him about semen retention.#BetterTogether— Eric (@amerix) August 23, 2022","The Merriam-Webster dictionary defined masturbation as the erotic stimulation, especially of one’s own genital organs commonly resulting in orgasm.    According to the definition,  masturbation can be achieved by manual or other bodily contacts exclusive of sexual intercourse, by instrumental manipulation, occasionally by sexual fantasies, or by various combinations of these agencies.    The Cable reached out to medical experts to confirm if there is any scientific evidence to back up the claim that masturbation or indiscriminate ejaculation might lead to hair loss.    Best Ordinioha, a professor of public health and community medicine, dismissed the claim, stating that there is no correlation between receding hairline and masturbation.    According to him, the Twitter user probably put out such a post to attract traffic to his page.   “I think he’s just doing scaremongering and this could also lead to stigma to men who are going bald, when people see them, they think that’s what they do,” the professor of medicine said.   “In health sciences, increased testosterone level is responsible for receding hairline, testosterone is the male hormone. However, there is no scientific evidence to back the claim that indiscriminate ejaculation causes baldness.   “Those with higher testosterone levels may have higher sexual drives but this can be modulated and decreased by a lot of factors: stress can make someone impotent, and sex will probably be the last thing on their minds. I think the poster overstretched it.”    POSSIBLE CAUSES OF HAIR LOSS   Francis Agbaraolorunpo, a medical expert at the University of Lagos, said a couple of factors which include, genetics, medical conditions and excessive usage of chemicals can be responsible for hair loss in men, but definitely not masturbation.    “One of the fundamental causes of baldness is genetics, a person is born with the tendency. The other thing is that a person can inherit it from parents,” he said.    “Some persons who have alopecia or debilitating medical conditions such as cancer can also lose their hair. In such situations, a  female can as well experience hair loss.   “If you see a man with a receding hairline, most likely, there is that gene in the family line, it could have been an unexpressed gene, but the person could express it when the gene aligns with certain environmental conditions.”   However, the medical expert emphasised that masturbation is more of a psychological issue and has nothing to do with hair loss or the physical appearance of a man.    He further disclosed that inferiority complex might also be one of the causes of masturbation in men, adding that “it could lead to infertility issues”.   “A man who masturbates and loses sperm frequently might suffer low sperm count when meeting with a woman.”",false,28/08/2022,https://factcheck.thecable.ng/fact-check-does-masturbation-cause-hair-loss-in-men/

Specifically, the audio has been played over 111.8k times.In the audio file, a voice alleging to be that of Charly Boy could be heard asking Obasanjo, “the only thing I wanted to confirm is if truly, cos we don’t know what is fake news anymore if you had really gone to INEC”.TheCable had debunked disinformation claiming that Obasanjo visited the INEC collation centre in Abuja with the original result sheet.“No. I haven’t,” Obasanjo allegedly responded, adding that “they want to steal the victory. We must not allow them”.Also, a voice sounding like that of the former president said that the youths should protest the election result, hoping that when the nation is paralysed, there would be a solution.Further in the recording, another voice entirely, which appears to be that of Donald Duke, asked Obasanjo about the way forward.“Well, we have done all that we can do now. But, I understand that the youths are not accepting. So, we should make sure that the youths don’t accept. That’s all,” Obasanjo allegedly responded.“The youths should not accept and if they want to kill the youths, let them kill and then they will not live after that.”","To verify the authenticity of the audio clip, the audio was analysed using Python, a high-level, general-purpose programming language.Sample clips from the viral audio were transformed into vectors in a process known as embedding.This same process was also carried out on established audios of Obasanjo, where he spoke at public functions or national platforms. The authentic audio clips of Obasanjo served as the reference audio for the verification process.The samples from the viral video were then compared with the authentic audio clips.Ideally, the process should yield similar scores if the suspected sample is similar to the established audio samples.FIXING OF THRESHOLDIn fake speech detection, a confidence level of 80 percent is targeted, which is the generally accepted threshold for an audio file to be considered similar to the authentic one.The green is a real sample of Obasanjo’s voice, while the red is the viral social media audio clip.In a case where they are below the expected threshold, then the suspected audio sample is considered fake.The viral audio seems to have been generated in line with the Independent National Electoral Commission’s (INEC) refusal to suspend the election result collation process, over widespread violations reported by some Nigerians and opposition parties.Using this embedding method, TheCable compared eight different authentic audio speeches of Obasanjo with the circulating audio.In each case, the viral clip did not match the 80 percent threshold.",mislead,05/03/2023,https://factcheck.thecable.ng/fact-check-circulating-audio-of-obasanjo-donald-duke-was-doctored-to-mislead-nigerians/

"On Monday, Adamu Adamu, the education minister, walked out of an impromptu meeting with students under the auspices of the National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) over the ongoing strike in higher institutions of learning. The Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) had, on February 14, embarked on a one-month warning strike owing to a failed agreement between the association and the federal government.The students, who were led by Sunday Asefon, NANS president, had protested at the federal ministry of education in Abuja demanding an end to the industrial strike in universities. Speaking at the meeting, Asefon claimed the minister publicly celebrated his son who graduated from a university abroad while being dispassionate about the incessant strike in Nigerian institutions. “This is your second term in office, your salary will be paid. The salaries of the lecturers will be paid. We want to really know what is really happening,” the student leader said. “Honourable minister, you celebrated your son who graduated in a country, in a university outside this country. We appreciate that. Our parents do not have that money to send us outside the country, but we are in this country. Weshould enjoy what we are paying for.“We want adequate funding of education in this country, honourable minister, our message is that we want to go back to class. We want our schools to be open.” In his terse reaction, the education minister said instead of protesting at the ministry, the students should have addressed the issues with their lecturers.“Perhaps the only point that you made that is even worthy of attention is that you said students should be involved in this (discussion) and I think it’s probably a good thing,” Adamu said.“And it’s the only thing I’m going to take from everything you have said here. Thank you.” Then, the minister stood up and walked out of the meeting. The video of the meeting had become viral on social media.Following the incident, several media outlets and social media users had claimed that Adamu walked out of the meeting because he felt insulted over Asefon’s statement concerning “his son’s graduation from a foreign university”.

The screenshot received about 142 likes and a few comments.But how true is the claim that carbon dioxide (CO2) emission has no correlation with climate change?","Greenhouse gases (GHGS) like carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide trap heat in the atmosphere, thereby, increasing global temperatures. This further leads to global warming, the long-term heating of the earth due to human activities.Climate change is a long-term variation in the average weather patterns that have come to define local, regional and global climates.A report by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), a US agency that forecasts weather and monitors atmospheric conditions, said in 2021, atmospheric CO2 exceeded 400 parts per million for the first time since the mid-twentieth century.The global average atmospheric CO2 set a new record, by pushing the figure to 414 parts per million, despite the economic drag during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021.The study of chemistry explains that CO2 concentration is heightened as a result of the increased burning of fossil fuels, needed for human energy consumption.Fossil fuels like coal and oil, contain carbon which takes plants millions of years to get rid of in the atmosphere, through the process known as photosynthesis. Unfortunately, the removed CO2 is returned to the atmosphere in just a few hundred years, due to human activities.As a result of the annual increase in atmospheric CO2 in the last decades, the temperature has risen by an average of 0.08 degrees celsius per decade since 1880, or about 2 degrees Fahrenheit in total, according to data from NOAA.Research also reveals that the rate of warming since 1981 has nearly doubled, and as a result, temperatures continue to increase at a rate of more than 0.3 degrees Fahrenheit (0.18° C) per decade since the 1980s.",false,11/03/2023,https://factcheck.thecable.ng/fact-check-yes-carbon-dioxide-has-significant-effect-on-climate-change/
"A post shared on Facebook and WhatsApp claims scent leaf can be used to clean the kidneys without pain. “The years go by and our kidneys always filter the blood, eliminating salt, poison, and all that is harmful in our system,” reads part of an old post that was recently reshared on Facebook. The post claims that over time, salt accumulates in the kidney and requires cleaning treatment. As a cleansing measure, the post advised social media users to boil scent leaves, and drink the filtered tea. “Drink one cup a day and you will see that all the salt and poison accumulated in your kidneys begin to appear when you urinate. This is recognized as the best cleansing treatment for the kidneys and it’s natural,” the post explains. The scientific name of the scent leaf is Ocimum gratissimum. Its other English names are wild basil or tree basil. It is popularly called Ewe Efinrin in Yoruba, Nchuanwu in Igbo, and Daidoya in Hausa. As posted on WhatsApp, the message advised readers to send the post to friends and well-wishers. The kidney is among the vital organs in the body. It is a bean-shaped organ on both sides of the spine, below the ribs. The role of the kidney is to filter blood, remove waste and control the body’s fluid balance.","TheCable spoke with medical experts to confirm if there is scientific evidence to support the use of scent leaves in cleaning the kidney. Theophilus Umeizudike, a nephrologist at the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital said, “there is no scientific evidence to show that scent leaves can be used to clean the kidney”. He further encouraged Nigerians to be wary of the information on social media, particularly if it is not from a certified medical institution. “When people read things online, they should ensure it is from a reputable institution, to ensure that the claim is supported by adequate scientific research and found to be beneficial to help treat an ailment,” he added. TheCable also contacted Awofeso Opeyemi, a research fellow at the Harvard Medical School and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Massachusetts, USA.   She said there is no evidence in medical science that scent leaves can be used to clean the kidney.     “Kidney health doesn’t require so much,” she said, adding that “nature has made it such that taking adequate water every day (ideally, 3 Litres or 12 cups for an adult), can significantly reduce the risk of kidney disease. A clean glass of water will just do, you do not need to add anything to it”.   According to Awofeso, kidney health should include reduced salt intake, drinking lots of water, and early treatment of hypertension.   According to her,  untreated hypertension could lead to kidney failure.   “Hypertension once diagnosed is often life-long and with a few tablets taken daily, as prescribed by a medical doctor, the risk of kidney damage which might require a kidney transplant can be reduced,” she said.   “This is because hypertension usually does not give symptoms until vital organs like the kidney are damaged. Oftentimes, people go to doctors in their 20s or 30s, they are told they have hypertension and given medications, many only take them for a few days and stop.
