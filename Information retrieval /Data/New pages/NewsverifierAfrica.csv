It has been a successful journey for me so far, irrespective of my inability to win the Presidential race of this great nation during my prime in politics, I still thank all Nigerians, and my supporters from other nations who fought the battle with me. This is the end of my political journey, and I wish the present and upcoming leaders of this great nation a successful journey and also advise them to know that leadership tussle is not a do-or-die affair. It is God That enthrones and, as well, dethrones leaders. Moreover, I congratulate the President-elect, ASIWAJU BOLA AHMED TINUBU, and advise him to lead the nation with the fear of Allah. He should shun politics of acrimony and gangsterism. He should sustain the unity that has been existing among us, carry everybody along, and give all Nigerians something to be proud of his administration. Finally, I advise my fellow contestants from other political parties not to seek any court injunction, because I have accepted the defeat in good fate, and also plead fervently with them to follow suit.

The so-called press release did not emanate from me or my office, and it should be treated with repudiation, untrue, and deliberately contrived by those who illegally appropriated the mandate of the Nigerian people.“For the avoidance of any doubt, I wish to state categorically that my lawyers still have my unflinching mandate to challenge the outcome of the February 25 presidential election. I join other lovers of democracy in Nigeria and friends of our great country in the outright rejection of the pre-determined outcome of the February 25 election.“I shall continue to challenge the legality of that election alongside my party, the Peoples Democratic Party. The decision to challenge the sham election of February 25, the worst election in our democratic history, is not predicated on my personal interest but on the interest of Nigeria and its people. It is aimed at deepening democracy and ensuring that we do not confer legitimacy to an outcome of illegitimacy.“My commitment to the democratic struggle in Nigeria is beyond an election season.Atiku Abubakar, Presidential candidate of the People’s Democratic Party and former Vice President of Nigeria, 1999-2007 25th March 2023.”CONCLUSIONThe claim that Atiku Abubakar has retired from active politics is FALSE.Post navigationCLAIM: All the Leading Candidates in the Just Concluded Presidential Election in Nigeria Promised to Remove Fuel Subsidy",Adeyemi,04/04/2023,https://newsverifierafrica.com/claim-pdp-presidential-candidate-atiku-abubakar-retires-from-active-politics/

CLAIM: Bauchi State Commissioner Caught on Camera Buying Votes on Election Day,"Listen to this articleAbidemi KajogbolaOn Saturday, March 18, 2023, a twitter post show a video of a man sharing money to women.The video is purported to have shown the Bauchi state Commissioner for Youth and sport, Alhaji Adamu Manu Soro, sharing money to women.An instagram post by Chief Dele Momodu (@delemomoduovation) also shared the same post , while an Instagram post with the caption “it does not matter when, where and which political party is involved, this is no democracy, also reposted the video.” The instagram post has generated over 56,000 views, 211 comments and 799 likes as of the time of filing this report.VERIFICATIONTo verify the authenticity of the video clip, it was analysed using Deepware. Findings from the AI software revealed that the video is clean and has not been doctored or tampered with.Also, the researcher compared the image of the man sharing money in the video to that of Alhaji Soro, findings revealed that they do not look alike.A further look revealed that police officers in the video are fully dressed in combat uniform and are carrying guns, however security personnel are not allowed to carry firearms at polling centres during the elections in Nigeria. This is a directive by successive Inspector General of Police (IGP) in Nigeria to de-criminalise elections.The IGP also restricted security aides and escorts from accompanying their principals and politicians to polling booths and collation centres during the elections.Meanwhile, Soro has denied being the one in the viral video clip. The state commissioner disclaimed the video in an interview with journalist in Bauchi. He declared that he was not the one in the video clip and threatened legal action against imposters.CONCLUSIONThe video circulating with the claim that Bauchi commissioner was caught on camera buying votes on election day is FALSE.Kajogbola is a volunteer on the N-VA Facts Inclusive Project, funded by the ICFJ.Post navigationHighlights of Fact-checks across Africa from March 20 to March 25  CLAIM: Abia State Had No Permanent Government House Since 1999",Admin,25/03/2023,https://newsverifierafrica.com/claim-bauchi-state-commissioner-caught-on-camera-buying-votes-on-election-day/

CLAIM: Nigeria’s Senators Just Voted against Laws Requesting More Women with Political and Social Power.,"Listen to this articleAdeyemi OkediranOn Wednesday, February 15, 2023, a Twitter user with a pseudo name “Nigerian Woman” (https://twitter.com/nnekacriss) said that Nigerian senators just voted against laws requesting more women with political and social power.The user made this post while responding to another tweet. Her response reads in full, “Thanks for speaking facts. Nigerian senators just voted against laws requesting more women with political and social power. These girls do this money runs because that’s all they are told they need to do to live a good life. Also, men play into it. Men encourage this behaviour.)POTENTIAL IMPACT OF THE CLAIMThe claim that Nigerian senators just voted against laws requesting more women with political and social power has the potential to impact the ongoing conversation around gender equality and women’s empowerment in Nigeria. Also, it could send a negative message to women and girls in Nigeria about their value and the importance of their participation in political and social life. At press time, the tweet had generated 3,556 views, 6 comments, 2 retweets, and 5 likes.VERIFICATIONA web search revealed that the National Assembly recently voted against the two bills that sought to alter sections 48, 49, 71,77,91, and 117 of the 1999 Constitution as amended, by creating one additional senatorial seat and two federal constituencies in each state and FCT for women.‘Bill for an Act to Alter the Provisions of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 to Provide for Special Seat for Women in the National and State Houses of Assembly; and for Related Matters’ would have created 111 extra seats for women at the National Assembly. On its part, the affirmative action bill provided for at least 35 percent position for women in political partiesBoth bills got an abysmal number of votes during the clause-by-clause consideration during the constitution amendment at both chambers of the country’s legislature..During the voting process at the Senate, 30 senators voted for the creation of special seats and 58 voted against it. At the House of Representatives, 81 voted for the bill, while overwhelming 208 lawmakers voted against it. For affirmative action, 34 senators voted for and 53 voted against. The bills did not get the required number of votes to be passed.CONCLUSIONThe claim that Nigerian senators recently voted against laws requesting more women with political and social power is  mostly true. While it is true that the Nigerian Senate rejected bills that sought to increase the participation of women in politics, it cannot be ascertained what constitutes social power. Nonetheless, the rejection of the bill has been widely viewed as a setback for gender equality in Nigeria.Post navigationHas Every Candidate Ever endorsed by Ex-President Olusegun Obasanjo Won the Presidential Election?

POTENTIAL IMPACT OF THE CLAIMThe potential impact of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Governor’s order to shutdown OPay, Kuda, and PalmPay offices in Nigeria could be significant for Nigerians.Firstly, these three companies are major players in the country’s fintech sector, and provide services such as mobile payments, loans, and other financial services to millions of Nigerians. A shutdown could potentially cause panic among users, eventually leading to inconvenience and financial difficulties for many customers who rely on them. If untrue, the negative significant consequences for both the affected companies and their customers, as well as for the wider Nigerian economy cannot be reversed.VERIFICATIONAs of February 17, 2023, there is no evidence to support the claim that the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Governor has ordered the shutdown of OPAY, KUDA, and PALMPAY offices in Nigeria.

Fact-Checking Claims on Sudan’s Independence and Civil Wars’ Deaths,"Listen to this articleA request was submitted via News Verifier Africa, N-VA’s ‘submit a claim’ portal, to fact-check a work-in-progress documentary script on Sudan. The claim was submitted by a television, film and photographic personnel from the British Broadcasting Corporation, BBC.The submitted claim reads: “It is about Sudan and the line I’d like to check is – ‘in 1956 Sudan gained independence. A war between the government and rebels in the South kills almost 2 million people until South Sudan gains its own independence in 2011.’”CLAIMN-VA extracted two claims from the documentary script: “Sudan Gained Independence in 1956,” and “The War between the Government and Rebels in the South Killed almost 2 Million People until South Sudan Gained its own Independence in 2011,” and went on to fact-check the claims.IMPACT OF THE CLAIMThe claim was extracted from a documentary which will be produced by the BBC and it is pertinent to verify the authenticity of the claims and prevent misinformation as the multinational broadcasting company has aviewershipof 489 million adults every weekAlso, the documentary is on the history of Sudan which makes it pertinent to confirm the dates and timeline of events.VERIFICATIONDid Sudan Gain Independence in 1956?Sudan gained independence from the Anglo-Egyptian Condominium, the joint British and Egyptian government that administered Sudan since 1899. From 1924 until Sudan’s independence in 1956, the British had a policy of running Sudan as two essentially separate territories – the north and south.The United Kingdom and Egypt concluded an agreement which provided for Sudanese self-government and self-determination in February 1953 and the transitional period towards independence began with the inauguration of the first Sudanese parliament in 1954.According to the New York Times, the Sudanese parliament, unilaterally and unanimously declared Sudan’s independence on December 19th, 1955. The British and Egyptian governments’ recognized the independence of Sudan on 1st January 1956.What Happened After Sudan’s Independence?Sudan’s sovereignty came with self-government for about 600 ethnic groups speaking over 400 languages and the new country came with a new constitution, the 1956 constitution.Sudanese citizens agitated that the constitution marginalised some territories for not stating whether the new state should be secular or an Islamist state and failed to address the country’s federal structure.Sudan’s First Civil warAccording toGlobal Security, the Arab-led Khartoum government defaulted on its assurances to southerners that it will create a federal system, this led to an uprising by Southern troops in the Equatoria Province. On August 18, 1955, the Equatoria Corps, a military unit composed of southerners mutinied at Torit as they felt cheated and disenfranchised. During the altercation, these rebels did not surrender to Sudanese government authorities, rather they disappeared into hiding with their weapons, marking the beginning of the first war in southern Sudan. This war lasted for seventeen years, from 1955 to 1972.These rebels, later called Anya Nya, were trained by the Israelis while they shipped weapons from Ethiopia, Uganda and Congo. By the late 1960s, the war had resulted in the deaths of about 500,000 people. Government operations against the rebels declined after the 1969 coup. However, when negotiations failed to result in a settlement, Khartoum increased troop strength in the south.In 1971, one of the major leaders of southern forces opposed to Khartoum, Joseph Lagu, proclaimed the creation of the Southern Sudan Liberation Movement (SSLM) and other Anya Nya leaders united behind him. By October 1971, Khartoum established contact with the SSLM which led to the conference between SSLM and Sudanese government delegations convened at Addis Ababa in February 1972. The accord granted many of the agitations of the South, granting them autonomy and recognizing Arabic as Sudan’s official language, and English as the South’s principal language.The Sudanese government issued a decree legalising the agreement and creating an international armistice commission to ensure the well-being of returning southern refugees and amnesty which was backdated to 1955 was also announced. The two sides signed the Addis Ababa accords on March 27, 1972, which was later celebrated as National Unity Day.Sudan’s Second Civil WarIn September 1983, President Jaafar Nimeiri began an Islamization campaign and announced his decision to incorporate traditional Islamic punishments drawn from Shari’a (Islamic Law) into the penal code. The statute of the Islamic law and its punishment also extended to Southerners and other non-Muslims living in the north.Another civil war erupted after Nimeiri institutionalised Sharia Law and reneged on the Addis Ababa Agreement’s provisions for a referendum in Abyei. The Sudan People’s Liberation Army/Movement (SPLM/A) fought against the Sudan national government until 1989 when the parties reached a peace agreement and suspended Sharia Law.However, on June 30, 1989 a military coup led by Omar Al-Bashir overthrew the Sudanese government and repudiated the peace agreement.Through the 1990s, attempts to draft peace agreements hit many setbacks with varying degrees of success recorded. The splintered nature of the conflict and large region posed a constant problem and for years, the national government used aerial bombardments and helicopter gunships to attack the southern Sudanese civilian population. On November 19, 2004, the Government of Sudan and the SPLM/A signed a declaration committing themselves to conclude a final Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) by December 31, 2004. The second civil war came to an end after the two parties formally signed the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) on January 9, 2005.The CPA set standards for sharing oil revenue (50:50 split) and a timetable toward a referendum on the South’s independence. A referendum took place in January 2011 in which the people of the South voted to secede from Sudan. In July 2011, Sudan became two countries – Sudan (Khartoum) and South Sudan (Juba).Did the War between the Government and Rebels in the South Kill almost 2 Million People until South Sudan Gained Independence in 2011?Reliefwebstated that a report released by the U.S. Committee for Refugees (USCR) titled “Quantifying Genocide in Southern Sudan and the Nuba Mountains: 1983-1998,” revealed that at least 1.9 million people in southern and central Sudan have died during the past 15 years as a direct result of civil wars and intentional policies of the Sudan government.Five years before, the USCRpublishedthe first ground-breaking study by Millard Burr reviewing the death toll in Sudan’s long civil war. The study titled, ‘A Working Document: Quantifying Genocide in the Southern Sudan 1983-1993,’ estimated that 1.3 million people had died in southern Sudan due to war and war-related causes.In the Working Document II which waspublishednearly five years after the first and includes specific data on the Nuba Mountains, research suggests that no fewer than 600,000 people have lost their lives since 1993, hence, more than 1.9 million southern Sudanese and Nuba Mountains peoples perished since the civil war began in 1983.According to the report, between 1983 to 1993, foreigners and the media were able to observe the series of catastrophic events that caused the death of tens of thousands, but in subsequent years, the Khartoum government impeded the collection of field data by sealing off war-prone areas from the prying eyes of journalists, aid agencies, and social scientists.CONCLUSIONThe claim that ‘Sudan gained Independence in 1956,’ is verified asTRUEand the second claim that ‘the War between the Government and Rebels in the South killed almost 2 Million People until South Sudan gained its own Independence in 2011,’ isTRUE, according to multiple reports and data sources on the Sudanese war.Post navigationCLAIM: PDP Won All Chairmanship and Councilor Seats at the 2022 FCT Polls  21st April: Africa Fact Check Round-Up",BrandWarlock,14/03/2022,https://newsverifierafrica.com/fact-checking-claims-on-sudans-independence-and-civil-wars-deaths/
CLAIM: PDP Won All Chairmanship and Councilor Seats at the 2022 FCT Polls,"Listen to this articleOn Sunday, February 13th, 2022, a Twitter user with the nameAhmed Shehutweeted that PDP won all chairmanship & councillorship seats in the FCT council polls conducted by INEC.In histweet,he stated that “PDP wins all chairmanship & councilorship seats in the council polls conducted by INEC Yesterday . in FCT Abuja…. The tweet had generated 37 comments, 190 quotes and retweets, and 615 likes as of the time of publishing this report.POTENTIAL IMPACT OF THE CLAIMNigeria is gearing up for the 2023 general elections, hence the need to fact-check all information disseminated on elections and their outcome.However, the tweet was shared by Ahmed Shehu whose profile revealed that he’s a Special Assistant to Adamawa State’s First lady, which makes it pertinent to verify this authenticity as devoid of misinformation or disinformation to political supporters.CLAIMN-VA extracted the claim, “PDP Won All Chairmanship and Councillor Seats at the 2022 FCT Polls” and went on to fact-check it.VERIFICATIONOn February 12, 2022, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) conducted elections in the six FCT area councils: Abaji, Abuja Municipal (AMAC), Bwari, Gwagwalada, Kuje, and Kwali, and for 62 council seats inwards across the FCT.A total of 14 political parties participated in the election, but two of the parties – All Progressives Congress (APC) and People’s Democratic Party (PDP), dominated the polls.According to a news report released byPremium Timestitled, “ANALYSIS: How FCT area council elections were won and lost” it was discovered that the results released by the electoral commission, INEC, contradict the claims of the Twitter user.On February 12, residents of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja, went to the polls to elect the chairpersons and councilors for the six area councils making up the territory. Over 1.3 million voters were registered to vote in the election across the 2,229 polling units in the nation’s capital. However, ahead of the election, INEC announced that the election would not be held in the newly-established 593 polling units because they had no registered voters. It deployed about 12,000 ad hoc staff for the election.The FCT election was the first to be organized by INEC in the New Year. The FCT poll is unique because, unlike Nigeria’s 36 states, the territory has no governor but is run by a minister who is appointed by the president of the country. Also, unlike in the 36 states where state electoral commissions organize the council elections, the FCT council elections are statutorily conducted by INEC.Premium Times reported that at the end of the exercise, two major parties won three councils apiece. While APC won in Gwagwalada, Kwali and Abaji, PDP won in AMAC, Bwari and Kuje.CONCLUSIONThe claims tweeted by Ahmed Shehu, that PDP won all seats for chairman and councilor in the 2022 FCT elections contradict the official results released by INEC. The results showed that the PDP and APC shared the seats, making the claims tweeted by ShehuFALSE.Post navigationCLAIM: Fact-checking Video Purportedly Showing Nigeria’s Fuel Scarcity Queue in 1974  Fact-Checking Claims on Sudan’s Independence and Civil Wars’ Deaths",BrandWarlock,28/02/2022,https://newsverifierafrica.com/claim-pdp-won-all-chairmanship-and-councilor-seats-at-the-2022-fct-polls/
CLAIM: Fact-checking Video Purportedly Showing Nigeria’s Fuel Scarcity Queue in 1974,"Listen to this articleAdeyemi OkediranA video has gone viral on the internet for the past few days. The video was said to be a recap of what Nigeria has experienced in the mid-1970.The caption in the viral video reads: “Fuel scarcity in 1974! Pls check if you can see the type of car you are using, if not, let’s take life easy! Nothing is permanent in this life!”POTENTIAL IMPACT OF THE CLAIMIt is important to fact-check whether this video shows fuel scarcity in the 1979s amidst the recent fuel scarcity in Nigeria at the moment.Nigeria has been experiencing nationwide fuel scarcity for the past 3 weeks, hence there is a need to confirm this viral video which may heighten the panic among the citizen.CLAIMN-VA extracted a screenshot from the video, and went on to fact-check and verify its authenticity.VERIFICATIONIs There Fuel Scarcity in 1974?According to an article published onWIKI,there is fuel scarcity between 1966 – 1975 duringGeneral Yakubu Gowon’sregime as Head of State when he increased the price of petrol from 6k to 8.45k.History of Fuel scarcity in NigeriaAccording to a report published onStatista,Nigeria was the leading oil producer in Africa as of 2020. Oil production amounted to 86.9 million metric tons in the country. Angola and Algeria followed with 64.5 million and 57.6 million metric tons, respectively. In the same year, the overall production of oil in Africa, including crude oil, shale oil, oil sands, and NGLs, reached 327.3 million metric tons. Moreover, the African output of oil per day amounted to some 8.4 million barrels in 2019, variating minimally compared to the previous year.For the past fifty years in Nigeria, fuel scarcity has often happened prior to a hike in fuel price. hence, the researcher took a long look at the history of fuel price hikes in Nigeria fromGeneral Yakubu Gowon’sadministration to date.General Yakubu Gowon(1966 – 1975) — During Gowon’s tenure as Head of State, he was said to have increased the price of petrol from 6k to 8.45k.General Murtala Mohammed(1975 – 1976) —Murtala Muhammed increased the pump price of petrol from 8.45k to 9k.Major General Olusegun Obasanjo(1976 – 1979)— Obasanjo increased the pump price from 9k to 15.3k during his time as President.Alhaji Shehu Shagari(1979 – 1983) — The civilian President increased the pump price of petrol by over 30% from 15.3k to 20k.General Ibrahim Babangida(1985 – 1993) — The pump price remained the same during Buhari’s time as President, but when Babangida assumed power, he increased the pump price a total of four times: 20k to 39.5k; 5k to 42k; 42k to 60k (Private Vehicles); and 60k to 70k.Ernest Shonekan(1993) — DuringErnest Shonekan’sbrief tenure, he increased the price of petrol by over 700% from 70k to N5General Sanni Abacha(1993 – 1998) — Abacha was in power for 5 years and his tenure was accompanied by fuel scarcity. Initially, he reduced the petrol prices from N5 to N25k but later increased it to N15 before reducing it to N11.General Abdulsalami Abubakar(1998 – 1999) — Abubakar was the interim President between 1998 and 1999 and his tenure saw some movements in terms of fuel price from N11 to N25, then to N20.Olusegun Obasanjo(1999 – 2007) — During Obasanjo’s tenure as President, the price of petrol experienced several changes over a period of eight years: N20 to N30; N30 to N22; N22 to N26; N26 to N42; N42 to N50; N50 to N65; and N65 to N75.President Umaru Musa Yaradua(2007 – 2010) —Yar’Adua was able to drop the price of petrol from N75 to N65 during his tenure as PresidentPresident Goodluck Jonathan(2010 – 2015) — The pump price changed three times during the tenure of Goodluck Jonathan from N65 to N141, then reduced to N97, dropped further to N87.President Muhammed Buhari(2015 till date) — Buhari increased the price of petrol from N87 to N143 in 2016.Before now, the mostrecent fuel scarcityissue happened in the last quarter of 2017. Another factor that causes fuel scarcity in Nigeria is the fuel subsidy payment by successive administrations.Therecent fuel scarcityissue in Nigeria began in February 2022 due to theimportation and distributionofadulterated PMSby NNPC and marketers in Nigeria.Does The Viral Video Truly Depict Fuel Scarcity in Nigeria in 1974?In the rare footage, very huge queues of vehicles can be seen, as motorists fight each other while waiting for their turn to buy petrol, and also the short clip gives you a glimpse of the types of car that plied the highways in the 1970s in NigeriaSome of the cars that were captured in the clip include a Volkswagen Beetle (Ijapa), Peugeot 504 Station Wagon, and 2nd-Generation Toyota Corolla Wagon.Watch this video on YouTubeOther iconic cars spotted include a Peugeot 404 sedan, fourth Generation Toyota Crown, Land Rover Defender, Land Rover, Renault 12, and Volkswagen Transporter bus.To ascertain the video’s authenticity, the researcher captured one of the scenes in the short clip and verified it through a reverse image search engine.The image was subjected toGoogle reverse image search, and it was confirmed that the video was shot in the 1970s.The one-minute clip first appeared online on May 25, 2021, when it was shared on YouTube by a recognized Nigerian automobile website, Autojosh giving insight into the nostalgic 1970s.https://youtu.be/L1_LBZNVSVA with an article https://autojosh.com/fuel-scarcity-in-1974-see-cars-in-vogue-in-the-70s-as-nigerians-queue-up-to-buy-fuel/CONCLUSIONThe video purportedly showing the fuel scarcity queue in Nigeria in 1974 isTRUE.Post navigationCLAIM: President Obama unveil Rochas Okorocha’s 2023 Presidential Campaign banner  CLAIM: PDP Won All Chairmanship and Councilor Seats at the 2022 FCT Polls",BrandWarlock,27/02/2022,https://newsverifierafrica.com/claim-fact-checking-video-purportedly-showing-nigerias-fuel-scarcity-queue-in-1974/

Once vaccines are approved by the FDA, companies can market the vaccines under brand names. COMIRNATY is the brand name for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. After FDA approval, the FDA-authorized Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for individuals ages 16 years and older was marketed as COMIRNATY.

Sabiradio’s watermark is telltale on the photograph.”“The Commission shall not hesitate to take urgent necessary steps to address this and other fake news seeking to drag EFCC’s hard-won name and professional reputation in the mud.”CONCLUSIONThe claim that Obi Cubana took a photograph with EFCC officers after he was released from the agency’s custody isMISLEADING.Post navigationCLAIM: Abeg App is Rewarding #BBNaija Fans with #30,000  CLAIM: African Union Commission is Relocating its Secretariat From Ethiopia",BrandWarlock,07/11/2021,https://newsverifierafrica.com/claim-obi-cubana-poses-with-efcc-officers/

The show just rounded up its sixth season, the grand finale held on October 3, 2021, with the winner going home with a grand prize of ₦90 Million, courtesy of Abeg App (headline sponsor), PATRICIA (associate sponsor), and other sponsors.The Abeg app known for sending and receiving money, paying bills, and buying quick airtime, went from a paltry 20,000 users to 1.8 million following its sponsorship of the biggest show in Africa, making it imperative to fact-check the claim.Throughout the 71 days in which housemates were in the house, #BBNaija had over 41.7 billion digital impressions with the Abeg app getting wide internet visibility, another reason why the claim needs to be fact-checked.VERIFICATIONWhat is Abeg App?According toTechcabalAbeg is a peer-to-peer (P2P) social payments platform that allows people to send or request money from another Abeg user without having to input any bank details.

How Religious Facebook Page Amplified COVID-19 Disinformation in Nigeria,"Listen to this articleZainab SanniShayo is a fierce anti-vaxxer who has used his WhatsApp status to campaign vigorously against COVID-19 protocols and in recent times, the COVID-19 vaccine. The middle aged young man says COVID-19 is a disease planted by Bill Gates and the United Nation to destabilize the church, adding that he has concerns about the content of the vaccine and its capacity to change the human system.Shayo also stated his firm belief in the power of prayers to cure the covid-19 disease. This position represents that of many other Nigerian Christians as a random sampling of opinions by this reporter in Bodija market, Ibadan, Oyo State revealed. Eight out of ten respondents noted that they believe Bill Gates and the United Nations were linked to the covid-19 disease. These same respondents affirm that they think the covid-19 vaccine can turn humans into vampires.Nine out ten people also confirmed their belief that prayers can cure the covid-19 disease.Earlier, an April 2020NOI Poll Surveywhich sought to ascertain the public’s perception of the coronavirus pandemic and the response of the Nigerian showed that 42% of respondents highlighted their belief in God as the reason they were immune to the virus.UNDERSTANDING HOW MANY NIGERIAN CHRISTIANS REACHED THIS CONCLUSIONAfter months of observation, our reporter engaged Shayo, the anti-vaxxer and he insists that his position on COVID-19 and the vaccine was reached via conclusions from independent research and his vast knowledge of public health diseases.Following an interview with our reporter, he however admitted to having gotten some information from a Facebook page, Church Channels.Church Channelsis an online Facebook group with over 30,000 likes and 53,000 followers. A careful study of posts made on the group in the last two years shows that it shares content from various Christian denominations but with more catholic content.At the start of the pandemic, the platform merely shared covid-19 news update but from April 2020, its covid-19 posts began to suggest that the pandemic could be a scam, that prayers can cure the pandemic and that the cure for covid-19 had been found by religious leaders.ANALYSING THE MISINFORMATION AND DISINFORMATION AVAILABLE ON CHURCH CHANNELSOn July 14, 2020, church channels shared a 27 minutes clip of the pastor of the Household of God Church International Ministries Reverend Chris Okotie claiming that the COVID-19 pandemic was part of a grand conspiracy theory, with the involvement of Satan.Okotie in the video described the COVID-19 vaccine as a “red herring” meant to disguise the intentions that could cause death on a large scale. The religious leader quoted the scripture to back his claims that Bill Gates and the United Nations manufactured the pandemic to stop the people of God from congregating together. One of the claims made in this video was that the vaccine will turn people into vampires and this is a position that has also gained popular acceptance among Christian anti-vaxxers like Shayo.This post on Church Channels, received over 99 shares –the largest number of shares out of over 40 posts checked by the reporter-.Several fact-checking platforms have debunked the claims made by Reverend Okotie. The fact-checks reached a conclusion that information made available by the World Health Organisation helps with the understanding that vaccines work in training to help the body’s natural defense, to fight any targeted virus or bacteria.A fact-check of this claim can be foundhereandhereOTHER POSTS SHARED BY THE PLATFORM ARE AS FOLLOWS:From April 2020-July 2020, Church Channels shared posts claiming that prayers could cure the pandemic or that a cure had been found for the pandemic. On April 30, a post on the platform read“NIGERIAN CATHOLIC MONKS DEVELOP “CVD PLUS” FOR THE TREATMENT OF COVID-19”Also on May 6, 2020. another post on the same platform claim that the Anambra Traditional Medicine Board had found a cure for COVID-19 and on July 7, 2020, the platform claimed a christian denomination,The Lord’s Chosen Charismatic Revival Church had anihilated COVID-19 in South Africa.CONCLUSIONAll the Church channels posts encouraging Nigerians to turn to prayer for covid-19 cures and declaring it a scam were made between April-July 2020 with a recurring call for the federal government to reopen churches.The Nigerian government had in March 2020 announced a covid-19 lockdown which included a ban on public gatherings that affected religious gatherings. The government announced that churches could reopen in June 2020 but the Lagos State –the country’s commercial hub and epicenter for the pandemic- government did not allow churches to reopen until July.It was also within this period that many religious leaders shared COVID-19 disinformation that went viral. Two examples that readily come to mind are Pastor Chris Oyakhilome of Loveworld Incoporated also known as Christ Embassy and Bishop David Oyedepo, the founder of Living Faith TabernaclePastor Oyakhilome in videos that surfaced online on April 6, 2020, a week after the total lockdown commenced, said 5G towers which were being installed are designed to weaken humans’ immune system and allow an attack from the coronavirus disease. He added that the purpose of the COVID-19 lockdown was to enable the government to install more 5G towers.Bishop David Oyedepo, the founder of Living Faith Tabernacle remains a known critic of covid-19 and the vaccine but his first anti-covid statement available online was published by a news platform in June 2020 and the statement condemned the continuous closure of churches.The cleric was quoted as saying that COVID-19 has suddenly become an anti-church in a sermon with the title “Breaking Invisible Barrier.” and on June 28, 2020, the cleric would also claim that he had healed 114 COVID-19 cases.Shayo, the Public health expert, isn’t ready to take the COVID-19 vaccine after continued interactions with the Facebook page, Church Channels. He is also an ardent follower of Pastor Chris Oyakhilome. Like him, many other Christians respondents indicated an unwillingness to take the vaccine owing to support for the position of some or all of these religious leaders and in some cases, information gotten from the posts on Church ChannelsBut research have shown that the various positions of these religious leaders and other covid-19 prayer claims and miraculous cure are eitherUNVERIFIEDorFALSE .This publication was produced as part of IWPR’s Africa Resilience Network (ARN) programme, administered in partnership with the Centre for Information Resilience (CIR), the International Centre for Investigative Reporting (ICIR), and Africa Uncensored.Post navigationCLAIM: UN Has Spoken About Nigeria’s Break-Up at a Meeting Held in Geneva  CLAIM: Abeg App is Rewarding #BBNaija Fans with #30,000",BrandWarlock,29/06/2021,https://newsverifierafrica.com/how-religious-facebook-page-amplified-covid-19-disinformation-in-nigeria/
CLAIM: UN Has Spoken About Nigeria’s Break-Up at a Meeting Held in Geneva,"Listen to this articleOkediran AdeyemiOn Saturday, June 26, 2021, a user with a pseudo name,Joesandon the microblogging website, Twitter tweeted that, “Finally UN has spoken about Nigeria break-up, holds meeting in Geneva”, with a youtube link attached to his post.As of the time of fact-checking this claim, no one has engaged this tweet, whileyoutubehas generated 37,820 views and 1,100 likes.CLAIMN-VA extracted the claim, “UN Has Spoken About Nigeria’s Break-Up at a Meeting Held in Geneva,” and went on to fact-check and verify its authenticity.POTENTIAL IMPACT OF THE CLAIMThis post was made at the time when the southern and the western region of Nigeria are agitating for secession.It also coincides with the moment that the Federal Government re-arrested the leader of the Southeast secessionist group, the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, and the State’s Secret Police, DSS, invaded and ransacked the home of Oduduwa republic agitator, Sunday Igboho.VERIFICATIONThe fact-checker checked the daily meeting schedules of the United Nations and discovered that no event or meeting was slated to hold to discuss talks about Nigeria’s situation as claimed in the video. But, further, a click on the YouTube link shared by the Twitter user toon is to the Channel titled, Critics News, and a description of that particular post read: “Finally UN Has Spoken About Nigeria Break-Up, Holds Meeting In Geneva; Big Police Convert Car In…”It was noted that the video was a news round-up session where one of the top stories was on the UN speaking about Nigeria’s break up as shared by the Deputy Secretary-General (DSG) of the United Nations, Amina Mohammed, at a public forum.Watch this video on YouTubeThe video being referenced to have contained Mohammed’s assertion was uploaded by Channels TV on its YouTube channel on Friday, June 25, 2021. It was news coverage of the DSG while she was delivering a lecture in Abuja. She explained the UN’s stand on Nigeria’s situation while also addressing the use of ceasefire agreements to avoid escalation of armed conflict in Abuja.According to her, conflicts are more complex in these times with the emergence of non-state actors waging asymmetrical war on sovereign nations.She clarified the misinformation that the UN does not have any voice on human rights is not true, as there have been spokesman statements, human rights commission statements on human rights in Nigeria.Mohammed said; “there was a meeting three days ago in Geneva about this country, Nigeria, and a lack of access and human rights. So when you want to say nothing is happening, define what you mean by nothing.”“With every right comes an obligation, to tell the truth, and the truth in many cases comes in different colours depending on who is telling it and you need to try to be faithful to that because when you say a mistruth it has an impact on people’s lives and I’ll continue to say it that this government is not a saint, and it is very far from it, but there are things that we can do to make it better and that’s the challenge I am throwing to everyone. If you don’t want to build this nation, I don’t know where else you want to go.”The DSG made it known that there is so much that goes into preventing the crisis for how long before it eventually happens and at the end of the day there is not so much that the UN can do in a country that’s in crisis as it is a sovereign country and you can’t just walk into it and do what you want to do.CONCLUSIONThe claim that the UN spoke about Nigeria’s break-up at a meeting held in Geneva is MISLEADING as the meeting referenced by the DSG was truly held in said location but the agenda was on human rights violation in Nigeria.Post navigation How Religious Facebook Page Amplified COVID-19 Disinformation in Nigeria",BrandWarlock,26/06/2021,https://newsverifierafrica.com/claim-un-has-spoken-about-nigerias-break-up-at-a-meeting-held-in-geneva/
