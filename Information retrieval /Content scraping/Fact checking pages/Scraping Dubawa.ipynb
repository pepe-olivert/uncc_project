       "'The murder and armed robbery attacks on the home of Liberia’s former Chief Justice, Gloria Musu-Scott, have been greeted with several accusations, one of which is coming from the family of Justice Scott.\\nCharloe Musu, daughter of Justice Scott, was murdered on the morning of Thursday,\\xa0 February 23, 2023, at Justice Scott’s residence in Brewville on the outskirt of the city.\\nOther members of the household suffered injuries in the attack. It is not yet clear the motive for the murder and the attack but the news of the murder has since gone viral.\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe police have since begun an investigation into the matter.\\nWhile citizens look forward to a speedy investigation and the arrest of the culprits, there have been some allegations and counter-allegations. One such is from the family of the former Chief Justice.\\xa0\\nOn March 6, 2023, the family issued a statement accusing the ruling party chairman, Mulbah Morlu, of making statements against the family.\\nThe statement partly reads, “On Thursday, March 2, 2023, the chairman of the ruling Coalition for Democratic Change – CDC, Mulbah Morlu, had a Press Conference at the CDC headquarters in Sinkor. It was held immediately after the Liberian Women Sit-in Action in protest at the Legislature on Capitol Hill seat against the murder and assault against the Musu family.”\\nThe family statement accused Mr Morlu of saying Charloe was killed for “ritualistic purposes.”\\nThe murder of Charloe has triggered widespread, vehement public condemnation in the country.\\xa0\\nThe institutions and groups that have expressed disdain over the attacks include the Liberia National Bar Association, former Vice President and Standard bearer of the former ruling Unity Party, Joseph Nyuma Boakai.\\nThe gravity of the situation involving former Chief Justice Gloria Musu Scott and her daughter’s death and the accusation against the party chairman form the basis for this fact-check.\\nGiven the sensitive nature of the claim, DUBAWA decided to contact the family for evidence of its claim against the party chairman. But the family of the former Chief Justice, when contacted for a response, declined to verify the claim as indicated in their Press statement.\\nThe Family spokesperson Julius Musu in a telephone conversation with this researcher, said the family would not respond to the inquiry seeking answers over an allegation raised in their most recent release.\\n“All I can tell you is that the matter is before the police, and the family is cooperating, and that is all for now,” Julius Musu said on the phone.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe researcher scrutinised the video of March 2, 2023, press conference, which formed the basis of the ritual murder accusation attributed to Mr Morlu. From the scrutiny, it is clear there was no such accusation in the video.\\nThough the family statement alleged that Chairman Morlu of President Weah’s ruling Coalition said their daughter was used for ritual, he debunked the claim via telephone interview with OK FM on March 6, 2023.\\nHis rebuttal, which can be heard between the 2:04:05sec on the show, among other things, rejected the claim, “that is not true, I never said that. Several credible media institutions covered my press conference. The videos are out there.”\\nThe claim by the former chief justice, Gloria Musu Scott’s family, which accuses Mr Weah’s three-party government chairman Mulbah Morlu of saying that Charloe Musu, daughter of Justice Scott, was killed for ritual purposes, is false.'"

      "While their legs are stretched forward to avoid the flooded floor, their gloomy faces cast the hopelessness of their reality; one of the claimants said he would not wish such for the children of his enemies. \n",
      "Mr Christopher, who subtly implies the picture depicts the state of primary education in Nigeria, then suggests a solution, advising users to save the image as a reminder to vote wisely in the upcoming general elections in Nigeria, adding that Labour Party (LP) will guarantee a better Nigeria. \n",
      "“Just look at this picture. Would you even want your enemies’ children to be in classrooms of this nature? Save it on your phone as a reminder when you go to the polling station on 25 February 2023. You will vote LP for a better Nigeria,” he tweeted. \n",
      "A screenshot of Mr Christopher’s tweet on Nigeria’s alleged state of classrooms.\n",
      "Like most politically motivated claims online, the post generated over a thousand views, with some reactions and retweets. \n",
      "Many experts have criticised President Buhari’s administration for poor governance. In 2020, Nigeria’s GDP had a negative growth rate of 3.2% due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, by 2022, data shows the country’s expenditure on education has reduced to about four to five per cent of the annual budget, while private education increased rapidly.\n",
      "Even worse, in 2022, the floods ravaged over 34 states out of 36, displacing over 2.8 million people and killing many, attracting criticism and concern over the state of things in Nigeria. Perhaps, based on this context, Mr Christopher is building this alleged narrative. But is the picture from Nigeria? \n",
      "Verification\n",
      "DUBAWA first conducted a Google reverse image search on the alleged image to track its origin online. The results revealed the image has been online since 2019, and its surrounding narratives have much to do with Kenya, not Nigeria. \n",
      "In 2019, the image went viral in the Kenyan social media space. The origin narrative depicted students of Mangororomu Primary school in Ganze, Kilifi, Kenya, sitting on mud blocks as their classroom is filled with rainwater. It was first published by The Star News, a Kenyan-based digital platform, on May 9. 2019, with the headline: \n",
      "“Uproar as Kilifi children taught in flooded classroom”\n",
      "A screenshot of the published news story by Star News.\n",
      "Tuko, an award-winning digital news platform in Kenya, also published a news story on the picture, with the headline: Kilifi: Netizens angered by a viral photo of pupils sitting on bricks in flooded classroom \n",
      "Both the news sources detail how barefooted pupils sat on stone blocks as muddy rainwater swirled around them in a leaking mud-wall classroom in Ganze constituency, Kilifi, Kenya, not in Nigeria. \n",
      "DUBAWA found that the image was also used elsewhere to misinform the public. In November 2022, the same image was falsely used to depict the state of classrooms in Boki, Cross River, in Nigeria. However,  an Africa Check’s fact-check debunked the claim, linking it to the Kenyan narrative. \n",
      "Conclusion \n",
      "The alleged image used to depict the state of classrooms in Nigeria is falsely used. The image is originally from Kenya and was first shared in 2019. \n",

       "'In a recent interview on Arise TV, a former commissioner of health in Cross River state and the current National  Women Leader of the ruling All Progressive Congress, APC made various claims regarding the recent elections. Speaking about the national parliamentary elections, Ms Edu said:\\n“I want to put this to the fore that APC won the House of Representative seats except that of the Northern part of the state. So, APC won in the central, APC won in the south, and we only lost in the Northern part of the state.”\\xa0\\nOn the state governorship elections, she said:\\n“The Labour Party won [the presidential election in the state], APC came close second, and then PDP came far third. Going into the next election, Labour Party doesn’t have a candidate.” Ms Betta added, “for PDP, we are not worried about them. They are not a threat to us. We are discussing with them and working hand in hand with them because they do not even have a governorship candidate. They will work with us in APC.”\\xa0\\nIn verifying the claim that the APC swept all the House of Representatives seats in the central and southern part of the state, DUBAWA looked through the list of members-elect of the House of Representatives shared by the Independent National Electoral Commission.\\xa0\\nOn the list published by INEC, of the eight seats, PDP won the two available slots in the Northern Senatorial District. APC won all three available seats in the Central Senatorial District, while the APC took two seats and LP one seat in the Southern Senatorial District.\\nUnder the column for Cross River State and number 81 on the overall list, Akiba Bassey Ekpenyong of the Labour Party is listed as the winner of the Calabar Municipality/Odukpani Federal Representative Seat.\\xa0\\nWhile INEC has yet to upload a comprehensive list of governorship candidates, information from credible media houses such as Vanguard and Daily Post show that Mr Ogar Osim is the Labour Party’s candidate for the governorship seat in the State alongside Ekpezu Obu as his running mate.\\xa0\\nFollowing claims made by the APC in Cross River that the party was working hand-in-glove with the Labour Party, the State Publicity Secretary of the Labour Party, Dr Lekan Ofem, denied the existence of such arrangement, insisting that the party “has a Governorship Candidate in the person of Patriarch Ogar Osim who is in the race to victory.”\\xa0\\nClaims by Ms Edu that the APC had won all the available House of Representatives seats in the Central and Southern part of Cross River State in last month’s elections are misleading, as the party lost the Calabar Municipality/Odukpani seat to Bassey Akiba of LP.\\xa0\\nAlso, the claim that the Labour Party has no governorship candidate in this Saturday’s polls is false, as Mr Osim is flying the LP’s flag in the elections.\\xa0\\n'"
